   SAN SALVADOR, 3 JAN 90 -- [REPORT] [ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE,
COPREFA] [TEXT] THE ARCE BATTALION COMMAND HAS REPORTED THAT ABOUT 50
PEASANTS OF VARIOUS AGES HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY TERRORISTS OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] IN SAN MIGUEL
DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO THAT GARRISON, THE MASS KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE ON
30 DECEMBER IN SAN LUIS DE LA REINA.  THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THE TERRORISTS
FORCED THE INDIVIDUALS, WHO WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION, OUT OF
THEIR RESIDENCES, PRESUMABLY TO INCORPORATE THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL INTO
CLANDESTINE GROUPS.

   MEANWHILE, THREE SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED AND SEVEN OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
DURING CLASHES YESTERDAY IN USULUTAN AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS.  THE ATONAL
BATTALION REPORTED THAT ONE EXTREMIST WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE
WOUNDED DURING A CLASH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON NEAR LA ESPERANZA FARM, SANTA
ELENA JURISDICTION, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED AND TAKEN TO THE MILITARY
HOSPITAL IN THIS CAPITAL.

   THE SAME MILITARY UNIT REPORTED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CLASH THAT RESULTED
IN ONE DEAD TERRORIST AND THE SEIZURE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF WAR MATERIEL NEAR
SAN RAFAEL FARM IN THE SAME TOWN.

   IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION, MILITARY DETACHMENT NO.4 REPORTED THAT A
TERRORIST WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH IN LA RANERA
STREAM, SAN CARLOS, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.  AN M-16 RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CLIPS, AND
AMMUNITION WERE SEIZED THERE.

   MEANWHILE, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE REPORTED THAT PONCE BATTALION UNITS
FOUND THE DECOMPOSED BODY OF A SUBVERSIVE IN LA FINCA HILL, SAN MIGUEL.  AN

FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE.  THE BRIGADE, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN SAN MIGUEL,
ADDED THAT THE SEIZURE WAS MADE YESTERDAY MORNING. 

   NATIONAL GUARD UNITS GUARDING THE LAS CANAS BRIDGE, WHICH IS ON THE
NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN APOPA, THIS MORNING REPELLED A TERRORIST ATTACK
THAT RESULTED IN NO CASUALTIES.  THE ARMED CLASH INVOLVED MORTAR AND RIFLE
FIRE AND LASTED 30 MINUTES.  MEMBERS OF THAT SECURITY GROUP ARE COMBING THE
AREA TO DETERMINE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FIGHTING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY A
SALVADORAN OFFICER TODAY, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE ITS NORMAL ACTIVITIES.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE MAINTAINS THE SAME OPERATIONAL LEVEL IT HAS HAD
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, DESPITE THE REMOVAL OF ITS TOP COMMANDER, JAUN RAFAEL
BUSTILLOS, THIS WEEK.

   PARATROOPER BATTALION COMMANDER MAJOR RENE RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID TODAY
THAT THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND
TO MAINTAIN A SIMILAR OPERATIONAL LEVEL.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "WE KNOW GENERAL VILLAMARIONA [NEW AIR FORCE COMMANDER] ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR BATTALION'S ATTACKS ON ALL THE
TERRORIST CRIMINALS' REDOUBTS.  WE DEPEND DIRECTLY ON THE GENERAL STAFF,
SINCE IT IS THE STRATEGIC HEAD OF THE ENTIRE ARMY.  THE GENERAL STAFF GIVES
US OUR ORDERS TO LAUNCH OUR OPERATIONS."

   MAJOR RODRIGUEZ HURTADO TODAY DENIED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAD
ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT SAID LAST WEEK.
MAJ RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES HAVE NEVER
ENTERED THE NEIGHBORING TERITORY OF NICARAGUA.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE WERE NEITHER SALVADORAN NOR
HONDURAN PLANES.  IN MY OPINION, THE SANDINISTS WANT TO INVENT AN EXCUSE TO
CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  OURS
AND THE HONDURAN PLANES ARE SMALL PLANES.  I DO NOT THINK THAT HONDURAN
PLANES ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY.  THOSE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO INVENT
AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS."

   MAJ. RODRIGUEZ MADE THESE STATEMENTS DURING THE PRESENTATION OF A NUMBER
OF WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION ON 4 JANUARY.

   [RODRIGUEZ] "HERE WE HAVE 12 RIFLES, 11 AR-15 RIFLES AND 1 AK-47 RIFLE;
4,000 CARTRIDGES, OF WHICH 2,000 ARE FOR M-16 MACHINE GUNS AND 2,000 FOR
AK-47 RIFLES; 36 CARTRIDGES OF AN UNKNOWN CALIBER-- MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
HAS ALREADY BEEN INFORMED OF THIS DISCOVERY; AND I (ICON) RADIO OF THE TYPE
USED BY THE LEADERS OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS."

   THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND AT EL NISPERO CREEK NEAR THE SACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.
AMONG THE CONFISCATED WEAPONS WERE CARTRIDGES OF UNKNOWN MAKE.  THIS IS
APPPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME THE ARMY HAS FOUND THAT TYPE OF CARTRIDGE. MAJ
RODRIGUEZ HURTADO SAID THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WILL PROCEED TO ESTABLISH
THE ORIGIN OF THESE CARTRIDGES AND THE WEAPONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED.


DEV-MUC3-0003 (NOSC)

   SANTIAGO, 5 JAN 90 -- [EXCERPTS] THE GOVERNMENT JUNTA YESTERDAY APPROVED A
DRAFT BILL TO "MODIFY LAW 18314, WHICH DEFINES TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND
ESTABLISHES PENALTIES."  THE BILL WILL RESTRICT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW
TO THE MOST SERIOUS CASES AND WILL LEAVE OTHER CRIMES, THAT WERE FORMERLY
CONSIDERED TERRORIST ACTIVITY, FOR TRIAL UNDER COMMON LAW.

   THE NEW BILL ACCEPTS THE POSSIBILITY IN SOME CASES OF A PRISONER BEING
RELEASED ON BAIL OR RECEIVING A PARDON OR AMNESTY.  THE BILL ALSO
ESTABLISHES OTHER BENEFITS NOT CONTEMPLATED BY LAW 18314, INCLUDING A NEW
PROCEEDINGS FOR SPEEDIER TRIALS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   ACCORDING TO RETIRED GENERAL FERNANDO TORRES SILVA, WHO IS THE ARMY JUDGE
ADVOCATE GENERAL, THE MODIFICATIONS ESTABLISH LIGHTER SENTENCES, FREEDOM ON
BAIL, AND POSSIBLE PARDONS OR AMNESTIES.  THESE BENEFITS WERE NOT
CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE FORMER ANTITERRORIST LAW.

   AS AN EXAMPLE TORRES CITED THAT "SENTENCES OF INDIVIDUALS TRIED AS
ACCOMPLICES WILL BE LOWER.  THEY WILL RECEIVE LOWER SENTENCES THAN THAT
PREVIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED."

   THE NEW BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRIED
BY THE INTERIOR MINISTRY TO GO OUT ON BAIL.

   ACCORDING THE GENERAL ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, MORE THAN 1,000 PRISONERS MIGHT
BENEFIT FROM THE MODIFICATIONS.

   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?

   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.

INDICATES THAT ON 6 JANUARY AT 1625, FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE CAVALRY COMPANY IN FINCA
SANTA ELENA, SANTA TECLA, NEAR SAN SALVADOR, KILLING THREE AND
WOUNDING FOUR ENEMY TROOPS, INCLUDING THE PATROL LEADER WHO WAS AMONG
THOSE KILLED.  OUR TROOPS SEIZED AN M-14 RIFLE FROM THE ENEMY, 3,000
CARTRIDGES FOR A 7.62-MM RIFLE, FIVE KNAPSACKS, SIX GRENADES, AND

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR,
WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY
MILITARY SOURCES.

   THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700
CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY.  SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS.

   IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED
THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE.  DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD
BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS
CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME,
WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS.

   IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO
REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE.

   FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE
CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH
BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG
BASTIONS.

   THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.  AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL
EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM
GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD.  THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO
ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION.

   THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND
THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ENTRANCES AND EXITS.

   IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX
FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   LAST NIGHT THERE WERE FEWER ATTACKS ON STORES AND ELECTRIC TOWERS IN THE
CAPITAL.  THERE WERE ALSO THREATS OF POWER RATIONING IF THESE ACTIONS
CONTINUED.

   SANTIAGO, 9 JAN 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [OLGA KLIVADENKO] [TEXT] THE
DEPLOYMENT OF U.S.  SHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "JOHN F.
KENNEDY" AND THE CORVETTE "VIRGINIA" ALONG THE COLOMBIAN COAST YESTERDAY,
SEEKING TO INTERCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES, COULD BE THE RESULT OF THREE
POLICIES:

   FIRST, THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
UNDER THE EXCUSE OF ITS FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   SECOND, THAT BOTH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SHIPS AND THE INVASION OF PANAMA ARE
PART OF A SERIOUS MILITARY PLAN TO END THE DRUG PLAGUE.

   THIRD, THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
AND THE NEED TO RECOVER ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HAS PROVIDED A REAL
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   IF THE OBJECTIVE REALLY IS TO ELIMINATE DRUGS, THEN THE BATTLE IS
PRAISEWORTHY, BUT--LIKE IN PANAMA--THE PROCEDURE IS PAINFUL, OVERBEARING,
IMPERIALISTIC, AND HUMILIATING.  INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED
STATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.  THE SIDE
EFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE
COOPERATING.  ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN
THIS PHASE?

   COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS,
INSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH,
PERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC
CONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND
THUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION?  IF THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WE
MUST ASK, WHY?

   FROM ITS OPERATIONS IN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING
US THAT IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT FOR THE TIME BEING.
THE UNITED STATES WANTS ACTION AND EFFICIENCY.  THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING
ITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF
LATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.

   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE
UNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL
CARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF.  DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL
DISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH
HIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS.  PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF
THE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY
OF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC.

   DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE.
WHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING?  AS WE
SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE:
COULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY
TO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES
WHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND
BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS?  AND ALL THIS WHILE A
LARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A
DEADLY PRODUCT?

   THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES?  CAN
THOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND
CORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT,
HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE
AND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS?  WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS
HASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT
CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES?

   LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH
MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN
AN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING; AND MAINLY, LET US RECALL THE
EVER-PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE FACED WHEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS
MUST BE PUNISHED AND EXTRADITED.

ACHI, IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT OF BOLIVAR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5
JANUARY, APPARENTLY BY ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLAS, WAS
FOUND DEAD TODAY, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES.

   CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED ON 5 JANUARY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ACHI, ABOUT 850
KM NORTH OF BOGOTA, BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN, WHO FORCED HIM TO ACCOMPANY
THEM TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

   POLICE SOURCES IN CARTAGENA REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR'S BODY SHOWED SIGNS OF
TORTURE AND SEVERAL BULLET WOUNDS.

   CASTELLAR WAS KIDNAPPED BY ELN GUERRILLAS WHILE HE WAS TRAVELING IN A BOAT
DOWN THE CAUCA RIVER TO THE TENCHE AREA, A REGION WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION.

   IN CARTAGENA IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTELLAR FACED A "REVOLUTIONARY TRIAL"
BY THE ELN AND THAT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND EXECUTED.

   CASTELLAR IS THE SECOND MAYOR THAT HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA IN THE

CORDOVA LEFT THE EMBASSY.  THE MILITARY MAN, WHO IS INVOLVED IN A
MURDER TRIAL, LEFT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE

BIT.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE SOUGHT PROTECTION....[CHANGES THOUGHT]
SOMEONE ARRIVES AT THE DOOR OF THE EMBASSY AND ASKS FOR REFUGE IN VIEW OF A
SITUATION OF FORCE.  THE SITUATION IN PANAMA IS ABNORMAL; IT HAS BEEN
TOTALLY INVADED BY 30,000 SOLDIERS.

   SOME PERSONS ENTERED THE EMBASSY.  AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN ALLEGEDLY
LINKED WITH THE DEATH OF A PANAMANIAN MINISTER, A MR SPADAFORA, WHO WAS
MURDERED. THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EMBASSY AND OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATED
THAT THIS PERSON'S PRESENCE WAS UNDESIRABLE.  WE DO NOT REFUSE TO GRANT
REFUGE--A CONDITION THAT IS GRANTED BEFORE GRANTING POLITICAL ASYLUM--TO
WHOMEVER FEELS HARASSED OR MISTREATED.  IN A CASE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER, IN
WHICH THERE WAS AN ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A MURDER WHICH WAS COMMITTED YEARS
AGO, THIS PERSON--I BELIEVE HE IS A MAN SURNAMED CORDOVA, APPARENTLY A
HIGHRANKING PANAMANIAN GUARD OFFICER--WAS TOLD THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT
WANTED.  HE LEFT THE EMBASSY OF HIS OWN WILL.

   THERE ARE OTHER PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS AT THE EMBASSY,
INCLUDING MR NORIEGA'S SECRETARY, BUT THEIR STATUS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY
PERU.

   AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED YESTERDAY, AS THE U.S. TROOPS SURROUNDED THE
EMBASSY, DEPLOYING BARRIERS AND BARBED WIRE.

   THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEPICT A DRAMATIC AND SPECTACULAR PICTURE OF A

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS EXPRESSED
SATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND
IS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF
THIS CRIME.

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS
PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE
PUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL
LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR.

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY
THAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO
WHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE
DETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON.

   HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT
INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME
OUT.  THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL
SALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR
THEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY
LITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED.
[END RECORDING]

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED
SINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A
POLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY
JUSTICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.
HE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY,
AND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL
VIOLENCE.  THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS
POSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES.  WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY
VIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE.  MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS.  THE
LANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH.  I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A
CALMER CLIMATE. [END RECORDING]

   HE ADDED THAT A CLIMATE OF SERENITY AND RESPECT WOULD FACILITATE THE RIGHT
CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD GUARANTEE MECHANISMS TO RECONCILE OUR
SOCIETY.  HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE
MAKING PROGRESS IN THE REVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO REORGANIZE IT IN A
WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THE HONEST ADMINSTRATION OF JUSTICE TO DO AWAY WITH
IMPUNITY.

ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES"
PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."

   SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT."  HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED,
ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF
SOLVING THE CASE.

   "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN
THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE
MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES
CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS.

   ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE
ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND
THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN
VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION."

   AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE
AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF
THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.

THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS AND HEAVY FIGHTING TOOK PLACE THE EVENING
OF 9 JANUARY AND THIS MORNING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND AS A RESULT,
THREE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS INJURED.

   ALLEGED GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS LAUNCHED TWO HIGHPOWER BOMBS AGAINST A
CAR DEALERSHIP IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING.  A POLICE REPORT SAID
THAT THE ATTACK SET THE BUILDING ON FIRE, BUT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY
CASUALTIES ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC LOSSES ARE HEAVY.

   DURING THE EVENING OF 9 JANUARY, GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS BOMBED TWO
ELECTRICITY FACILITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CAUSED
POWER OUTAGES IN SOME AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.

U.S.  CITIZEN BEING HELD IN PRISON WHILE AWAITING TRIAL ON
DRUG-TRAFFICKING CHARGES, HAS BEEN STABBED TO DEATH IN THE PAVON PRISON
CAMP, 18 KM SOUTHEAST OF THIS CAPITAL.

   KENT JR, AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME AND NATIONALITY THE POLICE HAVE NOT
REVEALED, WERE ARRESTED IN JULY 1989 ALONG THE SOUTHERN COAST OF GUATEMALA
WHEN THE LIGHT PLANE IN WHICH THE TWO WERE TRAVELING HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY LANDING.

   ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT FOLLOWED, THE PLANE WAS TRANSPORTING
COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA TO THE UNITED STATES.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT KENT JR WAS UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED BY
THREE OTHER PAVON PRISON INMATES WIELDING KNIVES.

   PRISON GUARDS CAPTURED THE ATTACKERS BUT DID NOT REPORT THEIR NAMES.

   PRISON SYSTEM DIRECTOR LEONEL FRANCO STATED TODAY THAT THE AMERICAN HAD
NOT BEEN SENTENCED AND THAT HIS CASE WAS BEING PROCESSED BY A COURT OF
JUSTICE.

   ON 28 SEPTEMBER, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA HAD REQUESTED THE
EXTRADITION OF KENT JR FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG-TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES
AND BECAUSE OF HIS POSSIBLE LINKS WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   CLANDESTINE, 11 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] REGARDING THE JESUITS' CASE, THE FMLN STATES THAT:

   1. THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,
WERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE
CRIME.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE
CASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],
MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR
THE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE
WERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP
THE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

   2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE
THIS CASE.  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM
SHOULD BE PUNISHED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT
THE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.  MOST
IMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS
BECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE TOP COMMAND.

   3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS
CONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE
OF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND
ORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND
STOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.  

   4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED
DISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS
AID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE
RESOLVED.  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE
THAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.  WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE
THIS DECISION.  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING
EFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.

   5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING
PROGRESS.  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE
COULD BE REACHED EARLIER.

   6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH
US AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE
DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

   7. THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.  IT URGES
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE
INVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH
STATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST
RESPONSIBLE.  THIS WOULD PUSH AWAY THE POSSIBILTIY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND FRANCISCO JOVEL.

   BOGOTA, 11 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES, THE FARC [REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] LAUNCHED A NEW
OFFENSIVE TO RECOVER THE REGION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA THAT WAS LOST TO GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS MEN 5 YEARS AGO.  THIS IS THE REASON FOR FIERCE
FIGHTING THERE BETWEEN THE ARMY AND SEVERAL FARC FRONTS DURING THE FIRST FEW
DAYS OF THIS YEAR.  HEAVILY ARMED AND STRENGTHENED THESE FRONTS ARE TRYING
TO MILITARILY TAKE OVER AREAS THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN
VACATING BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS CREATED IN THEIR ORGANIZATION BY THE DEATH OF
EL MEJICANO [GONZALO RODRIGUEZ' ALIAS].

   THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THE RETURN TO THE STRATEGY OF USING
KIDNAPPINGS AS A MEANS TO FINANCE ITSELF IS ALSO PART OF THIS NEW OFFENSIVE
THAT SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THE SUPPORT OF OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS SUCH AS THE
EPL [POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY].

   MEANWHILE, IN LA URIBE THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT HAS SUBMITTED ANOTHER
PEACE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  THE GUERRILLA GROUP STATES THAT IT IS
WILLING TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL PARTY CALLED BOLIVARIAN REUNION OF THE
PEOPLE [REUNION BOLIVARIANA DEL PUEBLO] IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS A PLESBICITE
TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   THE PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED ON 9 JANUARY DIRECTLY FROM THE HANDS OF FARC
LEADERS BY MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY BOARD FOR PEACE ISSUES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [RAFAEL PARDO, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR PEACE AND
REHABILITATION] THE GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS THE PROPOSAL IT HAS RECEIVED, AS
WELL AS FARC'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT SHOULD RESUME
TALKS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION. [END RECORDING]

   FOR THE TIME BEING, MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL TRAVEL TO SANTO
DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND TO CONTINUE STUDYING WITH THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT]
THE POSSIBILITIES OF INCORPORATING IT INTO POLITICAL LIFE FOLLOWING THE
COLLAPSE OF THE SPECIAL PEACE DISTRICT ISSUE IN CONGRESS.

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION."
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY."

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.
MILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE
CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.

DEFENSE MINISTER ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR.

   GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ SALVADOR, CHIEF OF THE 7TH SUBREGION OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE, HAS CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEAFLETS, AND ADDED THAT THE
MURDER CASE IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAID THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF DETAINEES THERE ARE 16 SUSPECTS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
THE MURDER OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, THERE ARE TWO OPERATIONS.  FIRST,
THE DRAGNET OPERATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS ESTABLISHED
BY WITNESSES ARE ARRESTED, AND SECOND, THERE IS A MORE SPECIFIC OPERATION
BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIALIZED UNITS.

   [REPORTER] IS THERE ANY INFORMATION YET REGARDING THE CAPTURE OF THE
MURDERERS OF THE FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] THESE OPERATIONS SEEK TO CLEAR UP BOTH A CRIME THAT HAS
SHOCKED THE NATION AND ALSO THE KILLING OF TWO PATROLMEN WHO WERE MURDERED
IN COLD BLOOD THE DAY BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS MURDERED.

   [REPORTER] DO THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIKITS OF THE MURDERERS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME IDENTIKITS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK FROM THE SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE TECHNICAL
POLICE.  BASED ON THESE IDENTIKITS THE POLICE WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC AND
SELECTIVE.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY IDENTIKITS DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE IDENTIKITS.

   [REPORTER] THE MURDER IS ATTRIBUTED TO MRTA AND NOT TO THE SHINING PATH.
WHAT NEWS DO THE HAVE ON THIS?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] I BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL HAVE THE FINAL
WORD ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
MURDER?

   [DIAZ SALVADOR] WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME LEAFLETS HAVE APPEARED TODAY
INSIDE A NEWSPAPER THAT CLAIMS TO BE THE MOUTHPIECE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THIS IS FINAL.  [END RECORDING]

IN LA PAZ LAST NIGHT, ONE IN FRONT OF GOVERNMENT HOUSE FOLLOWING THE

JAIME PAZ ZAMORA.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY SERIOUS DAMAGE BUT THE POLICE WERE
MOBILIZED, FEARING A WAVE OF ATTACKS.

   THE SELF-STYLED "ZARATE WILLKA LIBERATION ARMED FORCES" SENT SIMULTANEOUS
WRITTEN MESSAGES TO THE MEDIA, CALLING ON THE PEOPLE TO OPPOSE THE

EXPLOITERS."  IT ALSO CALLS FOR FREE EDUCATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
PERMANENT JOBS, THE DEFENSE OF COCA-LEAF FARMING, AND THE DEFENSE AGAINST
U.S. INTERVENTION AND BIG LAND OWNERS.

   THE FIRST BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2230 [0230 GMT ON 12 JANUARY] IN FRONT
OF THE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC COORDINATION MINISTRY, JUST BEFORE PRESIDENT
PAZ ZAMORA CONCLUDED HIS MESSAGE TO THE NATION IN WHICH HE EXPLAINED THE
GUIDELINES OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL
IMPLEMENT BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993.

   ROBERTO BARBERY, INTERIOR MINISTRY INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR, HAS

   THE SECOND ATTACK OCCURRED AT 2335 [0335 GMT ON 12 JANUARY], JUST AFTER
THE CABINET MEMBERS HAD LEFT GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD LISTENED TO THE
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.

   A BOMB WAS PLACED OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT HOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT THAT IS USED
BY CABINET MINISTERS.  THE POLICE PLACED THE BOMB IN A NEARBY FLOWER BED,
WHERE IT WENT OFF.  THE SHOCK WAVE SHATTERED SOME WINDOWS IN GOVERNMENT
HOUSE AND STREET LAMPS IN THE PLAZA MURILLO.

PERLA] [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO HAS DESCRIBED
THE POSSIBLE RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
REBELS AS POSITIVE.

   MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
SHOULD NOT CLAIM CREDIT FOR THE RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE BECAUSE IT WAS
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESUMING THE TALKS.
MERINO ADDED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ABANDON THE DELAYING AND IRRESPONSIBLE
TACTICS REGARDING THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY BOTH IN
THE MILITARY SENSE AND IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY IN ALL OF ITS
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MILITARY ACTIONS.  THE ONLY VALID ALTERNATIVE TO
PACIFY THE COUNTRY IS FOR THE REBELS TO STOP HOSTILITIES, VIOLENCE, AND
TERRORISM.  WE SHOULD JOINTLY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR JOINING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  [END RECORDING]

   HE ALSO SAID ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE FMLN IS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PARLIAMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] EL SALVADOR HAS PROPOSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY TO RATIFY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT PROTOCOL.  THIS WOULD
OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF THE SALVADORAN DELEGATES TO THE
PARLIAMENT.  IF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC WILLINGNESS BY THE FMLN EXISTS, THIS
COULD BE THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.  IT HAS NOT YET BEEN
DECIDED WHETHER THIS ELECTION WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE 1991 OFFICIAL
ELECTIONS FOR MAYORS AND DEPUTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN COULD
JOINTLY CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR.  THEN WE
COULD MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTIONS. [END
RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS, MERINO SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS
FAMILIAR WITH THE REBELS' TACTICS, PARTICULARLY WHEN TALKS ARE BEING
CONSIDERED.  HE ALSO SAID THE REBELS OPERATE IN CYCLES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER REACTED NAIVELY TO THE
FMLN TERRORISTS' STATEMENTS OR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  WE ARE
FULLY AWARE OF THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGIES.  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BEARS
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING HARMONY AND THE CITIZENS'S SECURITY.

LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR A NEW
DIALOGUE HAS APPEARED IN EL SALVADOR ONCE MORE, CREATING EXPECTATIONS, BOTH
HERE AND ABROAD.  THE COMING MEETING OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WITH UNITED
NATION'S REPRESENTATIVES, SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK, AND THE MEETING ON 12

OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS'
MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."

FINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO
MILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  ENDING THE YEAR, THE
WORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.

   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR
ADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI
HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE
JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT
THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE
ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.
THE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL
TELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.

   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000
PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN
ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN
CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS
MADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  

   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,
IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA
RICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE
NATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT
THE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.

   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE
IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN
$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR
ARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED
MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.
ADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN
HE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF
AID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.
IF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE
TIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.

   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON
THE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT
FOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A
DECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY
AROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO
DISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF
THE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE
AS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT
THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE
SALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS
BY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A
COMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.  WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A
MISTAKE.  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.

SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA,
WAS FOUND DEAD.

   OQUELI'S BODY WAS FOUND NEXT TO THE BODY OF GUATEMALAN POLITICIAN GILDA
FLORES, WHO WAS TAKING HIM TO THIS CITY'S AIRPORT SO THAT OQUELI COULD
TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA.

   SOLORZANO MARTINEZ TOLD NOTIMEX THAT , BECAUSE OF THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
OQUELI WAS IN GUATEMALA--LESS THAN 24 HOURS--THE ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT
THERE ARE GROUPS LINKED TO THE SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY SQUADRONS IN THE

   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE AND
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICA OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, IN
GUATEMALA ON 12 JANUARY, WE STATE:

   1. WE BLAME ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], THE REGIME OF
[PRESIDENT ALFREDO] CRISTIANI AND [ARENA LEADER ROBERTO] D'AUBUISSON, AND
ITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION.  THE LINKS BETWEEN
D'AUBUISSON'S ARENA PARTY AND THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF
MARIO SANDOVAL ARE WELL KNOWN.  BOTH OPPOSE EVERY EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO
THE REGION.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE
JESUITS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE MASTERMINDS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED, FORCES US TO
REVIEW OUR DIALOGUE OFFER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE
FASCIST REGIME WASH ITS FACE TO OBTAIN U.S. MILITARY AID AND TO PROCEED WITH
ITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION.

   3. THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE
EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES
THAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16
NOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
LATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.S. AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE
SLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS.

   4. AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A
PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THERE
CAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL
TRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES
ITSELF THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT A GENERAL REPRESSION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO STRUGGLE FOR ITS ABROGATION.

   5. THE 15 DECEMBER 1989 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION DEMANDING RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS MUST BE UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTED
IN OUR COUNTRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
(PSD) OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR
THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

   "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE
ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES.  THE MNR,
ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT [MPSC], MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION.

   THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI
AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED.  CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS
AFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO
SECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF
THE JESUITS.

   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE
MULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.  FROM THE
LIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE
CRIME.  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,
BUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO
GAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.  IN OUR VIEW, COL
BENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S.
CONGRESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE
PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
WE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT
ACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS
   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.
HE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE
FEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE
CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE
LA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.

   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF
THE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT
WAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST
FATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE
ASSASSINATION.  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND
EARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF
OPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE
OF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED
ELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.

   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR
COMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE
APPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT
OF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT
MILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.

   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE
LIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT
AN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN
THE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE
OF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO
VIERA.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS
HAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.

   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI
SAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND
SELF-DETERMINATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE NEW FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] PROPOSAL TO STOP FIGHTING PROVIDED THE U.S. CONGRESS
SUSPENDS AID TO EL SALVADOR IS BLACKMAIL.  WITH THIS, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS
SHOWING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE PLAIN TERRORISTS.

   THIS WAS SAID ON 12 JANUARY BY THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
PRESIDENT DR ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, WHO MAINTAINED THAT ASPIRATIONS OF THE
SUBSERSIVES ARE "DETESTABLE," AND, THEREFORE, CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.

   THE PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER SAID THAT WHILE IN EAST EUROPE THERE IS A
TRUE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION, THE FMLN MAINTAINS ITS POSITION OF TRYING TO
SUBDUE THE PEOPLE WITH A TOTALITARIAN PLAN THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  "HISTORY
HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND AND THEY (THE TERRORISTS) HAVE NOT NOTICED IT," HE
ADDED.

   CALDERON SOL EMPHASIZED THAT FMLN LEADERS SHOULD RECONSIDER THE POSITION
THEY HAVE MAINTAINED AND SHOULD RESPECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT
IT, NO NATION CAN ACHIEVE HARMONY AND DEVELOPMENT.

   THE SEDITIOUS "SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALONE AND THAT NO ONE
SUPPORTS THEIR ANARCHIC PLAN," THE ARENA PRESIDENT ADDED.  HE RECALLED THAT
DURING THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPORTED THE
ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT.

   CALDERON SOL STRESSED THAT THE FMLN MUST PROVIDE REAL PROOF THAT IT WANTS
TO REACH PEACE THROUGH NEGOTIATED MEANS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS GOOD
INTENTIONS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THROUGH TALKS.

   THE SUBVERSIVES MUST SUSPEND THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE WHILE THE FMLN AT THE SAME TIME IS PREPARING AN OFFENSIVE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY CONDEMNED TODAY THE ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST SALVADORAN LEADER
HECTOR OQUELI AND GUATEMALAN POLITICAL LEADER GILDA FLORES.

   BOTH BODIES WERE FOUND TODAY IN AN AREA NEAR GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR
BORDER AFTER THE VICTIMS WERE KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA CITY YESTERDAY.

   A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE "REGRETS AND CONDEMNS" THE ASSASSINATION OF
OQUELI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL FOR LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), A LEFTIST MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DEATHS OF TWO VALUABLE PERSONS, AND WE CONDEMN THIS
ACT OF VIOLENCE," THE NOTE ADDS.

   THE DOCUMENT IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE KIDNAPPING AND
ASSASSINATION OF BOTH LEADERS.

   GILDA FLORES WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD)
OF GUATEMALA, WHOSE SECRETARY GENERAL MARIO SOLORZANO REPORTED THAT
"SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO SOLORZANO, THE INCIDENT "SHOWS THERE IS COOPERATION BETWEEN
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF
OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM."

   THE BODIES OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS WERE FOUND EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE
BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR, OQUELI'S RELATIVES TOLD EFE IN EL SALVADOR.

   OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA LAST THURSDAY.  ON FRIDAY MORNING, WHILE ON
HIS WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO CATCH A PLANE TO NICARAGUA, HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY "HEAVILY ARMED MEN," ACCORDING TO THE MNR.

CARLOS MORALES SAID TODAY THAT A "FOREIGN COMMANDO" KILLED HECTOR OQUELI,
LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST PARTY NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MNR), AND GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER GILDA FLORES IN GUATEMALA.

   MORALES SAID AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS
THAT THE INTENTION OF THE "TERRORIST COMMANDO" WAS CAPTURING OQUELI ALIVE TO
TAKE HIM TO EL SALVADOR BUT THAT "SOMETHING MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR PLANS."

   MORALES STRESSED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE "FOREIGN COMMANDO," THE
NATIONALITY AND ORIGIN OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPECIFY, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR
MONTHS, ADDING THAT "IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS."

   MORALES SAID THAT THE GROUP HAS KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND HAS CARRIED OUT
VARIOUS BOMB ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA.  ASKED ABOUT A STATEMENT BY SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER MARIO SOLORZANO, WHO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AND
GUATEMALAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OPERATE JOINTLY IN GUATEMALA, MORALES SAID
THAT "THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION."

   "WE CANNOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY THIS TERRORIST COMMANDO CAME FROM; HOWEVER, WE
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTER ITS ACTIVITIES IN OUR NATIONAL
TERRITORY," HE STRESSED.

   OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET THIS GROUP "DEFAME" GUATEMALA WITH ITS
ACTIVITIES.  THERE IS ALREADY A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECURITY FORCES IN
CHARGE OF LOCATING THE KILLERS OF OQUELI AND FLORES.

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE POLICE, THE KIDNAPPING
TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WHEN OQUELI AND FLORES WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN THIS CAPITAL.

   THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING, WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE
AIRPORT, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER CAR, WHOSE OCCUPANTS FORCED GILDA FLORES
OUT OF THE CAR WHILE OQUELI TRIED TO ESCAPE, MORALES SAID.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ARMANDO CALDERON SOL,
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), THE RULING
SALVADORAN PARTY, TODAY CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO ANY POSSIBLE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.

   "IT IS SOMETHING SO HORRENDOUS, SO MONSTROUS, THAT WE MUST INVESTIGATE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) STAGED
THIS ASSASSINATION TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT," CALDERON SOL SAID.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI IMPLICATED FOUR OFFICERS, INCLUDING
ONE COLONEL, AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE ASSASSINATION OF
SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY.

   ACCORDING TO CALDERON SOL, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "IS DUTYBOUND TO
UNCOVER THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS AND TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY LINK BETWEEN
THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED AND THE FMLN."

   "THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACTED ON THEIR OWN, TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT AND DISCREDIT IT.  IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AN ISOLATED ACT.
INVESTIGATIONS ARE POINTING TO SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY," THE PRESIDENT OF
THE RIGHTIST ARENA PARTY SAID.

   IN ADDITION, CALDERON SOL ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND
GUATEMALA TO CARRY OUT AN "EXHAUSTIVE" INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE
MURDER OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES "DOES NOT GO
UNPUNISHED."

   CALDERON NOTED THAT "OQUELI HAD CLEARLY RENOUNCED THE POSITION OF ARMED
STRUGGLE IN FAVOR OF A PROGRAM FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION."

   OQUELI COLINDRES, A SALVADORAN LEADER OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, WAS
FOUND DEAD ALONG WITH GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ON 13 JANUARY IN A TOWN IN SOUTHEASTERN GUATEMALA NEAR THE

   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO
ARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN
PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER
OF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES
THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?

   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING
SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS
PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON
JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES
OF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME
GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF
OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED
AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON
IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.
WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,
WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE
OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE
INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL
RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE
WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE
INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY
INDEPENDENT.

   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY
SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING
VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING
EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN
ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS
THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT
THIS STAGE...

   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.

   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF
DEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST
DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.

   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH
MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH
INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS
WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT
ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT
GOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS
RELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT
AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'
DEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE
MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?

   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A
ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT
WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH
PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN
MAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS
BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE
BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN
THE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS
HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE
LOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT
EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS
DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY
THE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE
FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE
AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL
BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION
ALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE
REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON
CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS
ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ
MARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO
THE CRIME PROBLEM.

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE
COUNTRY.

   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE
AUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.

   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?

   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.

   LA PAZ, 24 DEC 88 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A CLAIM MADE BY THE MINISTER OF
INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE, JUAN CARLOS DURAN, 1988 WAS A "POSITIVE
YEAR," BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO SCORE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA AS WELL AS IN DEFENSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM EXISTING IN BOLIVIA.

   THE MINISTER REMARKED:  "I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A YEAR OF FULL
ACCOMPLISHMENT, A VERY POSITIVE AND VERY GOOD YEAR"; HE ADDED THAT THE
MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR REPRESENTED PROGRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
IN STATE ADMINISTRATION TASKS.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT GREATER CONSOLIDATION WAS ACHIEVED IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EFFORTS INTENDED TO REINFORCE BOLIVIA'S
POLITICAL SYSTEM TO BE WELL AIMED.

   HE CLAIMED THAT A SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ONE IN FORCE IN OUR NATION HAS
ENABLED THE CITIZENS TO ENJOY "ABSOLUTE FREEDOM," SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
UNDERSCORED NOT ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT IN THE NATIONS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
AS WELL.

   HE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HAD TO RESORT TO ANY UNUSUAL
ACTION TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  HE RECALLED MARTIAL LAW HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED,
ATTESTING TO PROGRESS IN THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

   HE COMMENTED:  "BOLIVIA IS AN EXEMPLARY COUNTRY IN TERMS OF FREEDOM,"
STRESSING THE BENEFITS THIS NATION HAS EXPERIENCED BY HAVING A DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISAGREE EVEN WITH THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

   HE SAID THAT THE CITIZENS AS A WHOLE HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY FOR RIGHTS
TO BE RECOGNIZED AND OBLIGATIONS ACCEPTED.  FOR THIS REASON, HE CLAIMED,
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY IN THE
VARIOUS FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE FAR MORE VISIBLE
EFFECTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

DRUG TRAFFICKING

   WITH REGARD TO THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFIC, HE CITED THE WORK
PERFORMED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES TO BATTLE DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, ACCORDING
TO HIS ACCOUNT, DESTROYED HUNDRED OF COCAINE FACTORIES AND PROCESSING PITS,
IN ADDITION TO CONFISCATING DRUGS AND ARRESTING PERSONS LINKED WITH THEIR
PRODUCTION OR ILLICIT TRAFFICKING.

   HE DECLARED THAT, DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS,
BOLIVIA HAS MANAGED TO RESPOND TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND TO
FOSTER A CONSCIOUSNESS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE METHODS FOR COMBATING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.

ROBBERY

   THE MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT THE SANTA CRUZ POLICE HAD MOBILIZED IN A
"COMBING OPERATION," TO FIND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ROBBERY OF A CAR ON
THE TRACK OF THE EASTERN RAILROAD SYSTEM FROM WHICH 130,000 BOLIVIANOS,
INTENDED TO PAY CHRISTMAS BONUSES, WAS STOLEN.

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE WERE STILL COMPLYING WITH
INSTRUCTIONS TO ERADICATE THE CRIME THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON A LARGE
SCALE DURING RECENT MONTHS IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ, AND TO BENEFIT THE
EASTERN POPULATION WITH PROTECTION.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TAKING STATEMENTS FROM
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE SEEN THE HOLDUP MEN AT CLOSE RANGE, SO AS TO
CAPTURE THEM PROMPTLY.

ORLANDO LETELIER OVER TO AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF JURISTS.

   THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ, WHO
ADDED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THE SITUATION IN A SERIOUS

SPOKESMAN LAST MONDAY IN REFERRING TO THIS MATTER REPRESENT A DISTORTED AND
PARTIAL VIEW, REFLECTING THE DESIRE TO IMPOSE A POSITION DISREGARDING
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

COURTS ARE PROCESSING A ROGATORY LETTER SUBMITTED THROUGH NORMAL DIPLOMATIC
CHANNELS, HAVING TO DO WITH THE PROCEEDINGS BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED

PERSONS NEAR RIO BLANCO MUNICIPALITY, TOLIMA DEPARTMENT.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT CRISTOBAL PEREZ AND RUBEN DARIO RAMIREZ WERE SHOT TO

   SO FAR THIS YEAR, 12 MEMBERS OF THE UP, THE LARGEST LEFTIST POLITICAL
FORCE IN COLOMBIA, HAVE BEEN KILLED BY RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM THE AIRPORT ON SATURDAY NIGHT, BERNARDO
JARAMILLO RECEIVED ANOTHER DEATH THREAT OVER THE TELEPHONE.  TODAY,
FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE THREAT, THE AUTHORITIES
STEPPED UP SECURITY MEASURES FOR JARAMILLO.  AN ARMORED VEHICLE, 2 STATION

   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT ONLY BAD PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.
HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU QUITE HONESTLY THAT I WOULD BE MORE AFRAID IF I
HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  I AM DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN COLOMBIA
AND TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.

   [GUTIERREZ] DO YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING YOU ENOUGH
PROTECTION?

   [JARAMILLO] ONE THING IS THE DIRECT PROTECTION EFFICIENTLY PROVIDED BY
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, AND ANOTHER THING IS THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR ELIMINATING THESE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR DISMANTLING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS IS APPROPRIATE.

   [GUTIERREZ] WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME, DO YOU FEEL IT IS YOUR LAST DAY?

   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMIST; I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU
WILL DIE WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.  WHEN I WALK OUT OF MY HOME, I TAKE ALL
THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. [END RECORDING]

   JARAMILLO SAID HIS TWO SONS, WHO DO NOT LIVE IN BOGOTA, CALLED TO SAY

AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE
VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD
LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF
CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR
NOT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO
FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED
BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,
AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY
DETERMINED. [END RECORDING]

   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW
HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS
JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY
CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST
MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON
FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END
RECORDING]

   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR
ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN
UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.

   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,
INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE
MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT
MUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE
EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA
SAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF
THE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO.

   IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION,
DR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.  DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION
HAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS.  HE
ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF "OPERATION
PINEAPPLE" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE
MASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] THERE IS NO DOUBT.  ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE
MASTERMIND.  THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT.  HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY
IMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT.  THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA] HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS
NOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. [END
RECORDING]

   DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS
ON THE CASE.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.  I THINK THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE
INVOLVED.  SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES
HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO
THE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP.  THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND
DECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT.  BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE
THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS.  MANY
PERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN
RESPECTABLE IN QUOTES.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH
1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS
BECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF
THE MURDER.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS
SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN
CLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE
LOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.

DECLARED A STATE OF MAXIMUM ALERT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN VIEW OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUBVERSIVE ATTACKS ON POLICE STATIONS, A SPOKESMAN FOR THAT

ALERT.  YESTERDAY, PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT AS USUAL IN SOUTHERN
TEGUCIGALPA, WHERE SOME ARMY COMBAT UNITS ARE HEADQUARTERED.

   THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DECLARED THE STATE OF ALERT AS A RESULT OF A WAVE
OF VIOLENCE THAT BEGAN WITH THE KILLING OF THREE PEOPLE IN JANUARY.

SHOT TO DEATH IN NORTHERN TEGUCIGALPA ON 7 JANUARY, AND ATTORNEY CARLOS
LORENZANA, WHO DEFENDED JUAN RAMON MATTA IN HONDURAS, WAS SHOT TO DEATH

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE TWO HELICOPTERS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY

HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY DAMAGE.

   [REPORTER] HAVE THE HELICOPTERS BEEN DOWNED?

   SAN SALVADOR, 11 MAR 89 (AFP) -- [REPORT] [AFP SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT ARTURO GUDINO] [TEXT] ALFREDO CRISTIANI, PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE OF THE SALVADORAN NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA),
WARNED TODAY THAT HE IS NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IF HE WINS THE UPCOMING 19
MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   CRISTIANI SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO TALK BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE ANY
PLATFORM."  CRISTIANI WARNED THAT IF THE REBELS DO NOT LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS AND JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, "THE BEST THING FOR
THEM TO DO IS TO LEAVE FOR NICARAGUA OR CUBA."

   AS SOMEONE WHO IS CONSIDERED CERTAIN TO BECOME THE NEXT SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT, CRISTIANI RECEIVED AN OVATION FROM A CHEERING CROWD THAT
GATHERED AT LA LIBERTAD SQUARE IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE ARENA HELD ITS
LAST MAJOR DEMONSTRATION IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ADDED: "WE WILL NEVER LET THEM ATTAIN POWER BY MEANS OF
RIFLES."

   THE ARENA CANDIDATE, WHO IS FAVORED TO WIN THE SALVADORAN
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, ASSERTED THAT ONCE HE ATTAINS POWER, HE WILL
GIVE FULL SUPPORT TO THE ARMY AND THE SECURITY FORCES "SO THEY CAN PUT
AN END TO THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY."

   CRISTIANI, A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN, ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IF HE WINS
THE ELECTIONS HE WILL PUT AN END TO THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKING
SECTOR AND FOREIGN TRADE ACTIVITIES, THE MAIN PILLARS OF A PLAN WHOSE
IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN AFTER THE COUNTRY'S 1979 COUP D'ETAT.  PRESIDENT
DUARTE KEPT THIS PLAN ALIVE AND THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROGRAM INTACT
DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL TERM.

   "WE WILL DO AWAY WITH INCAFE (NATIONAL COFFEE INSTITUTE), WHICH HAS
STOLEN JOBS FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORAN PRODUCERS," THE
ARENA LEADER SAID, ADDING: "WE DO NOT WANT A BANKING OR A BUSINESS
GOVERNMENT."

   CRISTIANI, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE CURRENT AGRARIAN REFORM,
THROUGH WHICH YOUNG MILITARY MEN WHO LED THE 1979 COUP D'ETAT INTENDED
TO BREAK THE BACK OF THE OLIGARCHY.

   THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS, MOSTLY FROM THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES,
MARCHED ALONG THE MAIN SAN SALVADOR STREETS TODAY TO LA LIBERTAD
SQUARE, WHICH WAS FILLED WITH ARENA POSTERS AND RED, WHITE, AND BLUE
ARENA FLAGS.

   ARENA'S CRISTIANI SAID: "WE WILL ELIMINATE THE UNEMPLOYMENT
PROBLEM.  WE WILL BUILD ROADS AND INCREASE PRODUCTION.  WE WILL PROVIDE
THE MOST NEEDY WITH HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND ALL OTHER SERVICES."

   MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF YOUTHS CHEERED FOR CRISTIANI AND DANCED IN
LA LIBERTAD SQUARE TO SONGS RIDICULING ARENA'S MAIN OPPOSITION IN THE
ELECTIONS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN
POWER.

   ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ARENA FOUNDER AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HE ACCUSED OF SPONSORING
THE PDC.

   D'AUBUISSON, WHOM THE PDC HAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE "BRAINS BEHIND"
THE MARCH 1980 ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, SAID:
"WHETHER THE WHITE BLONDS [CHELES] LIKE IT OR NOT, WE WILL WIN THE
ELECTIONS 10 YEARS AFTER THE 1979 FATAL COUP D'ETAT."

   D'AUBUISSON HARSHLY ATTACKED PRESIDENT DUARTE, WHO IS SUFFERING
FROM TERMINAL CANCER, AND REFERRED TO HIM AS "THE CRAZY AND WORN OUT
DUARTE."

   CRISTIANI IS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE FMLN, BUT ONLY WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW.  D'AUBUISSON SAID: "WE WILL
GIVE THEM TIME TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, LITTLE BY
LITTLE."

   ARENA'S MEETING, WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS ORGANIZERS DREW A CROWD OF
40,000 SUPPORTERS, ENDED WITHOUT INCIDENT TONIGHT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS TODAY THREATENED TO MURDER INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE 19
MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IF THEY DO NOT RESIGN FROM THEIR POSTS.

   "ALL INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE 19 MARCH
ELECTORAL FARCE WILL BE MERCILESSLY PUNISHED BY THE PEOPLE'S JUSTICE
FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR," THE GUERRILLAS
WARNED TODAY IN A MESSAGE BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS, THEIR
OFFICIAL RADIO STATION.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IS OPPOSED TO
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND HAS ASKED THE PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE OR TO
DESTROY THEIR BALLOTS.

   THE GUERRILLA THREAT IS AIMED AT MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENTAL AND
MUNICIPAL BALLOT-RECEIVING BOARDS, MAYORS, JUDGES, PARTY DIRECTORATES,
AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE OFFICIALS.

   THE WARNING ALSO APPLIES TO THE OWNERS OF VEHICLES THAT OPERATE
DURING AN IDEFINITE TRANSPORTATION STRIKE THE FMLN IS SCHEDULED TO
INITIATE ON 16 MARCH AT 0000.

   SWEARING IN APPROXIMATELY 20 BALLOT-RECEIVING BOARDS IN SAN
SALVADOR, RICARDO PERDOMO, PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL,
SAID THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNCIL ARE PREPARED TO GUARANTEE NORMAL
ELECTIONS.

   "WE WERE EXPECTING THIS.  WE KNOW THE GUERRILLAS WILL IMPLEMENT ALL
TYPES OF BOYCOTTS TO HINDER THE ELECTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE IN A
POSITION TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS," PERDOMO REITERATED.

   MILITARY UNITS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SINCE YESTERDAY IN CITIES IN THE
EASTERN DEPARTMENTS OF MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND LA UNION,
WHERE THE REBELS PERSISTENTLY SABOTAGE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

   THE FMLN HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL INTENSIFY ITS "INSURRECTIONAL
ACTIONS" THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE NATION'S
ELECTRICAL AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS ON ELECTION DAY.

   THE GUERRILLAS ARE OPPOSED TO THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY
ARE "PART OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN AND A MEANS OF LEGITIMIZING
THE CONTINUATION OF WAR, HUNGER, AND POVERTY."

   "THOSE WHO COOPERATE WITH THE ELECTORAL FARCE WILL BE THROWN OUT OF
THEIR HOMES, EXECUTED, AND THEIR PROPERTIES WILL BE SABOTAGED BEFORE,
DURING, AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS," THE REBELS SAID.

   THE GUERRILLAS SENT MESSAGES ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO THE MAYORS AND
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS OF EIGHT TOWNS IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT, DEMANDING
THAT THEY RESIGN OR THE FMLN WILL "BRING TO BEAR" AGAINST THEM "THE
ENTIRE WEIGHT OF POPULAR JUSTICE."

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON YESTERDAY
STATED:  "I HAVE WITHSTOOD THE LOWEST SLANDER FOR 8 YEARS.  GOD ALMIGHTY
AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT REPUDIATED MURDER.

   "EVERY TIME THERE ARE ELECTIONS, WE HEAR THE SAME RUMORS THAT THERE IS
EVIDENCE ABOUT MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S CASE AND THAT IT WILL BE
PRESENTED.  THUS, A GREAT SHOW IS PRESENTED, BUT ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE
OVER NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT MARTYR OF THE CHURCH.

   "DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT, SUPPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PDC,
RESORTS TO VILE DEFAMATION, SLANDER, AND LIES AGAINST ITS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS BECAUSE IT CANNOT HIDE ITS CORRUPTION."

   THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA,
DEPUTY TO REJECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, "IN A NATIONAL
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK," THAT IMPLICATED D'AUBUISSON "IN MSGR OSCAR
ARNULFO ROMERO'S DEATH."

   "I AM SORRY I DID NOT SEE THE BROADCAST, BUT OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON
IT.  I CAN VERY WELL IMAGINE ALL THE DESPICABLE THINGS THAT WERE
IRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR
ROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.  IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S
PROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL," D'AUBUISSON SAID.

   "THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER
ME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC
HAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS
CORRUPTION."

   D'AUBUISSON ADDED:  THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' "LIE" IS AIMED AT
DECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS.  THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE,
BECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY.

   THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS.  THE PDC CONTROLLED THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN MSGR ROMERO WAS KILLED.  THE CRUCIAL
QUESTION IS:  WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE
AT THE TIME?  WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM IT HAS THE EVIDENCE YET FAILS
TO PRESENT IT?  AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME
OF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH!  THIS ENTIRE
ATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED.

   HE ASSERTED:  I AM AWARE OF THE PDC'S INCREDIBLE PLOT TO SLANDER ME,
BUT THE PDC ONLY SAYS WHAT IS CONVENIENT.  IT IS A DIRTY GAME BUT GOD IS
MY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT
CRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS.  THE PDC CANNOT
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO "ARE
GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE [REFERENCE TO THE PDC'S PARTY COLORS] BUT RED ON THE
INSIDE."  HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING LIKE A GOOD SALVADORAN SO THE
"TURNCOATS" DO NOT BETRAY US, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, MAJOR ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON ARRIETA EMPHASIZED.

REPEAT: WE CALL ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE 19
MARCH ELECTIONS AND DEMAND THAT THEY PUBLICLY RESIGN.  THE 19 MARCH

   ARENA AND THE PDC REFUSED TO ACCEPT OUR PEACE PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE
ELECTIONS A TOOL FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  THEREFORE, THE
FEELING OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE IS ONE OF REJECTION OF THE 19

ATTACKED A U.S. CONVOY WITH M-16 RIFLE-FIRE," THE LEAFLETS READ.  CARCOMO
WAS A HONDURAN LEFT-WING AUTHOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

   THE FPM, NAMED AFTER A CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADER OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR SEVERAL GUERRILLA ATTACKS IN THE PAST.

   HONDURAS HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY A WAVE OF VIOLENCE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THE
ASSASSINATIONS OF A FORMER ARMED FORCES COMMANDER, A COMMANDER OF THE
ANTI-SANDINIST REBELS (SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES), AND A LAWYER OF AN
ALLEGED DRUG TRAFFICKING TSAR.

   PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HAS CALLED FOR NATIONAL DIALOGUE STARTING THIS
WEEK WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS,
BUSINESSMEN, AND OTHER GROUPS TO TRY TO CURB THE SUDDEN SURGE OF VIOLENCE.

   HONDURAS, A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY
IN A REGION STRICKEN BY INTERNAL CONFLICTS.

TEGUCIGALPA OF MANUEL RUGAMA, KNOWN AS COMMANDER AURELIANO, THE SECOND IN
COMMAND OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES IN HONDURAS.

   HONDURAN NATIONAL POLICE ON MONDAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS HONDURAN JUAN
BAUTISTA NUNEZ AMADOR AND NICARAGUAN LUIS FERNANDO ORDONEZ REYES, WHO TOLD
REPORTERS THAT COMMANDER AURELIANO WAS ASSASSINATED ON ORDERS FROM JOSE DE
JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY CHIEF OF SECURITY.

   MERCEDES BORGE, PRESS DIRECTOR AT THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, SAID
THERE IS NO JOSE DE JESUS PENA EMPLOYED AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA AND THAT AURELIANO'S ASSASSINATION WAS PERPETRATED BY THREE
INDIVIDUALS AND NOT TWO, AS THE HONDURAN POLICE CLAIM.  BORGE SAID THAT
WHILE NICARAGUA MAKES SERIOUS AND FORMAL PROPOSALS TO ADVANCE PEACE
EFFORTS, IT IS WORRISOME THAT HONDURAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CREATING
SITUATIONS THAT COULD UNLEASH CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THERE
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TWO ATTACKS ON THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA,
BORGE SAID.  SHE ADDED THAT THE HONDURAN POLICE REPORT CONFLICTS WITH THE
AUTOPSY REPORT, BECAUSE IN HIS STATEMENT, NUNEZ AMADOR REFERRED TO ONLY A
.38-CALIBER REVOLVER AND A .45-CALIBER PISTOL, WHICH WERE NOT FOUND ON
RUGAMA'S BODY OR IN HIS VEHICLE.

   BOGOTA, 8 FEB 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
RESHUFFLED HIS CABINET TODAY, APPOINTING FIVE NEW MINISTERS AND
RECONFIRMING EIGHT FOR THE FINAL PHASE OF HIS TERM, ACCORDING TO AN
OFFICIAL DECREE.

   THE REORGANIZATION OCCURRED AFTER THE MINISTERS PRESENTED A PROTOCOL
RESIGNATION TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT NEW MINISTERS; SOME OF THEM
DID NOT WANT TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR A SEAT IN
CONGRESS IN THE 1990 ELECTIONS.

   THIS HAS BEEN THE THIRD IMPORTANT CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE BARCO TOOK
OFFICE IN AUGUST 1986.

   THE FIVE NEW CABINET MINISTERS INCLUDE TWO WOMEN WHO WILL HOLD THE
POSTS OF PUBLIC WORKS AND LABOR MINISTERS.  THE OTHERS WHO WILL JOIN THE
CABINET WERE APPOINTED TO THE GOVERNMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTH
MINISTRIES.

   THE OUTGOING MINISTERS STATED IN THEIR PROTOCOL LETTER OF RESIGNATION
THAT A CABINET RESHUFFLE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE
ITS GOALS IN THE FINAL STAGE OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION.

   "WE HAVE SERVED IN A A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT PERIOD OF NATIONAL LIFE,
CHARACTERIZED BY SITUATIONS OF CRIMINALITY AND TERRORISM," THE RESIGNATION
LETTER STATED.

   THE LETTER ADDED THAT THE RESIGNATION RESULTED FROM SOME OF THE
MINISTERS' NOT WANTING TO BE POLITICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR
PUBLIC POSTS.  COLOMBIAN LAW DEMANDS THAT THOSE ASPIRING TO PUBLIC POSTS
MUST NOT HAVE SERVED AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

   LIMA, 6 FEB 89 -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS BY
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPT] [REPORTER] ...TO AN ARRESTED LEADER OF
THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE WITH THAT GROUP?

   [GARCIA] THINGS SHOULD BE PROPERLY CLARIFIED BECAUSE ONE SHOULD NOT BE
INFLUENCED BY REPORTS OR ANECDOTES.  THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL FACT:  A HARD
BLOW HAS BEEN DEALT TO SUBVERSION WITH THE ARREST OF ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL
CHIEFTAINS--NOT A LEADER BUT A CHIEFTAIN.  PERU HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF
BLOODY TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSIONS FOR TERRORISTS OTHER
THAN THOSE GRANTED BY THE LAW.  THIS FACT CANNOT BE DISPELLED BY AN
ANECDOTE LIKE THE ONE I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY.  THE ESSENTIAL FACT
IS THAT THIS ARREST [OF VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS] IS A MAJOR BLOW TO
SUBVERSION.  IT WAS NOT MERELY GOOD LUCK, BUT IT WAS THE RESULT OF WORK
AND FOLLOW-UP BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
POLICE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE KEY POINT.  I HAVE SEEN THAT ATTENTION HAS
BEEN GIVEN TO A VISIT [PAID BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO POLAY
CAMPOS IN PRISON] WHICH WAS NEITHER A COURTESY VISIT NOR AN EXPRESSION OF
SUPPORT, BUT JUST A SUPERVISORY ACT, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FACTS.
ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT, WHICH FOR SURE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMENTED
ON BY SOME COMMUNIST POLITICIANS, WAS TO OBSERVE THE CONDITION OF THE
DETAINEE.  THE VISIT DID NOT MEAN THAT THE DETAINEE WAS GRANTED SPECIAL
STATUS.  WE DO NOT GRANT SPECIAL STATUS TO ANYONE, MUCH LESS TO THESE
MURDERERS WHO HAVE STAINED THE NATION WITH BLOOD.  THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE
LAW MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ON THESE INDIVIDUALS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE
VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO THE ANTITERRORIST
DIRECTORATE DOES NOT MEAN THAT A DIALOGUE HAS BEGUN OR THAT SOMEONE IS
BEING PRAISED, AS SOME ILL-INTENTIONED MASS MEDIA WILL PROBABLY SAY.

NOON WHEN A 39-MAN POLICE PATROL OF THE SANTA LUCIA DETACHMENT, REINFORCED
BY ANTI-NARCOTICS POLICE, SURROUNDED THE UCHIZA AIRPORT AND WAITED FOR THE
ARRIVAL OF TWO COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY CARRYING
DRUGS.  A TIP HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE POLICE.

   THE LANDING STRIP WAS SUBJECTED TO CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE.  A 60-MAN
ARMED GROUP OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS APPEARED AT 1620.  APPARENTLY, THIS GROUP
WAS GOING TO PROTECT THE COLOMBIAN LIGHT AIRPLANES.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRIVED ABOARD SEVERAL VEHICLES.  THEY DID NOT KNOW
THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY THE POLICE, WHOM THEY OUTNUMBERED.

   UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IMPLEMENTING A MASTERLY PLAN, THE POLICE
FORCES APPEARED AND A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT ENSUED.

   SURPRISED BY THE UNEXPECTED ATTACK, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RETURNED THE
FIRE, WHICH LASTED FOR 1/2 AN HOUR.

   AS A RESULT OF THE CLASH, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE KILLED AND FOUR WERE
INJURED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE CENTRAL HOSPITAL IN TINGO MARIA.  MEANWHILE,
15 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED; THE REST FLED.

   AFTER THE INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS, THE CAPTURED DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE
FULLY IDENTIFIED.  THE FOLLOWING COLOMBIAN CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED:  FLORIAN
CARVAJAL TELLO, MARIO MONTES MURILLO, AND ROLAND ARAMAYO DIAZ.  THE

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 22 MAR 89 -- [EXCERPT] THE FMLN GENERAL
COMMAND WILL SOON PRESENT A NEW PEACE PROPOSAL TO ARENA AND THEREFORE
CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF A BROAD COALITION TO FACE THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, A COALITION TO INCLUDE THE PDC, WHICH IS NOW AN OPPOSITION
PARTY AFTER HAVING LOST THE ELECTIONS.

   FMLN COMMANDERS ANA GUADUALUPE MARTINEZ, SALVADOR SAMAYOA, AND JOSE
MARIA LOPEZ READ THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE AND SAID THAT ARENA'S REACHING POWER
DEFINITELY "MEANS THAT THE OLIGARCHY WILL REJOIN THE MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP."

   THE COMMANDERS ALSO EVALUATED THE LAST 5 YEARS OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE DUARTE GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR:

   SALVADOR SAMAYOA SAID:  "THE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST
DIFFICULT.  THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WE ARE CLOSER
TO DEFINING THE CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAR.  THE ENEMY WAS ILL-DEFINED,
ENJOYING CERTAIN POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO
TRY AND PERSUADE THEM THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE WAS A TERRORIST WAR
WHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE."

   ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID:

   "I BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS THAT BEGAN IN 1981 ARE COMING FULL CIRCLE
NOW, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES.

   "THE PDC EMERGED FROM A POPULAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP.  NOW
THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION AND CAN DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION AS
EQUALS, AND THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.

   "THE SPLIT WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS FOR THE BETTER.  I BELIEVE WE
ARE NOW IN THE FINAL STAGES."

   WHEN MARTINEZ WAS ASKED HOW SHE WOULD DESCRIBE THE PDC'S ROLE IN EL
SALVADOR DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS, SHE REPLIED:

   "THE PDC PLAYED A VERY NEGATIVE ROLE.  IT PROLONGED THE WAR THAT WOULD
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN VERY MUCH SHORTER, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PDC MAY
DEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR AND PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN THE
OPPOSITION, FAVORING A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."

   THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVED THAT ARENA'S VICTORY WILL BRING BACK THE
DEATH SQUADS.  THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVE THAT NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF A
MILITARY COUP IS GREATER.

   CONTRARY TO WHAT MIGHT BE BELIEVED, THE FMLN COMANDERS SAID:  "WE DO
NOT SEE A STRONG RIGHT WING.  WE SEE THEM MORE TRAPPED POLITICALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY."  THE COMMANDERS ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FACE
THE SAME OLIGARCHY AND ARMY THEY FACED IN 1979.

   THE MESSAGE THEY HAVE FOR ARENA STATES:  "SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED?  IS IT
NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE LAUNCHED A MILITARY OFFENSIVE?"

   THE COMMANDERS SAID THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN IS READY FOR A GREAT
MILITARY EFFORT AND REITERATED THAT IF ANYTHING CLEARLY EMERGED DURING THE
LAST 2 MONTHS, IT IS THAT "WE ARE A POLITICAL MAJORITY IN EL SALVADOR."

CIRO LOPEZ, COMMANDER OF THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON, WHICH WAS ATTACKED
BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 13 SEPTEMBER, DENIED TODAY THAT THREE U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE CLASH WITH THE REBELS,
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE U.S. MEDIA AND PRESIDENT HAVE STATED.

   LOPEZ SAID THE "THREE ADVISERS DID NOT SHOOT, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
ARMED AND WERE IN A PILLBOX WITH A VIEW OF THE INSIDE PART OF THE
GARRISON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE MORTAR FIRE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE THREE ADVISERS "HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN ANY
FIGHTING" BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, "THEY WERE IN A SECURITY AREA
DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACK."

   THE INFORMATION THAT THE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD DIRECTLY
PARTICIPATED IN THE SHOOTING CAUSED BY THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS
CARRIED BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND CORROBORATED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN,
WHO AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD "FIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE."

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE WASHINGTON POST, THREE
U.S.  MILITARY ADVISERS RESPONDED TO THE REBEL FIRE AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN MILITARY INSTALLATION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   THE ARMY SUSTAINED 9 DEAD AND 12 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FMLN
GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON.

   A U.S. DIPLOMATIC SOURCE WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS STATED IN
THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL THAT "THE ADVISERS HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO PARTICIPATE
IN COMBAT OR ATTACK MISSIONS."

   IN HIS STATEMENTS, RONALD REAGAN SUPPORTED THE ACTION OF THE
MILITARY ADVISERS AND ADDED THAT "I HAVE NEVER SENT MY MEN TO FACE ANY
DANGER WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE
ATTACKED."

   IN MARCH 1987, DURING ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE GARRISON, U.S. SERGEANT
GREGORY FRONIUS, A MILITARY ADVISER, WAS KILLED.

   CURRENTLY, 55 OF THE 119 U.S. ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR ARE MILITARY

STATED THAT THE REBELS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE FARC 28TH FRONT, ATTACKED
TWO TRUCKS FILLED WITH SOLDIERS.

   THE SANTA RITA POLICE CHIEF FOUND THE BODIES OF A SOLDIER AND A REBEL

PEOPLE WERE KILLED, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY.  WE KNOW SEVEN
PEASANTS WERE MURDERED BY FARC 12TH FRONT MEMBERS."

   HELICOPTERS CONTINUE OVERFLYING THE BATTLE ZONE.  AIRBORNE TROOPS
REPLACED THE TROOPS WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEN UP IN ARMS.

   PEASANTS WHO ARRIVED AT SAN VICENTE CHUCURRI SAID POWERFUL EXPLOSIONS
HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HEARD SINCE THE MILITARY ACTIONS BEGAN ON 22 MARCH.

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DIEGO MONTANA, ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE
PATRIOTIC UNION [UP], TOLD EFE TODAY THAT ONLY THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNG) IN THE PEACE
TALKS COULD GUARANTEE A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN COLOMBIA.

   THE CNG GROUPS THE SIX MAIN LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS THAT
OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.  THERE ARE 20,000 GUERRILLAS IN 100 FRONTS THROUGHOUT
COLOMBIA.

   THE GROUPS COMPRISING THE CNG ARE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA (FARC, COMMUNIST); THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL, MAOIST);
CAMILISTA UNION-ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (UC-ELN, PRO-CASTROITE); THE
19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19, NATIONALIST LEFT); QUINTIN LAME MOVEMENT
(INDIGENIST); AND THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY (PRT, TROTSKYIST).

   TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE M-19, AND THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL
PARTIES WILL BEGIN IN BOGOTA ON 3 APRIL AS PART OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS BEGAN LAST JANUARY TO ACHIEVE
PEACE. 

   THE UP ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH THAT IT WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE
ROUNDTABLES, THE NAME GIVEN TO THE TALKS THAT WILL BEGIN NEXT MONDAY AND IN
WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS WILL DISCUSS THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLITICAL CRIMES
THAT HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   SINCE THE UP WAS FOUNDED, NEARLY 1,000 OF ITS MEMBERS AND LEADERS HAVE
BEEN MURDERED.

   THE "DIRTY WAR" AGAINST THE LEFT, PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, AND HUMAN
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAS RESULTED IN 700 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS SO FAR THIS
YEAR.

   THERE WERE 2,978 POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS IN 1988; 1,200 IN 1987; AND
1,000 IN 1986.

   IN ADDITION, NEARLY 1,500 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CLASHES BETWEEN THE
ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN 1988.  SO FAR THIS YEAR, ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN CLASHES.

   DIEGO MONTANA TOLD EFE THAT HE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE M-19 HAD
INITIATED PEACE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT HE NOTED THAT THE REST OF
THE CNG ACCOUNTS FOR 84 PERCENT OF THE REBELS. 

   "I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING TALKS WITH 16
PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLAS," MONTANA SAID, "BUT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL NOT
BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE OTHER 84 PERCENT OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS KEEP ON
FIGHTING."

   MONTANA ALSO PRAISED THE LATEST COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE CNG, WHICH WAS
SIGNED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, AND THE UC-ELN, WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR DECISION
TO BEGIN TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT WHICH LINKED THEIR PARTICIPATION TO
THE DISMANTLING OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   MOREOVER, JACOBO ARENAS, COMMANDER OF THE FARC AND MEMBER OF THE CNG
STAFF, TOLD BOGOTA EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK THAT "ANYTHING LEADING TO THE
OPENING OF ROADS, THE BUILDING OF BRIDGES, AND THE OPENING OF LOCKS IS
BENEFICIAL," AND HE PRAISED THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19
IN THAT REGARD.

   ARENAS, HOWEVER, SAID THE M-19 HAD PULLED ITSELF OUT OF THE CNG BY
REACHING A PEACE AGREEMENT ON ITS OWN AND THAT IN THE NEXT PLENARY MEETING
THE POSSIBLE EXPULSION OF THE M-19 FROM THE CNG WOULD BE STUDIED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID POSITIVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED DURING
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA.  ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
CRISTIANI SAID, IS THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL
TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL
TALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND TO BRIEF THEM ON THE PEACE
PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE, AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
PEACE PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENTS RECEIVED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ON THE PEACE
PLAN AND ON THE RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FROM THIS PROCESS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  I BELIEVE WE HAVE RECEIVED GREAT SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE
PROCESS.  AS A COUNTRY, EL SALVADOR HAS RECEIVED THE LATIN AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS' SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE SUPPORT OF THE
SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM WE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD
BILATERAL TALKS. [END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE COFFEE PROBLEM, CRISTIANI SAID THE PRESIDENTS NOTED THE
NEED FOR REACHING AGREEMENTS ON THE COFFEE PACT AND THE PRICE OF COFFEE.
HE ADDED THAT DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT HE CONDEMNED, IN THE PRESENCE
OF ALL PRESIDENTS, THE AID NICARAGUA GIVES TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI STATED.

   CONCERNING THE RECENT ATTACKS BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS, PARTICULARLY
THE 30 OCTOBER ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND, CRISTIANI SAID THIS IS
REGRETTABLE BECAUSE CIVILIANS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY SUCH ATTACKS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THIS INCIDENT TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN
THE FMLN IS TRYING TO SHOW ITS STRENGTH.  THE FMLN IS ALSO TRYING TO
PROVOKE SOME REACTION FROM THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THE ARMY, IN A GIVEN
MOMENT, EXERTS PRESSURE TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  I THINK THIS IS
THE REASON FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI ADDED THAT SUCH ATTITUDES WILL NOT HINDER THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS IN VENEZUELA.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL WILL BE THE
SAME PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN COSTA RICA AND IT WILL BE FULLY DISCUSSED.
HOWEVER, THE PRIORITY WILL ALWAYS BE THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.

THE KILLING OF 10 LABOR UNION MEMBERS AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS ON

FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO,
ALIAS FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [REPORTER] COMRADE SANCHO, WHY HAS THE FMLN DECIDED NOT TO
ATTEND THE CARACAS MEETING?

   [SANCHO] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND INSTRUCTED ME THIS AFTERNOON TO
ANNOUNCE TO THE NATION A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH WE DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE
CARACAS MEETING AND DIALOGUE.  THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE RECENT FENASTRAS
MASSACRE, WHICH WE BELIEVE CANNOT BE IGNORED.  THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER
ATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW
POLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN
MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE
NEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI,
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF
MASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES.  THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED.  WE
DO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED.  THE STATE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAVE
TO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE.  THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS
NOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON
THE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL
PLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE [WORDS INDISTINCT]
FENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER.  MORE THAN 30 OF
THEM WERE DETAINED.  WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A
COMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL
CEMETERY.  WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE
DOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
SITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?

   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION
OF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION
WITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES [WORDS INDISTINCT]
BEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A
MINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR
MOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE
PROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT
THE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.

   [REPORTER] WITH LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE
ARENA [NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO
POSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?

   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND
THE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,
AS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.
THE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH
TO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE
OPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY
TAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE
SURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE
RIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING
GREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.

   [REPORTER] THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT
IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD
IN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,
ESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?

   [SANCHO] ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO
FENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST
CONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE
CREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,
THEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.

   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL
GRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS
SAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE
ELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN
THE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT
THIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS
BEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN
INTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY [WORDS INDISTINCT]

ORGANIZATION OF LABOR UNIONS, ASSOCIATIONS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS TODAY
REGRETTED THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' DECISION TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS NOT "IRREVOCABLE."

   REVERAND EDGAR PALACIOS, THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH
AND COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE FOR
PEACE, COMPRISING ABOUT 65 ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD THE PRESS ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION IT WANTS PEACE.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) GENERAL COMMAND
ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE ON 2 NOVEMBER THAT IT HAD CANCELED ANOTHER ROUND
OF THE DIALOGUE SCHEDULED FOR 20-21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WHICH
WERE TO CONTINUE TALKS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER TO END A 10-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

   THE REBELS CLAIMED AN INTENSIFICATION OF REPRESSION AND BLAMED THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF 10 UNION MEMBERS IN A
DYNAMITE ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR ON 31 OCTOBER AND FOR OTHER ATTACKS ON
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS.

   GUILLERMO ROJAS, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN WORKERS
(UNTS), THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOR UNION, TERMED THE DIALOGUE SUSPENSION AS
"LOGICAL."  ROJAS SAID CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN NO INDICATIONS HE INDEED WANTS
PEACE; QUITE THE CONTRARY, HE HAS "DECLARED WAR ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY
ORDERING ATTACKS ON LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS."

   MEANWHILE, ARONETTE DIAZ, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST NATIONALIST
DEMOCRATIC UNION (UDN), SAID THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
WORRISOME BECAUSE "IT CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE VIOLENCE THAN IT IS ALREADY
ENDURING."

   "THE ONLY THING LEFT IS FOR TANKS TO BE DEPLOYED TO MACHINEGUN ALL OF

LABOR UNIONS IN EL SALVADOR TODAY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE GUERRILLAS'
DECISION TO SUSPEND DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT COMMITS ITSELF TO
GUARANTEEING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER DYNAMITE ATTACK THAT LEFT 10 DEAD
AND 30 WOUNDED, AND ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH PROVIDE "GUARANTEES FOR THE OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) DECISION COINCIDED
WITH THE BURIAL OF THE 10 UNION LEADERS KILLED IN THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
(FENASTRAS).

   IN A COMMUNIQUE THE FMLN INSISTED THAT THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST
FENASTRAS "WAS PLANNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, APPROVED BY THE
PRESIDENT (ALFREDO CRISTIANI), AND CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTES."

   IN THE COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE COMMANDERS, THE FMLN ADDED
THAT "WE MUST PREVENT OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS SLAUGHTER."

   HUMBERTO CENTENO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS
(UNTS), WHICH CLAIMS TO HAVE A MEMBERSHIP OF 200,000 PERSONS, SAID THAT
"THIS IS A LOGICAL AND CORRECT DECISION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS
DECLARED WAR ON THE WORKERS AND NOT ON THE FMLN."

   ORLANDO AREVALO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PEASANT WORKERS UNITY--OF A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC TREND--WONDERED IF IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WHILE "THE
PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED."

   POLITICAL LEADERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEANINGS
VOICED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE TALKS AND COMMITTED
THEMSELVES TO CONTACTING THE FMLN LEADERS TO MAKE THEM RECONSIDER NOT
ATTENDING THE THIRD ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS SLATED FOR 20 AND 21
NOVEMBER IN CARACAS (VENEZUELA).

   EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL
DIALOGUE (CPDN), REGRETTED THE FMLN'S DECISION AND WARNED THAT "WHEN THE
DOORS TO DIALOGUE ARE CLOSED, THE DOORS TO WAR ARE OPENED."

   SEVERAL OPPOSITION LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE TALKS
WILL WORSEN THE WAR AND WILL BRING MORE BLOODSHED, BUT HIS OPINION WAS NOT
SHARED BY THE WORKERS, WHO STATED THEY ARE "VICTIMS OF AN OPEN WAR BY THE
GOVERNMENT."

   CENTENO ADDED:  "WHAT MORE WILL HAPPEN?  THE ONLY THING MISSING IS FOR
THE TANKS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREETS AGAINST US.  WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, AND
WE--THE WORKERS--HAVE NOT MURDERED ANYONE.  WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
POLITICAL DEBATES AND DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS."

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN BEGAN A DIALOGUE IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO.
IN THE FIRST MEETING, THEY AGREED TO MEET IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER TO
DRAFT A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL END AN INTERNAL WAR THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000
DEAD IN 9 YEARS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 NOV 89 -- [TEXT] COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS,
COMMANDER OF THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE, REPORTED ON 31 OCTOBER THAT BETWEEN
JANUARY AND SEPTEMBER, THE ARMY HAD INFLICTED 800 CASUALTIES ON THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AND SEIZED 300 WEAPONS IN THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY.  COL VARGAS ADDED THAT THE ARMY SUFFERED 443
CASUALTIES DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE AREA
ADDED THAT 393 GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND 310 WOUNDED IN MORE THAN 600
CLASHES AND THAT 143 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 300 WOUNDED.

   "QUALITATIVE CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE SINCE
1984, WHEN THE FMLN CHANGED ITS OVERALL STRATEGY FROM SEIZING POWER BY
MILITARY MEANS TO THE EXTENDED PEOPLE'S WAR WHOSE BASIC ELEMENT IS THE
UPRISING OF THE MASSES," COL VARGAS SAID.

   VARGAS ADDED THAT DESPITE REBEL ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED
OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS AND ARE PROMOTING THE "EASTERN 89" PLAN IN 18
MUNICIPALITIES WITH 40 MILLION COLONS TO COVER THE COLLECTIVE AND
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE.  THEY ARE PREPARING A SECOND PHASE OF THE
PLAN, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE OTHER THREE DEPARTMENTS.

   VARGAS ALSO REPORTED THAT, BECAUSE 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S COFFEE IS
GROWN IN THE EASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE ARMY IS CARRYING OUT
COMBING OPERATIONS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA DURING THE COFFEE
HARVEST.

   REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT - FMLN DIALOGUE HELD IN COSTA RICA, WHICH HE
ATTENDED AS ADVISOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, VARGAS SAID THE ARMED
FORCES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE.  "THERE IS
SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE AND PEACE.  WE REJECT ALL
CHARGES OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ATTACKS AND
PUBLICLY REITERATE OUR TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY'S PEACE PROCESS,"
VARGAS ADDED.

   QUITO, 8 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE ECUADORAN INSURGENT GROUP "FREE
HOMELAND MONTONEROS" (MPL) TODAY REITERATED THAT IT WILL NOT ABANDON
ITS ARMED STRUGGLE.  IT MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 1 DAY AFTER THE "ALFARO
LIVES, DAMNIT" (AVC) GROUP SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT
RODRIGO BORJA'S GOVERNMENT.

   THE MPL TODAY EXPRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE ITS ARMED
STRUGGLE AND NOT TO FOLLOW THE AVC'S FOOTSTEPS.  AVC LEADERS AND TWO
ECUADORAN MINISTERS YESTERDAY APPEARED BEFORE THE MEDIA TO FORMALIZE
THE PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AVC AND THE GOVERNMENT.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TO EFE, THE MPL STATES THAT IT WILL NOW
BRANDISH ITS WEAPONS "WITH GREATER FORCE TO ATTAIN FREEDOM FOR
ECUADORAN SOCIETY AND ITS PEOPLE."

   THE MPL COMMUNIQUE CALLS UPON ECUADOREANS "TO STRENGTHEN THE
PEOPLE'S POWER, TO PREPARE TO SEIZE POLITICAL POWER THROUGH
ORGANIZATION AND STRUGGLE UNTIL THE BOURGEOISIE AND IMPERIALISM ARE
DEFEATED, AND TO PROMOTE REVOLUTIONARY UNITY IN THE STREETS, FIELDS,
AND MOUNTAINS."

   THE MPL ACCUSES THE BORJA ADMINISTRATION OF ADDING TO THE PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS BY AUTHORIZING NEW INCREASES FOR BASIC STAPLES AND BY
"CONTINUING TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS."

   ACCORDING TO THE MPL, THERE HAVE BEEN 4 MURDERS, 9 CASES OF
TORTURE, 8 CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES, AND 25 ARBITRARY ARRESTS SINCE
BORJA ROSE TO POWER LAST 10 AUGUST.  MEANWHILE, THE GROUP ADDED, "THE
ACTIONS OF PARAMILITARY SQUADS CONTINUE WITH IMPUNITY."

   THE GROUP, WHICH BECAME ACTIVE ON 22 JANUARY 1986, SAID IT IS VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT "THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL LEFT WING,
WHICH CANNOT SURMOUNT THE PARLIAMENTARY LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE SYSTEM."

   LIMA, 9 MAR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAID HERE TODAY THAT HE
SUPPORTS THE CONSTRUCTION "OF NOT ONE BUT FIVE" INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAYS
IN THE AMAZONIAN REGION.

   ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE UNITED STATES PRESSURED JAPAN NOT
TO PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE BRAZILIAN-PERUVIAN PROJECT.

   GARCIA SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAD
HELD TALKS WITH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AT HIROHITO'S FUNERAL TO
PREVENT THE FINANCING OF THE HIGHWAY.

   SOME REPORTS SAID THAT BUSH HAD HELD TALKS WITH JAPANESE PRIME
MINISTER NOBORU TAKESHITA ON THE NEED TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL
ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY THE AMAZON REGION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE
"WORLD'S LUNGS."

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID: "PRESIDENT BUSH IS A POLITICIAN WITH
WIDE EXPERIENCE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE HE SAID SUCH A THING.  IF HE DID SAY
IT, IT WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS, BECAUSE HE WOULD BE INTERVENING IN OUR
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS."

   BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAY IS "A MATTER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY."

   BRAZIL AND PERU ARE SPONSORING A PROJECT TO BUILD A HIGHWAY THROUGH
THE AMAZON REGION TO JOIN THE BRAZILIAN NORTHWESTERN STATE OF ACRE AND
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE ASKED FOR JAPAN'S FINANCIAL
SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT.

   IN PRACTICE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A LAND CORRIDOR BETWEEN
THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS--AN OLD PROJECT OF THE BRAZILIAN
MILITARY GEOSTRATEGISTS.

   THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY MINISTERS SUPPORTED SARNEY'S POSITION BY
ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT "ANY TYPE OF FOREIGN FOREIGN
INTERFERENCE IN THE AMAZON REGION" AND THAT THEY REJECTED AS
"UNACCEPTABLE" THE ATTEMPTS TO LINK THE FOREIGN DEBT WITH INVESTMENTS
TO PRESERVE THE AMAZON FOREST.

   GARCIA INDICATED THAT IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HELP PRESERVE
THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, IT SHOULD "SPEED UP DISARMAMENT TALKS WITH THE
SOVIET UNION."  HE ADDED THAT "THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE AMAZON
REGION IS TO ELIMINATE DEADLY WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR BOMBS."

   GARCIA THEN REITERATED: "I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS
SAID THAT, BUT IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER
AND HE SHOULD GIVE US A CONCRETE OPINION."

   GARCIA DEFENDED RELATIONS WITH BRAZIL BY SAYING: "I BELIEVE
FORTIFYING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES IS A NATIONAL OBJECTIVE."  THEN HE ADDED: "BRAZIL IS ONE OF
THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRIES, AND PERU HAS WRONGLY LIVED IN
FEAR OF BRAZIL.  LET US HOPE THAT NOT ONE BUT FIVE HIGHWAYS ARE BUILT
THROUGH THE AMAZON REGION."

   SIXTY PERCENT OF PERU'S 1.3 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS LIE IN THE
AMAZON REGION.  THAT MAKES UP NEARLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE ENTIRE AMAZON
BASIN.

DEFENSE COMMITTEE (CODEH) SAID TODAY THAT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS
GUARANTEES CONTINUE IN THIS COUNTRY AND DENOUNCED SUMMARY EXECUTIONS,
POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS, AND INTIMIDATORY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PEOPLE'S
LEADERS.

   CODEH PRESIDENT RAMON CUSTODIO ISSUED A DOCUMENT ACCUSING STATE SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS OF BEING LINKED TO A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTS.

   CODEH STRESSED THAT THE MILITARY UNIT IN CHARGE OF "REPRESSION IS
BATTALION 3-16, LED BY COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ."  BATTALION 3-16
WAS CREATED IN 1982 AS AN INTELLIGENCE UNIT AND HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
ENCOURAGING THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF OPPOSITION POLITICIANS.  THIS
VERSION WAS REJECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES, WHO INSIST THAT THE "3-16" WAS
ABOLISHED MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO.

   CODEH SAYS THAT IN HONDURAS, "FACTS PROVE THAT VIOLATIONS TO HUMAN
RIGHTS ARE SERIOUS AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING AND
SANCTIONING THEM PUBLICLY DECLARE THEIR LACK OF RESOLVE AND ABILITY TO DO
SO."

   ACCORDING TO CODEH'S VERSION, IN HONDURAS OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, MORE
THAN 140 PEOPLE HAVE DISAPPEARED AND ABOUT 60 HAVE BEEN KILLED FOR

ALLIANCE WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC).

   THIS WAS STATED IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO LA PRENSA DIRECTOR JUAN CARLOS
PASTRANA.  RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT COPIES OF THIS LETTER TO ALL MEDIA.

   THE TEXT OF THE LETTER FOLLOWS:

MR PASTRANA:

   AN ARTICLE ON PAGE 1 OF YOUR 19 OCTOBER NEWSPAPER MAINTAINS THAT VERY
RELIABLE SOURCES HAD DISCLOSED THAT JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT A
MESSAGE TO THE FARC LEADERS LAST WEEK PROPOSING AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT
SUBVERSIVE GROUP.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT I HAVE SENT NO
MESSAGE TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.

   HOWEVER, THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THE EVIL INTENTION OF THE
ALLEGED WRITERS OF THE LETTER REACHES THE LIMIT BECAUSE THEY PORTRAY ME AS
THE SELF-CONFESSED CULPRIT OF ALL CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST UP [PATRIOTIC
UNION] LEADERS.  IT IS TRUE I WAS ACCUSED OF THE [FORMER UP LEADER JAIME]
PARDO LEAL ASSASSINATION.  HOWEVER, THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A
VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY.  NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN PURSUED IN COLOMBIA WITH SUCH
MALICE.  IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE PENAL CODE HAS FALLEN UPON ME, WHILE MY
OPPONENTS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED.

   REGARDING THE REST OF THE LETTER, IT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE MENTIONING
BECAUSE SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST.  THEREFORE, EVERYTHING IS FALSE.
MOREOVER, ALL SECTORS ARE FULLY AWARE OF MY PRINCIPLES AND MY STRUGGLE
TOWARD THE SO-CALLED FARC GROUPS.

   I CLEARLY WANT TO STRESS MY AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE
M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT], ESPECIALLY THOSE DEALING WITH CEASING OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEFINITE LAYING DOWN OF
WEAPONS.  THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD MAKING COLOMBIA SIT AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE, WITH NO EXCLUSIONS.

   THIS IS MY POSITION, AND THIS IS THE TRUTH.  I AM AWARE THAT THE
MISSION OF EACH ONE OF YOU, AS COLOMBIANS, IS TO BRING PEACE BACK TO
COLOMBIA.

   YOURS FAITHFULLY,

   JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA

FOUND A GRAVE CONTAINING THE BODIES OF TWO WOMEN WHO WERE BURIED MORE THAN
3 MONTHS AGO.

   THE HOUSE WAS RENTED IN 1987 BY LUIS EMILIO ESPINA, ALSO KNOWN AS

TORRE ALDAY AND AT THE OFFICES OF LAWYER LUIS ROSSMAN, A FORMER
DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA FE PROVINCIAL BANK.  THE EXPLOSIONS CAUSED SOME
DAMAGE, BUT NO CASUALTIES.

   JUDGE RAMIRO PUYOL IS CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO
CASES, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO POSITIVE RESULTS.

   THE TWO BOMBS EXPLODED ONLY MINUTES APART AND CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE
TO THE WALLS OF THE TWO PREMISES.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD OF THE LOCAL POLICE,
THE TWO BOMBS WERE PLANTED WITH THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING
THE OWNERS OF THE PREMISES.

   THIS AFTERNOON SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION ANNOUNCED THAT
BOTH ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF "FRIGHTENING" TORRE ALDAY AND
ROSSMAN, WHO WAS DIRECTOR OF THE PROVINCIAL BANK OF SANTA FE DURING
GOVERNOR JOSE VERNET'S TENURE.

   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT BOTH TORRE ALDAY AND ROSSMAN ARE LINKED TO
THE BANKRUPTCY CASES OF SOME LOCAL ENTERPRISES.  THEREFORE, IT IS
THOUGHT THAT THE ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF INTIMIDATING BOTH MEN.

   JUDGE PUYOL IMMEDIATELY BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE TWO CASES,

POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS."  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION "SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY" (ESA) HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WEDNESDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE RESIDENCE
AND OFFICE OF ALEKSANDR TRUSHIN, TASS CORRESPONDENT IN GUATEMALA.

   AN ESA BULLETIN DISTRIBUTED TO THE NEWS MEDIA STATES THAT THE
ATTACK AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY "WAS TO EXPRESS REJECTION OF THE
SOCIALIST-LEANING MEASURES" ADOPTED BY THE VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT.

   THE DOCUMENT EXPLAINS THAT "THIS IS A WARNING," BECAUSE IF ARREST
WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE FIVE CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE 11
MAY COUP, "ACTIONS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE
GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY," WHICH IS THE RULING PARTY.

   THE ATTACK, CARRIED OUT WITH TWO BOMBS, WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
SOVIET NEWSMAN'S HOME, LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF THIS
CITY.  THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY.

   THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE.  IT DESTROYED
AN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR.
HOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN
THE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT "WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION
HAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED."

   IT ALSO SAYS THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION.
IF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO
FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME."

   THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS "UBICO TOROKZIK" AND "RAFAEL
NETANAGIUHI," SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO,
FOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
PLANNED THE COUP.

   ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL
BLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD
MUSTAFA [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] "TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR
THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990."

   ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO
DAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN,
AND MARIO CASTEJON.  THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT.

   THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A "PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN
HECTOR GRAMEJO.  THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER
COULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES."

   ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS "GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE
PATRIOTS," AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION "WAS
A WARNING."

LEADERS AND THE MASSIVE MURDER OF PEASANTS, AS WELL AS TO PURGE ARMY
MEMBERS "CLEARLY COMMITTED TO THESE CRIMES AND TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS

THE TOWN COMPLETELY EMPTY AND ABANDONED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME
CHILDREN AND OLD PEOPLE WHO REPORTED THAT FOUR DEAD BODIES WERE LEFT

THE PERUVIAN ARMY HAS ALSO BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO THE MATTER.

   6. THE FALSE REPORT BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE KILLING OF A LARGE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM CAYARA IS COMPLETELY GROUNDLESS.  THE REPORT OF
AN ALLEGED BOMBARDMENT IS ALSO FALSE.  ALL THIS HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF
HINDERING THE ACTION OF THE FORCES OF ORDER WHO ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE

ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  THEY WILL
TAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM
SANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.

   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND
WILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL
MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON
IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL
TELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE
LACED CYANIDE.  DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE
THAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A
TERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE
OF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT,
NOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY
WHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT
THEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT.  THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE
DEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF
SAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT
IT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LATER, IN
THE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE
OF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES.  [END RECORDING]

   DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE
IMPASSE.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED
AT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.  NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM.  THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE
SAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED.
DE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES.  WE WILL TALK WITH
THE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [FELIU] IT IS THE RESULT OF A TERRORIST BOYCOTT.  IT IS
THE BEGINNING OF A BOYCOTT.  ALL CHILEANS MUST UNITE AGAINST THIS PROBLEM
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL OF US, NOT ONLY THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT.  

   [REPORTER] WHAT ECONOMIC DAMAGE CAN THIS BOYCOTT CAUSE THE CHILEAN FRUIT
INDUSTRY?  

   [FELIU] THE DAMAGE IS ENORMOUS.  IT CAN AMOUNT TO MORE THAN $800 [AS
HEARD] MILLION IN EXPENSES BEFORE THE END OF THIS EXPORTING SEASON.  THIS
HUGE LOSS WILL CREATE ALL TYPES OF PROBLEMS, NOT ONLY FOR THE FARMERS,
EXPORTERS, AND FINANCIAL SECTOR, BUT ALSO FOR THE SEA AND AIR TRANSPORTATION
INDUSTRY, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AND ALL SECTORS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
RELATED TO FRUIT EXPORT ACTIVITIES.

   IN SHORT, IT CAUSES A SERIES OF HUGE PROBLEMS FOR THE WORKERS, THE
BUSINESSMEN, AND ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THOSE EXPORTS IN ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.  [END RECORDING]

   FELIU MADE THESE COMMENTS AT THE END OF A VISIT HE MADE TO THE

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND SPARKED A DEBATE OF UNPRECEDENTED
BROADNESS AND DURATION TO ATTAIN A NATIONAL AGREEMENT TO SOLVE THE
CONFLICT.  THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED MUST BE INCREASED, STRENGTHENING THE
UNITY AND BROAD SUPPORT OF SECTORS THAT ADVOCATE PEACE WITH SOCIAL
JUSTICE AND NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE.

   IN THIS PROCESS, WE HAVE SHOWN FLEXIBILITY TOWARD PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES.  NEVERTHELESS, THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC), ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], AND
THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING
ELECTIONS WITHOUT WAR, IN CONDITIONS OF CLEANLINESS AND EQUALITY THAT WOULD
TURN THEM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.  THEY INSISTED ON
HOLDING THE ELECTIONS AS PART OF MILITARY PLAN THAT TRIES TO APPEAR TO BE
DEMOCRATIC TO JUSTIFY TO THE U.S. CONGRESS WHY THERE SHOULD BE CONTINUED
SHIPMENTS OF WEAPONS AND MORE MILLIONS IN AID.

   THERE WILL BE NEW ELECTION FRAUD AND DISPUTES BETWEEN THOSE WHO MURDERED
MONSIGNOR [OSCAR ARNULFO] ROMERO AND MASSACRED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
AND THE VORACIOUS CORRUPT DEVOURERS OF MILLIONS WHO HAVE MORTGAGED THE
COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  A FRAUD WILL TAKE PLACE IN A MILITARIZED COUNTRY,
WHERE MORE THAN HALF OF THE MUNICIPAL OFFICES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING, AND WHERE
THE MILITARY MANIPULATES THE BALLOT BOXES, VOTES, AND RESULTS -- AND THEY
WILL DO IT AGAIN, AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

   WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO SUPPORT THE
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND REJECT THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, URGING THEM TO FIGHT
AND REJECT THE ATTEMPTS TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO AN INSTRUMENT TO CONTINUE
THE WAR, URGING THEM NOT TO VOTE OR TO VOID THEIR BALLOT.  THE ELECTIONS
WILL ATTEMPT TO LEGITIMIZE THE WAR, AND THEY WILL BE HELD IN THE MIDST OF A
WAR.  THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE BOMBING CIVILIANS; THE POLICE WILL BE
CAPTURING, TORTURING, AND ASSASSINATING; THE JAILS WILL AGAIN BE FILLED WITH
POLITICAL PRISONERS.  PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE WILL BE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND BY WAVING THE SPECTER OF GENOCIDE OVER THE POPULATION; THIS
AMID THE DRAMATIC POVERTY OF THE DEPRIVED MASSES. [CONTINUED]

   SANTIAGO, 16 MAR 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] IN THE PRESENCE OF
SOME 50 MEMBERS OF THE PARTIES THAT COMPRISE IT, THE CENTER-RIGHT
POLITICAL COALITION COALICION POLITICA DE CENTRO DERECHA HAS BEEN
OFFICIALLY FORMED. THE CEREMONY, HELD AT THE NATIONAL PARTY
HEADQUARTERS IN THE OLD AND VENERABLE FERNANDEZ CONCHA CLUB, WAS
PRESIDED OVER BY SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, PATRICIO PHILLIPS, AND JAIME
TORMO.

   DURING THE CEREMONY, RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEAD JAIME TORMO SAID THAT
THE THREE PARTIES WILL NOW START ANALYZING THEIR COMMON POSITIONS, UNDER THE
EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF NATIONAL RENEWAL SECRETARY ANDRES ALLAMAND.

   JORGE MARTINEZ, OF THE NATIONAL PARTY THEN READ A JOINT DECLARATION.
THE THREE PARTIES REPORTED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO RESTORE THE
MIDDLE CLASS'S DIGNITY AND ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS CLASS
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST SPONSOR OF NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL, MATERIAL,
AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

   ANOTHER GOAL IS TO PREVENT THE COALITION FROM BECOMING A SUPER PARTY OR
MERGING WITH OTHER PARTIES. THIS COALITION WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AS SUCH,
AND ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION, BOTH AMONG MEMBER PARTIES AND
WITH PARTIES THAT MAY WANT TO JOIN THEM IN THE FUTURE.

   THE FIRST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL COALITION WAS TO
SEND A CABLE TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH TO POINT OUT THE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MEASURES THE UNITED STATES HAS ADOPTED AGAINST CHILEAN
FRUITS.  

   THE CABLE, WHICH WAS READ BY ANDRES ALLAMAND, STATED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] IN VIEW OF THE GROUNDLESS AND EXAGGERATED MEASURES
TAKEN BY SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION AGAINST CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS,
WE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES WILL RUIN A LARGE
SECTOR OF CHILEAN PRIVATE ENTEPRISE, WILL LEAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS JOBLESS, AND WILL CAUSE A SERIOUS IMBALANCE IN OUR BALANCE OF
PAYMENTS. THESE MEASURES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONS THE
CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD WITH THE U.S. PEOPLE, AND THEY WILL DEEPLY
INJURE THOSE WHO, LIKE US, DEFEND FREE ECONOMY AND FREE TRADE.

   MOST SERIOUS, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES APPARENTLY REWARD
THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HELP THE TERRORISTS
ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. [END RECORDING] 

   THE CABLE ADDS THAT CHILE HAS EARNED JUSTIFIED PRESTIGE AS A SERIOUS AND
EFFECTIVE EXPORTER; THAT IT HAS BEEN HONORING ITS FOREIGN DEBT AT A
SACRIFICE; AND THAT IT HAS COOPERATED IN SEVERAL PUBLIC WELFARE PROJECTS
SPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IN VIEW OF ALL THAT, THE COALITION
REQUESTS AN URGENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

MOUNTAIN RANGE, IN THE OMOA HILLS AREA, 100 KM NORTHWEST OF SAN PEDRO
SULA ON THE GUATEMALAN BORDER, WAS DISMANTLED OVER THE WEEKEND BY
COMBINED NATIONAL ARMY UNITS.

   MEMBERS OF THE II ARTILLERY BATTALION, SPECIAL TACTICAL BATTALION, II
INFANTRY BATTALION, AND III INFANTRY BATTALION PARTICIPATED IN THE
OPERATION.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL RESIDENTS, THE ARMY CAPTURED EIGHT ALLEGED
SUBVERSIVES AND SEIZED SUPPLIES, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND MARXIST LITERATURE.

   LA TRIBUNA VISITED CUYAMEL, RIO CHIQUITO, TEGUCIGALPITA, COMAYAGUA,
CUYAMELITO, POTRERILLOS, SAN CARLOS, CORINTO, AND QUEBRADA SECA IN CORTES
DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE OBVIOUSLY WORRIED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT
EXPLAIN THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS.

   THE VILLAGES WERE MILITARIZED ON TUESDAY LAST WEEK WHILE SPECIALISTS IN
ANTIGUERRILLA TACTICS WERE DEPLOYED TO "COMB" THE LOCAL MOUNTAINS.

   ACCORDING TO LOCAL RESIDENTS, THE EIGHT ALLEGED GUERRILLA MEMBERS -- WHO
WERE CAPTURED AND LATER TAKEN BY HELICOPTER TO THE 105TH INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS IN SAN PEDRO SULA -- REPORTEDLY INCLUDED AN OLD MAN AND A
MINOR.  THE PEOPLE ADDED THAT STRANGE PEOPLE COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AT
SUNDOWN, REPORTEDLY IN SEARCH OF FOOD.

   THE PEOPLE STATED THAT SOMEONE TIPPED OFF THE POLICE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF
THE SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PERSONS WHO CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS.  CONSEQUENTLY,
THE ARMY SET UP AN AIR LIFT.  THE LANDING STRIP WAS LOCATED IN A CLEARING
NEAR THE TOWN OF PUEBLO NUEVO.

   MILITARY VEHICLES WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN WITH SOLDIERS COMING OR GOING TO
THE MOUNTAINS.  "PAINTED - FACE" SOLDIERS WERE SEEN GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS,
WHICH THEY "COMBED" UNTIL THEY REACHED PINALEJO, SANTA BARBARA.

   "THE SILENCE IN THESE MOUNTAINS WAS SOMETIMES DISRUPTED BY SHOTS AND WE
WERE AFRAID.  WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO COVER OURSELVES FROM HEAD TO
TOE," AN OLD MAN, WHO WAS TOO AFRAID TO REVEAL HIS NAME, STATED.

   DURING THE DAY, THE PEOPLE MINGLE WITH THE MEN IN UNIFORM, WHO SOMETIMES
STOP PEOPLE TO ASK WHERE THEY COME FROM AND CAREFULLY SEARCH VEHICLES --
PARTICULARLY WHEN TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE MILITARIZED COMMUNITIES.

   COLONEL ERICK O'CONNOR, COMMANDER OF THE 105TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, ARRIVED
ON SATURDAY TO INSPECT THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT.
HE REFUSED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT WHEN APPROACHED BY LA TRIBUNA'S REPORTERS,
BUT ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMMAND POST WOULD ISSUE AN OFFICIAL REPORT TODAY.

BY THE GUERRILLA BOYCOTT.

MEASURES TO COUNTER THE BOYCOTT AGAINST THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, IN WHICH 1.8
MILLION SALVADORANS WILL ELECT THE SUCCESSOR TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE.

VOTERS AND THAT THIS MEASURE WILL AFFECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE SAME
DEGREE.  HE STRESSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT WANTS TO
DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND CAPITALIZE ON THE NUMBER OF NULL VOTES
AND ABSTENTIONS.

   VIDES CASANOVA NOTED ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE 19 MARCH IN 240 SALVADORAN
MUNICIPALITIES BUT THAT THERE ARE 22 TOWNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN AND
EASTERN REGION, WHERE VOTING WILL NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN VERY
DANGEROUS AREAS.

   VIDES CASANOVA SAID THAT DESPITE GUERRILLA TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, THE ARMY
CONTINUES TO RESPECT THE CEASE-FIRE DECLARED ON 28 FEBRUARY TO SUPPORT

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS DECIDED TO
COMBINE THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WITH AN
INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS INCLUDES THE
NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, WHICH WE NOW DECLARE TO BE
INDEFINITE.

   THE REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE IMPACT OF
OUR ACTIONS HAVE LED THE REGIME TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION,
AGGRESSION, AND THREATS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN A BID TO CONFUSE
THE POPULATION AND, IN ADDITION, TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ELECTORAL FRAUD.

   IN ORDER TO MAKE MATTERS CLEAR TO OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO THE LOCAL AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WE REPORT THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE GAGGING OF THE NATIONAL PRESS IS PART OF THE PLAN TO COVER UP THE
FRAUD THAT WILL BE COMMITTED ON 19 MARCH.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OVER THE
MEDIA IS INTENDED TO ATTRIBUTE TERRORIST ACTIONS TO THE FMLN.

   2.  THE REGIME HAS TRIED TO BLAME US FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE
ATTACK ON A RED CROSS AMBULANCE, AMONG OTHERS, FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.  THE
FMLN HAS A DEFINITE POLICY OF NOT HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE
HURLING OF GRENADES AT BUS STOPS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF ARMY PERSONNEL AND
IT IS THEREFORE PREPOSTEROUS TO BLAME THE FMLN.

   3.  A NUMBER OF FALSE COMMUNIQUES WITH AN OBVIOUS TERRORIST TONE HAVE
APPEARED.  THEY CLUMSILY GLORIFY VIOLENCE AND THREATEN THE PRESS IN TERMS
THAT ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE APPEARING IN DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE OUTLINE OUR
OFFICIAL POSITION.  WE EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS IN NO WAY OR AT
ANY TIME THREATENED THE PRESS OR THE CITIZENS.  WE RECALL THE FACT THAT OUR
OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES ARE SIGNED BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND AND BROADCAST THROUGH
OUR STATIONS.

   WE REITERATE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING AT THIS TIME IS TO REINFORCE AND
EXPAND UNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS.  THE
STRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WAGING WITH WEAPONS IN HAND IS AIMED AT AN ARMY THAT
HAS ONCE MORE DENIED TO OUR NATION THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A FORMULA FOR
A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AT AN IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY.

   WE MADE A PROPOSAL TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS, IN PEACE AND FOR PEACE, BUT
THE ARMY STUBBORNLY INSISTS ON HOLDING FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS, AT WAR AND FOR
WAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD DURING WAR.

ARRIVED OR DEPARTED SAN SALVADOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S 13 DEPARTMENTS.

   MUCH CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO PARALYZED BY THE

HELD UP AT THE SALVADORAN BORDERS UNABLE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST TWO BOMBS PLACED NEAR ELECTRIC POWER POLES WERE
DETONATED THIS MORNING IN SAN SALVADOR.  ONE WAS PLACED AT 16 WEST STREET IN

CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HAS SET UP IN SAN SALVADOR MUNICIPALITY.  

   IN THE OUTLYING CITIES OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MEXICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, AND APOPA, TRANSPORTATION IS STILL COMPLETELY PARALYZED IN
THE WAKE OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE FMLN, WHICH IS

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 19 MAR 89 (FBIS) -- [EDITORIAL REPORT]
[TEXT] (CLANDESTINE) RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI IN SPANISH TO EL SALVADOR
AT 1311 GMT ON 19 MARCH BROADCASTS APPROXIMATELY 35 MINUTES OF
MILITARY REPORTS, INCLUDING CLASHES BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS THAT TOOK
PLACE ON THE EVE OF THE SALVADORAN ELECTIONS AND ARE TAKING PLACE ON
ELECTION DAY ITSELF, AND DETAILS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION
STOPPAGE ON THE ELECTION PROCESS.

   A NUMBER OF REPORTS INDICATE THAT EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTOUTS ARE
HEARD IN SAN RAMON, SAN ANTONIO ABAD, CIUDAD SATELITE, AND OTHER AREAS
LOCATED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR AND IN SAN SALVADOR ITSELF,
WHERE OVER 20 EXPLOSIONS HAVE LEFT THE ENTIRE CAPITAL WITHOUT
ELECTRICITY.  ONE REPORT ADDS: "NO ONE IS VOTING TODAY, 19 MARCH;
TRANSPORTATION IS NONEXISTENT, AND NO ONE IS VOTING IN SAN SALVADOR OR
IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY.  THE 19 MARCH ELECTION FARCE IS A
COMPLETE FAILURE."

   ANOTHER REPORT STATES THAT FMLN GUERRILLA UNITS CLASHED WITH MILITARY
DETACHMENT NO. 1 TROOPS IN SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT,
AT 2200 ON 18 MARCH, INFLICTING FIVE CASUALTIES.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT
GUERRILLA UNITS ATTACKED ARMY FORCES IN TEJUTLA, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT,
INFLICTING OVER 20 CASUALTIES:  "AFTER OUR ATTACK, THE ENEMY BEGAN SHOOTING
AT TEJUTLA CHURCH, CLAIMING FMLN GUERRILLAS WERE HIDING INSIDE."

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY
ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY THIS MORNING FOR THE DEATH OF TWO REPORTERS WHO
WERE SHOT BY SOLDIERS IN THE PAST FEW HOURS IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE
EASTERN SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT, IN BOTH CASES, THE SOLDIERS FIRED WHEN
THE REPORTERS, BOTH SALVADORANS, IGNORED ORDERS TO HALT.  HOWEVER, FRIENDS
OF THE VICTIMS MAINTAIN THIS IS NOT TRUE.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMY PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THAT LAST NIGHT, AN AIR
FORCE MEMBER FIRED AT PHOTOGRAPHERS ROBERTO NAVAS AND LUIS GALDAMEZ,
SALVADORANS WHO WORK FOR THE BRITISH REUTER NEWS AGENCY, "WHEN THEY FAILED
TO STOP AT A MILITARY CHECKPOINT" AT A CAPITAL CITY AVENUE.

   NAVAS DIED AND GALDAMEZ WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  GALDAMEZ WAS LEFT LYING
IN THE STREET UNTIL HE WAS PICKED UP "SEVERAL HOURS LATER," BY HIS OWN
ACCOUNT, AND TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL, WHERE HE UNDERWENT SURGERY.

   ACCORDING TO HOSPITAL SOURCES AND REUTER, GALDAMEZ IS NOW "OUT OF
DANGER;" IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMPUTATE HIS RIGHT ARM, AS WAS
ORIGINALLY FEARED.

   ANOTHER REPORTER, MAURICIO PINEDA, A SOUND TECHNICIAN FOR CANAL DOCE
TELEVISION OF SAN SALVADOR, DIED THIS MORNING IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY AT A CROSSROADS, WHEN A SOLDIER FIRED AT PINEDA'S VEHICLE WHILE HE
WAS ON HIS WAY TO COVER TODAY'S ELECTIONS.

   THE ARMY SPOKESMAN EMPHASIZED THAT IN BOTH CASES, "THE SOLDIERS FIRED ON
SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING PEOPLE WHO DID NOT RESPECT THE STOP SIGN AT A MILITARY
CHECKPOINT."

   HOWEVER, GALDAMEZ SAID HE AND NAVAS, WHO WERE ON A MOTOCYCLE, DID STOP AT
THE CHECKPOINT AND THAT THE SOLDIERS FIRED ON THEM WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION.

   RAUL BELTRAN, ONE OF MAURICIO PINEDA'S COWORKERS, SAID THE CANAL DOCE
TEAM WAS TRAVELING IN A STATION WAGON WITH WHITE FLAGS AND SIGNS INDICATING
THEY WERE REPORTERS AND THAT THE SOLDIERS FIRED WITHOUT HAVING FIRST GIVEN
ANY INDICATION THE REPORTERS SHOULD STOP.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 (ACAN) -- [TEXT] AFTER A 1ST HOUR IN WHICH
THERE WAS A VERY SMALL TURNOUT AT THE POLLS, THE NUMBER OF SALVADORANS
GOING TO VOTE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND OTHER TOWNS IS INCREASING.
THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WERE STANDING IN LINES AT MID-MORNING.

   ARMY AND POLICE UNITS SURROUND THE POLLS WHILE MILITARY HELICOPTERS
CONTINUE TO FLY OVER THE CITY.

   FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] TOLD THE
PRESS HE HAS RECEIVED REPORTS FROM HIS FOLLOWERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO
THE EFFECT THAT 95 PERCENT OF THE POLLS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND ARE
OPERATING, AFTER OVERCOMING SOME EARLY MORNING PROBLEMS IN SOME OF THE
PLACES.

   THE POLLS OPENED AT 0700 (1300 GMT) AND WILL CLOSE AT 1700 (2300 GMT).

   THE BOMB EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTING HEARD THROUGHOUT THE EARLY HOURS IN SAN
SALVADOR WERE NO LONGER HEARD AFTER 1000 (1600 GMT).  

   HOWEVER, ATTACKS AGAINST VEHICLES AND CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND
THE ARMY CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.

   THE GUERRILLAS CONTINUE TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTIONS WITH A BLOCKADE OF ALL
LAND TRANSPORTATION, BUT THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL NOT DIRECTLY ATTACK
THE VOTERS OR THE POLLING STATIONS.

   HIGHWAY CHECKPOINT SOLDIERS KILLED TWO SALVADORAN REPORTERS, ROBERTO
NAVAS AND MAURICIO PINEDA, IN TWO SEPARATE SHOOTINGS LATE LAST NIGHT AND
EARLY THIS MORNING.  NAVAS WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM AN INTERNATIONAL NEWS
AGENCY, AND PINEDA WAS A SOUND TECHNICIAN FOR A LOCAL TELEVISION CHANNEL.

   PROMINENT AMONG THE ELECTORS, BOTH IN THE CAPITAL AND IN NEIGHBORING
TOWNS, ARE MANY MEMBERS OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, THE RIGHTIST
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHO ARE CARRYING BANNERS AND OTHER
VISIBLE SIGNS OF THEIR PARTY PREFERENCE.

   SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN ARENA'S CANDIDATE, ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY WIN THE ELECTIONS.

   ACAN-EFE CORRESPONDENTS WHO TOURED VOTING BOOTHS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER
TOWNS SAW SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN CAREFULLY CHECKING ALL VOTERS BEFORE
ALLOWING THEM TO ENTER THE VOTING AREAS.

   VOTERS WHO ARRIVE IN AUTOMOBILES HAVE TO LEAVE THEM MORE THAN 200 METERS
AWAY.

   IN APOPA, A TOWN SOME 12 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, THE VOTING BOOTHS
OPENED VERY LATE, BECAUSE THEIR LOCATION WAS CHANGED AT THE LAST MINUTE,
WHICH GENERATED PROTESTS FROM THE DELEGATES OF SEVERAL PARTIES AND LED TO
BRAWLS BETWEEN ARENA AND PDC SUPPORTERS.

   IN THE EARLY MORNING, MILITARY HELICOPTERS USED FLARES SEVERAL TIMES TO
LIGHT UP APOPA AND ITS ENVIRONS, PRESUMABLY TO LOCATE GUERRILLAS.

   MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, AN ALLIANCE OF LEFTIST PARTIES,
SAID IN APOPA THEY HAVE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS TO DISSUADE THEM FROM VOTING.

   IN THE SMALL TOWN OF TONACATEPEQUE, SOME 16 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR,
THE DELAY IN BEGINNING THE VOTING WAS ONLY HALF AN HOUR LONG, AND THE
ELECTION PROCESS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

    IN SAN RAMON, ANOTHER TOWN CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL WITH 30,000 INHABITANTS,
THE VOTING BEGAN AFTER A CONSIDERABLE DEALY BECAUSE OF A GUERRILLA INCURSION
IN THE DAWN HOURS.

   ARMY HELICOPTERS FIRED ROCKETS FOR SEVERAL HOURS AT THE SLOPES OF SAN
SALVADOR VOLCANO, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CAPITAL, PRESUMABLY AT THE
GUERRILLA COLUMNS THAT ATTACKED SAN RAMON.

PARTS OF NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   SANTIAGO, 19 MAR 89 (TELAM-ANSA) -- [TEXT] GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET HAS
SIGNIFICANTLY CURBED HIS CRITICISMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS
STEPPED UP HIS ATTACKS ON THE CHILEAN OPPOSITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TEMPORARY EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES LEVIED ON CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS.  

   "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE
POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY," PINOCHET SAID, IN MARKED CONTRAST TO HIS
STATEMENTS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

   THE CHILEAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE CALLED THE EMBARGO THAT THE UNITED STATES
LEVIED ON CHILEAN GRAPES AFTER CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN SUCH GRAPES IN
PHILADELPHIA "A SERIOUS MEASURE."  THE EMBARGO WAS PARTIALLY LIFTED
YESTERDAY.

   PINOCHET SAID THAT THE ANTI-U.S. REACTIONS IN CHILE WERE "UNFAIR" AND
REAFFIRMED THAT "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE
POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY."

   THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION, ESPECIALLY
THOSE "WHO ARE UNDERHANDEDLY ACTING AGAINST OUR COUNTRY," CALLING THEM
"TURNCOATS."

   PINOCHET ASKED:  "HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE GONE TO THE UNITED STATES TO BEG,
TO WHINE, AND TO SPREAD TALES IN ORDER TO STOP LOANS TO US?  HAS EVERYONE
FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN ASKING THE UNITED STATES
NOT TO GIVE US ANY MORE LOANS?"

   THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT "THE UNITED STATES HAD BEEN ATTACKED"
BECAUSE "THEIR INITIAL MEASURE WAS HASTY.  IT AMOUNTED TO USING A TANK TO
KILL A FLEA.  IT WAS A HARSH MEASURE WHICH HAD THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF
STOPPING OUR SHIPMENTS OF FRUIT ABROAD."

   PINOCHET EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT TO BLAME,
BUT RATHER "THOSE WHO HAVE REQUESTED A BOYCOTT AGAINST [WORDS INDISTINCT]."

   EL PARAISO (EL SALVADOR), 19 MAR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
ALEXANDER MENDEZ, COMMANDER OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, THE MAIN GARRISON
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, HAS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OVER 500
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS ATTACKED TWO TOWNS IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT HOURS
BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS STARTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE CLASHES, WHICH BEGAN AT 2200 LAST NIGHT AND
ENDED AT 0500 TODAY, RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SEVEN REBELS AND ONE SOLDIER
NEAR THE TOWNS OF TEJUTLA AND SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES.  ALEXANDER MENDEZ SAID
AT THE EL PARAISO GARRISON THAT THE HIGH NUMBER OF GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
INCLUDED "ATTACKERS AND OTHERS WHO PROVIDE COOPERATION AND CARE FOR THE
WOUNDED."

   THE OFFICER REPORTED 17 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 9 WOUNDED SOLDIERS.

   A PEASANT WOMAN DIED WHEN A BOMB EXPLODED IN HER KITCHEN DURING THE
ATTACK ON SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES.  THE EXPLOSION ALSO BLEW OFF HER SONS'
LEGS, THE MILITARY COMMANDER SAID.

   MENDEZ STATED THAT FIVE HOUSES WERE DESTROYED DURING THE ATTACK ON SAN
MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, 7 KM FROM THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE SALVADORAN OFFICER CONFIRMED THAT THREE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD
TRAVELED TO CHALATENANGO TO HELP COUNTER THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.

   ACAN-EFE WAS ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS INCLUDED A U.S.
AIR FORCE COLONEL, WHO WAS WEARING FATIGUES AND CARRYING AN AR-15 RIFLE ON
HIS SHOULDER.

   MENDEZ ASSERTED THAT THERE ARE USUALLY FOUR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AT THE
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND ADDED THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY WEAPONS LIKE
THE AR-15 "WHENEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT," ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT
PARTICIPATE IN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS.

   THE CLASHES CAUSED PANIC AMONG PEOPLE IN CHALATENANGO WHO COULD HEAR THE
HEAVY FIRING BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY SHORTLY AFTER
THE VOTING TABLES OPENED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN OFFICER, LAST NIGHT'S GUERRILLA ATTACK IS
"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE LATEST OFFENSIVE" LAUNCHED BY THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN SEPTEMBER.

   MENDEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NUMEROUS
WEAPONS.  HE EMPHASIZED THE USE OF THE NEW AK-M RIFLES, "A NEW VERSION OF
THE FAMOUS GDR-MADE AK-47."

RECORDING] [PONCE] [WORDS INDISTINCT] HERE IN EL SALVADOR IF THEY
WANTED TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO SLOWLY ESTABLISH
PEACE IN THE ENTIRE REGION.  THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]?

   [PONCE] WE CAN ASK THEM TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC, CIVIC LIFE TO
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE.

   [REPORTER] HOW DO YOU VIEW THE VOTING SITUATION AND THE SECURITY AND
SURVEILLANCE THE ARMED FORCES IS PROVIDING, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE DEATH OF TWO JOURNALISTS?  I THINK YOU ARE
AWARE OF THAT.  TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

   [PONCE] WE ARE THE FIRST ONES TO REGRET THE DEATH OF THE CANAL DOCE
NEWSMEN WHO DIED IN SAN MIGUEL AND THE REUTER CORRESPONDENT WHO DIED HERE ON
ARMY BOULEVARD.  THOSE DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREVAILING UNREST AND
NERVOUSNESS.  THERE ARE BULLETS BEING FIRED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE REPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO GET HIT.  THIS CONTINUES TO
BE A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] DID THE ARMY SUFFER CASUALTIES DURING THE INCIDENTS IN SAN
RAMON?

   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BRACAMONTE BATTALION CORPORAL DIED AND
ANOTHER SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED.  HOWEVER, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND
BRACAMONTE BATTALION SOLDIERS REACTED QUICKLY AND REPELLED THE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING CHAOS IN SAN SALVADOR.  

   [REPORTER] HAVE OTHER INCIDENTS BEEN REPORTED?

   [PONCE] IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE WHAT THE FMLN IS SAYING. THEIR
SPOKESMAN IN MEXICO CITY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK THE VOTING TABLES.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD THAT VOTING TABLES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN 15 AREAS OF
THE COUNTRY.  ATTACKS ON VOTING TABLES WERE REPORTED IN CHALATENANGO, SAN
ANTONIO, CIUDAD BARRIOS, CAROLINA, AND NORTH [WORD INDISTINCT].  IN
USULUTAN, THE FMLN PLANTED TWO BOMBS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY TO FRIGHTEN THE
PEOPLE.  HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE IS TELLING THE FMLN:  WE DO
NOT WANT TERRORISM, WE WANT PEACE, AND WE ARE USING PEACEFUL MEANS TO
ACHIEVE POWER AND CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.

   [REPORTER] HOW IS THE VOTING PROCESS PROGRESSING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS ARE NOT BEING HELD.
WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES, LIKE CINQUERA AND ARAMBALA,
WHERE [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE KNOW
THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO VOTING AND THERE ARE

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE PROTECTING THE VOTING TABLE BOARDS
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF OUR SOLDIERS ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRACY PLAN.
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME PROTECTION AFTER THE VOTING
CENTERS ARE CLOSED [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC].  WILL THE SOLDIERS
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE?

   [PONCE] FIRST, I EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT WE ARE URGING
THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PDC.  WE HAVE SENT A MEMORANDUM TO ALL THE
COMMANDERS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] CHIEFS ADVISING THEM THAT WE MUST HAVE A
COMPLETELY APOLITICAL ATTITUDE AND REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY
POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE MUST PROTECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, WE MUST PROTECT
ALL THE VOTING CENTERS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE AREAS
SURROUNDING THE VOTING CENTERS.  WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHO WINS THE
ELECTIONS; WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS
RESPECTED AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THIS IS A DAY FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
TO PROVE THEIR DEMOCRATIC NATURE.

   [REPORTER] WILL SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR VOTES TODAY?

   [PONCE] AS SOLDIERS WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.  BUT BEFORE WE CAST
OUR VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FULFILL OUR DUTY.  OUR DUTY IS TO GUARANTEE
SAFETY.  THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SOLDIER'S
IDENTIFICATION CARD WAS ISSUED IN SAN SALVADOR BUT HE IS STATIONED IN
AGUILARES, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT A SPECIFIC VOTING CENTER.  THOSE
WHO CAN VOTE WILL DO SO AS CIVILIANS AND THEY WILL BE UNARMED.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] MOSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND [WORD INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE REBELS HAVE THREATENED TO LAUNCH A
LARGE ATTACK.  DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MEN TO FIGHT THEM AT THIS TIME?

   [PONCE] SINCE 1982, WE HAVE [WORDS INDISTINCT] DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS.
[WORDS INDISTINCT] AMID SABOTAGE TO THE POWER SYSTEM.  WE ARE ALSO
EXPERIENCING A WATER PROBLEM [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ARE GOING TO EXERCISE

CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL OF EL SALVADOR, ANNOUNCED
THE END OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY IN A TELEPHONE
INTERVIEW WITH TASS.  THE COUNTING OF VOTES IN SUNDAY'S ELECTION IN
THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN OBSERVERS WAS IN PROGRESS, AND PRELIMINARY
RESULTS WOULD BE DECLARED LATER ON MONDAY.  POLITICAL OBSERVERS
BELIEVE THAT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CANDIDATE OF THE RIGHT-WING
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, HAS WON.

   STAFF MEMBERS OF THE [CENTRAL ELECTORAL] COUNCIL NOTED IN AN INTERVIEW
WITH [TASS] THAT VOTING BEGAN SLOWLY IN THE MORNING.  A TOTAL OF 1,835,000
VOTERS WERE REGISTERED IN THE COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION OF FIVE MILLION.
ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES OF JOURNALISTS IN SAN SALVADOR, THE PERCENTAGE OF
SALVADOREANS WHO ABSTAINED FROM VOTING WAS HIGHER THIS TIME THAN AT THE 1984
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH WAS WON BY JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, CANDIDATE OF
THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

   CONSTANT ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN DETACHMENTS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND ARMY UNITS INTERFERED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.  ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTION, THE INSURGENT RADIO STATIONS
[VENCEREMOS AND FARABUNDO] MARTI BROADCAST REPORTS THAT GUERILLAS WOULD NOT
ATTACK POLLING STATIONS.  INSURGENTS ATTACKED MILITARY GARRISONS IN MORER
THAN 20 INHABITED LOCALITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY, PUTTING OUT
OF ACTION SOME 150 GOVERNMENT TROOPS.  GUERILLAS ALSO DOWNED A HELICOPTER
GUNSHIP IN USULUTAN REGION.  AS A RESULT OF INSURGENT ACTIONS, A
CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE COUNTRY REMAINS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATION.  THE INSURGENT OPERATION TO BLOCK HIGHWAYS AND RAILWAYS
CONTINUES.

   [VIDES] CASANOVA, SALVADOREAN MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND PUBLIC SECURITY,
ADMITTED THAT THE ELECTION DID NOT TAKE PLACE IN 29 OUT OF 262 DISTRICTS IN
THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ARMY COULD NOT RESTORE CONTROL OVER
THOSE TERRITORIES.

   APART FROM MOTOR VEHICLES WITH TROOPS AND MILITARY PARTOLS, ONLY TAXIS

DAY.  PRESS CARS HAD WHITE HANDKERCHIEFS FIXED TO AERIALS.  THIS PRECAUTION
WAS TAKEN AFTER MILITARY PATROLS KILLED THREE JOURNALISTS:  ROBNERTO

CORRESPONDENT, AND MAURICIO PINEDA, A STAFF MEMBER OF SALVADOREAN

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
DAY OF FIGHTING THAT RESULTED IN ENORMOUS ABSTENTION DURING THE 19
MARCH ELECTIONS REPRESENTED AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE.
THIS WAS A FIGHTER'S WAY OF REPUDIATING THE WAR ELECTIONS THAT WERE
HELD AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] PEACE
PROPOSAL WAS BLOCKED.  IT ALSO REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THE REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WAS BENT ON CARRYING OUT A DEADLY WAR AGAINST
OUR PEOPLE DISGUISED AS A HYPOCRITICAL CENTRIST AND FALSELY DEMOCRATIC
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

   WE STRUGGLE FOR A JUST AND NEGOTIATED PEACE WITH GENUINE DEMOCRACY,
SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, AND WE GAVE A WORLD-RESOUNDING
BLOW TO THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THE THOUSANDS OF FMLN FIGHTERS WHO FOUGHT
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, CITIES AND INTERIOR, ENCOURAGED BY AN UNPRECEDENTED
INTENSITY AND SIMULTANEITY; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNION MEMBERS,
PEASANTS, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, DISPLACED PERSONS, UNEMPLOYED PERSONS,
GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL WORKERS, MOTHERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF POLITICAL
PRISONERS AND MISSING PERSONS, MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS,
BELIEVERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE CHURCHES WHO TOOK TO THE STREET
TO DEMAND THAT THE FMLN PEACE PROPOSAL BE ACCEPTED AND WHO LATER
REPUDIATED THE 19 MARCH WARMONGERING ELECTIONS; THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF CITIZENS, MORE THAN 1 MILLION PERSONS WITH VALID VOTING CARDS, WHO
REFUSED TO VOTE, AND THE MORE THAN 200,000 WHO CAST A VOID OR BLANK
BALLOT--SOMETHING THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA], AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] ARE
TRYING TO HIDE; THE TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
CONVERGENCE; AND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN
GETTING THEIR VOTING CARD THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE
DISCREDITED ELECTIONS ARE THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
WHO SAID NO TO THE COUNTERINSURGENCY WAR AND YES TO A JUST POLITICAL AND
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CONFLICT.  YES TO A REAL DEMOCRACY; NO
TO THE TRADITIONAL LIE OF A VOTE THAT ONLY SERVES TO JUSTIFY AND
FACILITATE U.S. MILITARY AID, WHICH PROMOTES THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR
AND WORSENS THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF POVERTY, MISERY, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND
REPRESSION BEING EXPERIENCED BY OUR PEOPLE.

   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WERE HELD, BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
SALVADORANS WHO LIVE ABROAD WERE KEPT FROM VOTING.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
FLED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PERSECUTED OR BECAUSE THE ARMED
FORCES FORCED THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES THROUGH THEIR BOMBINGS AND OTHER
ATROCITIES.  THEY ARE ACTIVE SALVADORANS.  THANKS TO THEIR WORK, HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS, MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE
REMAINED IN EL SALVADOR, CAN SURVIVE.  HOWEVER, THESE PEOPLE WERE DENIED
THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE, A RIGHT THE FMLN PROPOSAL TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO
A MECHANISM FOR PEACE WOULD HAVE GRANTED THEM.

   MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DECLARED HIMSELF THE WINNER IN AN ELECTION THAT
SAW THE LARGEST ABSTENTION IN THESE YEARS OF WAR.  MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE OR CAST VOID AND BLANK VOTES.  THE VOTES
CRISTIANI GOT DO NOT TOTAL 20 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  MANY OF
THOSE WHO VOTED FOR CRISTIANI WERE DECEIVED BY ARENA'S PROPAGANDA THAT
PROMISED EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, EDUCATION, SCHOOLS, PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMIC
RECOVERY AND PROSPERITY, ETC.  CRISTIANI AND ARENA KNOW THEY ARE GETTING A
COUNTRY DROWNING IN AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS, WITH A GROWING
REVOLUTIONARY WAR, AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES.  NO ONE
CAN DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FIRST ACHIEVING A JUST PEACE.  FOR ALL THESE
REASONS, ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ELECTION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER MORALLY OR

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 21 MAR 89 (BARRICADA) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] FAR
FROM ACHIEVING A TRUCE THE DAY THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WERE
HELD, A GENERAL INCREASE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS
THE RESULT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND THE
MILITARY HAVE SUBMERGED EL SALVADOR FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS.  ON THE ONE
HAND THERE WAS THE MILITARIZATION OF THE ELECTIONS THEMSELVES AND THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING AND MACHINEGUNNING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,
WHICH LEFT A TOLL OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS AS WELL AS THREE NEWSMEN
MURDERED BY ARMY MEMBERS.  ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE MILITARY
ACTIONS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INFLICTED 150 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY AND
BROUGHT 90 PERCENT OF TRAFFIC TO A STANDSTILL.

   THE VOTING STATISTICS PAINT A SIMILAR PICTURE:  IN 29 OF THE 262
MUNICIPALITIES IN WHICH THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED, THERE WAS NO VOTING AT ALL.
OF THE 2.2 MILLION SALVADORANS WHO SHOULD BE ON THE VOTING LISTS, ONLY 1.8
MILLION WERE REGISTERED, AND WHILE 60 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS SHOWED UP AT THE
POLLS FOR THE 1984 ELECTIONS, THIS FIGURE WAS COMPLETELY INVERTED THIS PAST
19 MARCH.

   TODAY -- JUST LIKE BEFORE THE BALLOTING BEGAN -- PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND
SOCIAL HARMONY IN EL SALVADOR [WILL NOT BE REACHED] AS LONG AS THE
UNITED STATES AND THE ARMY CONTINUE TO USURP THE POWER FORMALLY REPRESENTED
BY A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT, AND ANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- IN ADDITION TO
YIELDING ANOTHER FARCE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT HAS JUST BEEN STAGED -- WILL
ONLY RESULT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE THAT MIGHT EXTEND EVEN FURTHER AND
REACH EVEN BLOODIER PROPORTIONS.

   IF, ON THE CONTRARY, THOSE WHO REALLY HOLD POWER WERE INTERESTED IN A
NEGOTIATED, PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, THEY WOULD AT
LEAST BE TAKING THE FIRST SERIOUS STEPS TO MEET WITH THE OTHER BELLIGERENT
FORCE:  THE FMLN.

   FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, THE NEW ELECTORAL FARCE HAS ACCOMPLISHED
NOTHING BUT TO PROVIDE OVERWHELMING PROOF THAT IT IS ENTIRELY UNVIABLE AND
INEFFECTIVE.

   EAST BERLIN (EAST GERMANY), 22 MAR 89 (NEUES DEUTSCHLAND) --
[REPORT] [PETER KIRSCHEY] [TEXT] HIS NAME STANDS AT THE TOP OF THE HIT
LIST OF THE COLOMBIAN DEATH SQUAD: OSCAR DUENAS, MEMBER OF THE
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) AND CITY COUNSELOR OF
TUNJA, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL OF BOGOTA.

   IN A TALK DURING HIS VISIT TO BERLIN THIS WEEK, HE EMPHASIZED THE
DRAMATIC SITUATION IN HIS HOME COUNTRY.  IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN
UNPRECEDENTED ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS AIMED MAINLY AT FUNCTIONARIES
AND OFFICIALS OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- A MOVEMENT THAT INCLUDES COMMUNIST,
LEFT-WING, AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  MORE THAN 800 UP POLITICIANS HAVE
ALREADY HAD TO PAY FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR A DEMOCRATIC COLOMBIA WITH THEIR
LIVES, OSCAR DUENAS NOTED.  

   THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOT SAID THAT THE ALL-POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA, IN
ALLIANCE WITH THE LARGE LANDOWNERS, RIGHT-WING MILITARY, AND PARTS OF THE
OLIGARCHY ARE BEHIND ALL THESE ATTACKS.  THEY FEAR FOR THEIR POWER AND ARE
PREPARED TO USE ANY MEANS TO PRESERVE IT.

   FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE, OSCAR DUENAS REPORTED HOW THE DEATH SQUAD
PERSECUTES ITS OPPONENTS.  A GROUP WHICH CALLS ITSELF "RAMBO" HAS WAYLAID
HIM SEVERAL TIMES.  HOWEVER, UP TO NOW HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WARNED IN TIME.
THERE IS ALWAYS THE DANGER OF HIS BEING SHOT AT FROM A WINDOW, A PASSING
CAR, OR FROM BEHIND A BUSH.  THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HIM -- AND
OTHER UP POLITICIANS -- WITH BODYGUARDS AROUND THE CLOCK.  "EVEN THOUGH THIS
MEANS A PERMANENT THREAT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT!" OSCAR DUENAS AFFIRMED.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION, THE CITY COUNSELOR
OF TUNJA SEES AN OPPORTUNITY IF THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATES WITH ALL DEMOCRATS
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST GANG TERRORISM AND DOES NOT TRY TO SPLIT UP THE
MOVEMENT OF THE LEFT.

THAT ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS AND MERCENARIES AT THE SERVICE OF
DRUG TRAFFICKERS TODAY ATTACKED AN IMPORTANT POLICE STATION IN THE
JUNGLE DISTRICT OF UCHIZA, AND THAT THERE MAY BE MANY CASUALTIES ON
BOTH SIDES.

   THE RADIO STATION RADIO PROGRAMAS DEL PERU (PPR) BASES THEIR INFORMATION
ON A REPORT FROM A SPOKESMAN OF ANOTHER POLICE STATION OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE LOCATED IN TOCACHE, 145 KM SOUTH OF UCHIZA.

   THE RADIO STATION SAID THAT IT WAS ABLE TO CONTACT THE TOCACHE POLICE
THROUGH A HAM OPERATOR AND THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED INDICATES THAT
FIGHTING LASTED FOR SEVERAL HOURS MAY HAVE CAUSED MANY CASUALTIES.

   RADIO PROGRAMAS SAID THAT THE SO-CALLED "NARCOTERRORISTS" ATTACKED THE
POLICE STATION WITH FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.

   THE UCHIZA POLICE STATION IS 550 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA AND HAS A
COMPLIMENT OF ABOUT 50 POLICEMEN. THE POLICE SPOKESMAN TOLD THE RADIO
STATION THAT THE NUMBER OF TERRORISTS WHO ATTACKED THE POLICE STATION IS NOT
KNOWN.

   A PERUVIAN TELEPHONE COMPANY SOURCE SAID THAT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
LIMA AND UCHIZA, BOTH TELEPHONE AND RADIO, "ARE INTERRUPTED" BUT THE REASONS
FOR THIS WAS NOT GIVEN.

   UCHIZA IS LOCATED IN THE SAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE ALTO HUALLAGA
REGION, WHICH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY SHINING PATH FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS AND
HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH POWERFUL DRUG TRAFFICKERS ACCORDING TO PRIME MINISTER
ARMANDO VILLANUEVA DEL CAMPO.

   BOTH UCHIZA AND TOCACHE ARE CONSIDERED POTENTIAL ZONES FOR GROWING COCA
AND FOR MAKING COCAINE BASE. THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND
MILITARY CONTROL SINCE 1987.

   ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL POLICE, PERU IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF COCA

   THE GROUP WAS MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY 300 MALE MEMBERS OF THE SHINING
PATH AND NOTORIOUS LOCAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE COLOMBIAN.  THE

MAINTAIN A LONG FIGHT.  SOME OF THE CARTRIDGES FOUND IN THE AREA SHOW THAT
THEY COME FROM WEAPONS NOT NORMALLY USED IN PERU.

DESTROYED AT LEAST 10 POWER TRANSMISSION TOWERS, DAMAGING SEVEN HIGH

RATIONING.

   THE RESUMPTION OF THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ENERGY SYSTEM IS ACCOMPANIED
BY THE RESUMPTION OF REBEL ATTACKS AGAINST BROTHELS, TWO OF WHICH WERE
DESTROYED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.
THE BROTHELS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED THAT WOMEN

WHICH WAS A SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY [EPS] PLAN TO SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE
TOWNS ON THE HONDURAS-NICARAGUA BORDER.

BATTALION STATIONED IN SOMOTO WAS DEPLOYED TO THE EASTERN PART OF HONDURAS,
AND ENROUTE THEY WERE JOINED BY 300 MEN WHO WERE INSTRUCTED TO WEAR U.S.
ARMY AND CONTRA UNIFORMS.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, OF THE 300 MEN, 50 ENTERED HONDURAN TOWNS, AMONG
THEM ALAUCA, SAMAYARES, OROPOLI, AND SANTA MARIA, WHERE THEY CARRIED OUT
SABOTAGE AND PILLAGE IN THE HOPE THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BLAME THE CONTRAS AND
RETALIATE AGAINST THEM.

   MOREOVER, HE ADDED, FIVE MEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO ENTER THE 6TH INFANTRY
BATALLION'S POSITIONS IN OJO DE AGUA TO MAKE A SKETCH OF THE 110TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE BATALLION'S EXACT LOCATION AND ESTABLISH THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF

TRAPS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIONS, AND WERE EQUIPPED WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS,

   TO CONCLUDE, THE SOURCE SAID "OPERATION SUMMER 89" WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN

   CLANDESTINE, 6 APR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THE FUTURE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE THE
RESULTS OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTION, MORE SO THAN IN ANY OTHER PAST
ELECTION, DO NOT REPRESENT THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THOSE ELECTIONS WERE MARKED BY ABSTENTION AS A
RESULT OF THE REJECTION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] PEACE PROPOSAL.  THOSE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WHILE THERE
WAS A WAR AND WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THE
DUALITY OF POWER THAT EXISTS.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY
OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  WITHOUT
NEGOTIATION, NO ONE CAN RULE IN EL SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, A MILITARY
SOLUTION OR THE SURRENDER OF THE FMLN IS NOT POSSIBLE.  THE FUTURE
GOVERNMENT HAS TWO OPTIONS: TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL INCREASE THE
WAR OR TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MOVE TOWARD PEACE.

   THE FMLN JOINS ALL THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES THAT EXPRESSED
THEIR CONCERN FOR ARENA'S COMING TO POWER.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ITS [WORD
INDISTINCT] CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS
MODERATES.  IN LESS THAN 20 DAYS, AND WITHOUT FORMALLY ASSUMING POWER, THERE
HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AND SOCIAL TENSION, AS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED
IN DOZENS OF MISSING PERSONS, MURDERS, AND ARRESTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
LABOR UNION OFFICES AND THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS HAVE BEEN CORDONED
OFF; CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS; GRENADES AND BOMBS
HAVE BEEN EXPLODED IN PUBLIC PLACES; AND THE FMLN IS BLAMED FOR THOSE
ATTACKS.  JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED; THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMATIC
INTIMIDATION OF THE PRESS AND ATTEMPTS TO CURB FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; AND
MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS LINKED TO ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HAVE BEEN RELEASED
FROM PRISON.  THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS OF SEIZING LAND THAT BELONGS TO
COOPERATIVES; THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND
FOREIGN TRADE WILL BE PRIVATIZED AND THAT MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERS WILL BE
FIRED.  THERE IS A CLIMATE OF TERROR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THIS CLIMATE
OF TERROR IS THE RESULT OF THE ARROGANCE AND THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON THE
PART OF ARENA AND SECTORS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ARENA HAS CLEARLY STATED
THAT IT WILL HAVE A POLICY OF KILLINGS AND TOTAL WARFARE AND HAS GIVEN NO
SIGN OF WANTING PEACE.

   IT IS URGENT THAT AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR DIALOGUE BE CREATED.  THIS
MEANS ARENA MUST:

   1.  CEASE ALL KILLINGS, ARRESTS, DISAPPEARANCES, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ON
CIVILIANS; IT MUST RESPECT THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PUT AN
END TO MILITARIZATION OF WORKPLACES, MILITARY CORDONS, AND ALL REPRESSIVE
ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEATH SQUADS.

   2.  ARENA MUST RESPECT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND
AGRARIAN REFORM.  IT MUST ENSURE THAT COOPERATIVES' PROPERTY WILL BE
RESPECTED; THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROPRIATION HEARINGS INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BENEFITED FROM AGRARIAN REFORM; AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ECONOMIC
MEASURES AIMED AT FORCING THOSE PEOPLE INTO BANKRUPTCY OR INTO SELLING THEIR
LAND.  LIKEWISE, ARENA MUST PROMISE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MASS DISMISSALS OF
GOVERNMENT WORKERS.

   3.  ARENA MUST PROMISE A REAL DIALOGUE AND NOT A USELESS DIALOGUE AIMED
AT BRINGING ABOUT THE FMLN'S SURRENDER.  ARENA, AND THE SECTORS IT
REPRESENTS, HAS AND ALWAYS HAS HAD REAL POWER.  THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
THAT HAPPENS IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM, AS SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE AND THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE CLAIMED, A LACK
OF AUTHORITY TO CONTROL REPRESSION OR A LACK OF POWER TO NEGOTIATE.

   ARENA HAS ECONOMIC, JUDICIAL, AND LEGISLATIVE POWER AND IT HAS EVEN
SEIZED POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  ARENA HAS ITS OWN PARAMILITARY
FORCES, DEATH SQUADS, AND CONTROLS AN IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   AT THAT MEETING, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED GOVERNMENTS BOTH

UNCONVENTIONAL FORCES TO IMMEDIATELY HALT THEIR AID.

OF A HYDROELECTRICAL PROJECT IN ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA, NORTHERN NICARAGUA, THAT
WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY APPROXIMATELY 200,000 BARRELS OF OIL EVERY YEAR.

   ORTEGA SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CANNOT CRITICIZE THE ARMS BUILDUP IN
THE REGION WHILE IT PROMOTES MILITARY MANEUVERS AND BRINGS WEAPONRY INTO
CENTRAL AMERICA, PARTICULARLY INTO HONDURAS.  

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN HONDURAS HEIGHTENS
TENSION IN THE REGION AND DEALS A BLOW TO THE EL SALVADOR AGREEMENT.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SINCE THEY ARE MORE CRIMINAL THAN THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES THEMSELVES WHO CARRY OUT AMBUSHES, WHILE THEIR
CHEIFTAINS SIT IN LUXURY HOTELS IN TEGUCIGALPA, SAN JOSE, MIAMI, AND
WASHINGTON ENCOURAGING THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

    WHEN ASKED ABOUT FSLN ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN, ARCE
SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS NOT OUT PREPARING FOR ELECTIONS BUT IS CONTINUING TO
WORK TOWARD THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL THE TASKS THAT THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE
CARRYING OUT, PARTICULARLY THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AND FOR THE ECONOMY.

   WE WILL PREPARE OUR FORCES FOR THE FEBRUARY 1990 ELECTIONS, BUT FIRST WE
HAVE THE TASKS AHEAD FOR CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION,
HE ADDED.

   THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL ORGANIZE THE CELEBRATIONS WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON 19
APRIL.

   [COMMANDER] ARCE SAID THAT THE NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE MORE
"INTERESTING" IF THE PARTIES THAT BELIEVED THAT THE [REAGAN] ADMINISTRATION
WOULD DEFEAT THE REVOLUTION MILITARILY AND ABSTAINED FROM THE 1984 ELECTION
WOULD DECIDE TO JOIN THE CIVIC STRUGGLE.

   DUE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS OF THE REVOLUTION, EVEN THE CONTRAS COULD
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO'S WHO AND EACH PARTY
WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE, THE
SANDINIST LEADER SAID.

   QUITO, 11 APR 89 (RADIO QUITO) -- [TEXT] THE MARCH ORGANIZED BY
FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAS
TAKEN PLACE IN GUAYAQUIL WITHOUT MAJOR INCIDENT BECAUSE THE SMALL
GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS WAS CONTROLLED BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE POSTED ALONG 9 OCTOBER AVENUE, THE SITE OF THE DISTURBANCE.
FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES CORDERO, HIS WIFE, AND SEVERAL OF HIS
CLOSE SUPPORTERS MARCHED DOWN THE PORT CITY'S MAIN AVENUE FOR A FEW
MINUTES AND THEN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM HIS NEIGHBORS, WENT TO HIS
HOUSE.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE REMAINED
INSIDE THE HOUSE SINCE 1705.

   THE DISTURBANCES IN GUAYAQUIL RESULTED IN TWO INJURIES.  ONE OF THE
INJURED PERSONS IS 1ST COMPANY POLICEMAN LUIS CASTRO ROMAN, WHO HAS BEEN
ADMITTED TO LUIS VERNAZA HOSPITAL.  POLICEMAN CASTRO ROMAN WAS SHOT BY ONE
OF THE DEMONSTRATORS.  THE BULLET LODGED IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS CHEST.
THE BLOODY INCIDENT OCCURRED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES.  ALSO INJURED
DURING THE DEMONSTRATION WAS A CITIZEN WHO HAS NOT BEEN INDENTIFIED.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REPORTED THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE
DID NOT USE FIREARMS DURING THE DEMONSTRATION.  LEON FEBRES CORDERO'S MARCH
IN GUAYAQUIL BEGAN AT 1600 WITH A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PERSONS.  THE GROUP
GATHERED ON BOYACA AND 9 OCTOBER AVENUES.  THE DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN THEIR
MARCH BUT WERE IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLED BY THE POLICE WITH THE USE OF TEAR GAS
AND WATER.  FEBRES CORDERO'S WIFE WAS ALSO PRESENT ON 9 OCTOBER AVENUE; SHE
WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE TO MEET HER HUSBAND.  THEY THEN LEFT THE AREA WHERE
THE DISTURBANCE TOOK PLACE.

   IN CONCLUSION, THE DEMONSTRATION PLANNED BY THE SOCIAL CHRISTIANS AND
FORMER PRESIDENT FEBRES CORDERO'S SUPPORTERS RESULTED IN TWO INJURIES.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 13 APR 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] THE GROUP
OF 14 OPPOSITION PARTY DELEGATES HAVE RETURNED FROM GUATEMALA, WHERE
THEY SIGNED AN ALLIANCE AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES AND
HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN MANAGUA.
GUILLERMO POTOY, DELEGATE FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SAID THAT
THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS IF THERE IS
DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [POTOY] I BELIEVE THAT THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE WOULD
BE WILLING TO COME TO NICARAGUA.  JUDGING FROM WHAT THEY SAID, I BELIEVE
THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO RETURN ONCE IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS
DEMOCRATIZATION.  THEY TRUST THE 14 OR 15 OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND
SUPPORT THE DECISIONS MADE BY THESE PARTIES CONCERNING THE ELECTIONS.  IN EL
SALVADOR, THE WAR INTENSIFIED DURING THE ELECTIONS, AND THOSE WHO FINANCED
THE WAR CONTINUED TO FINANCE IT IN ORDER TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  IN
NICARAGUA, THE HUMANITARIAN AID ENSURES THAT NOT A SINGLE SHOT WILL BE
FIRED.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION.  WE MUST BEGIN AT THE
BEGINNING, WHICH IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AND NOT WHERE WE ARE NOW.
[SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE NOW.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
IN NICARAGUA?  THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF WAR, MANY DEATHS.  NOW A PEACE
PROCESS HAS BEGUN IN NICARAGUA.  THIS HELPS ENSURE THAT NOT A SINGLE SHOT
WILL BE FIRED AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN PEACE.  THEN WE
NICARAGUANS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY.  IT IS UP TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
TO INSTITUTE DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA, WHICH WILL ENSURE AN AUTOMATIC END TO
THE WAR.  I BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE, THE NICARAGUAN CIVIC
OPPOSITION, WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO JOIN ANY EFFORT ONCE DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN
ACHIEVED IN NICARAGUA.  [END RECORDING]

   SOFIA (BULGARIA), 12 APR 89 (RABOTNICHESKO DELO) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA, BY DETELIN SERTOV,
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RABOTNICHESKO DELO EDITORIAL BOARD] [TEXT]
[SERTOV] POLITICAL LIFE IN COLOMBIA IS STILL LINKED WITH VIOLENCE.....

   [CEPEDA] COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING AN EXTREMELY SEVERE POLITICAL AND
INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, CAUSED BY THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FAST
DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE FORCES AND THE EXISTING POLITICAL SETUP.  FOR EXAMPLE,
LAST YEAR COLOMBIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS 4.5 PERCENT.  HOWEVER, POLITICAL
LIFE CONTINUES TO BE DOMINATED BY THE TWO OLD PARTIES -- THE LIBERALS AND
THE CONSERVATIVES, WHO MAINTAIN A MERELY FORMAL DEMOCRACY.  WE SHOULD NOT
FORGET COLOMBIA'S STRATEGIC POSITION:  IT FORMS A BRIDGE BETWEEN CENTRAL AND
SOUTH AMERICA.  ALL EVENTS IN COLOMBIA AFFECT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  

   PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS, THE SO-CALLED "SANTA FE-2" DOCUMENT, DRAWN UP
BY EXTREME RIGHT-WING U.S. POLITICIANS, CONTAINS A PLAN TO APPLY PRESSURE IN
COLOMBIA AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO EXPAND THE SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY
CONFLICT, ONE OF WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS IS THE SO-CALLED "DIRTY WAR" IN THE
COUNTRY.

   ACCORDINGLY, THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA IS CAUSED BY BOTH INTERNAL FACTORS
-- THE CRISIS OF THE INSTITUTIONS -- AND EXTERNAL ONES, NAMELY THE POLICIES
OF THE MOST REACTIONARY CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES.

   [SERTOV] CAN ONE EXPECT THE PEACE SETTLEMENT TO BE FULFILLED UNDER THESE
CONDITIONS?

   [CEPEDA] THIS IS THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA [PCC].  AT
OUR RECENT 15TH CONGRESS, WE MADE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION AND
CONCLUDED THAT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA MUST BE SETTLED BY POLITICAL MEANS.
THE PCC RAISED THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THE SIEGE SITUATION THAT, WITH A FEW
INTERRUPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL DECADES, AND OF DISBANDING
THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS (ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS,
ABOUT 140 SUCH GROUPS ARE OPERATING).  THESE GROUPS OWE THEIR VERY EXISTENCE
TO THE SUPPORT GIVEN BY MILITARY CIRCLES AND THE CLAN CHIEFS TO THE TRADE IN
NARCOTICS.  (I WILL ADD IN PARENTHESES THAT THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE USE
OF THE TERM "NARCOMILITARISM" IN COLOMBIA.) ONE OF THE PCC'S DEMANDS IS THAT
THE ARMY SHOULD BE PURGED OF FASCIST ELEMENTS AND THAT A CIVILIAN SHOULD BE
PUT IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  THE PARTY ALSO RAISED THE
QUESTION OF MAKING A START ON THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT PAYS NO HEED TO OUR DEMANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH "M-19," ONE OF THE
PARTISAN GROUPINGS IN THE COUNTRY, BUT DID NOT ACCEPT ANY COMMITMENTS IN
PRACTICE.  ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE SOME DOUBTS OVER HOW THE LIVES OF THE
PARTISAN LEADERS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY GUARANTEED.  THE LARGEST PARTISAN
GROUP -- THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA -- IS DEMANDING THAT THE
GOVERNMENT TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO LIMIT THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS, IN ORDER TO
CONCLUDE A TRUCE.

   [SERTOV] CLEARLY, IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN COLOMBIA.

   [CEPEDA] AT THE MOMENT, PEACE SUPPORTERS IN COLOMBIA ARE FORMING 
A BROAD FRONT, WHICH IN PRACTICE HAS AN ANTIFASCIST ORIENTATION.  PEACE
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR THIS FRONT WILL SUCCEED IN EXPANDING, HOW THE
CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF REGARDING THE PARAMILITARY
GROUPS WILL DEEPEN, AND ON WHETHER WE WILL SUCCEED IN ISOLATING THEM.  WE
ARE OPTIMISTS, BUT ALSO HAVE A GREAT NEED OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY.

   [SERTOV] HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE POLITICAL PROSPECTS FOR THE UNITED LEFT IN
YOUR COUNTRY?

   [CEPEDA] THE LEFT FORCES IN COLOMBIA ARE UNITED IN THE PATRIOTIC UNION
THAT WAS CREATED 4 YEARS AGO.  ITS AIM IS TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
IN OUR COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THE UNION IMMEDIATELY BECAME A TARGET OF THE
ORGANIZERS OF THE "DIRTY WAR." HUNDREDS OF ITS LEADERS WERE BEATEN UP, MANY
OF WHOM WERE PCC MEMBERS.  SO FAR, OVER 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, INCLUDING
JAIME PARDO LEAL, LEADER OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN JOSE
ANTEGUERA, AND OTHERS.  THREATS CONTINUE TO BE MADE AGAINST THE UNION AND
AGAINST THE PCC.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE PCC LEADERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED DEATH
THREATS.  THE SAME ALSO APPLIES TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO, THE PRESENT LEADER OF
THE UNION, GILBERTO VIEIRA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE,
AND OTHERS.

   ON 27 FEBRUARY COMRADE FORERO [NAME AS TRANSLITERATED], PCC SECRETARY FOR
ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS, WAS KILLED.  HIS WIFE AND COMRADES SOTELO AND
SOTOMAYOR ALSO DIED IN THE ATROCITY.  NEXT DAY, WE HAD A MEETING WITH
VIRGILIO BARCO, PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA.  HE PROMISES TO TAKE SPEEDY MEASURES
AGAINST THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  HOWEVER, ONLY 4 DAYS LATER, ANTEGUERA, THE
FORMER LEADER OF THE UNION OF COMMUNIST YOUTH, WAS KILLED AT BOGOTA
AIRPORT.  SENATOR ERNESTO PISANO, ONE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATES FOR
THE PRESIDENCY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AT THE SAME TIME.  MANY MEMBERS OF THE
MILITARY WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT ON THAT DAY, AS WELL AS THE POLICE CHIEF
OF THE CAPITAL, YET ONLY ONE OF THE MURDERERS WAS KILLED, WHILE THE REST
ESCAPED.  THIS IS WHY WE TOLD PRESIDENT BARCO THAT WE HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS
ABOUT THE ARMY'S ROLE IN THIS ASSASSINATION.  

   NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND ELECTIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES
ARE DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA.  THE PCC AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION WANT TO
TAKE PART IN THEM, BUT WE HAVE WARNED THE LEADERS OF THE REPUBLIC THAT
UNLESS THE "DIRTY WAR" IS ENDED, WE WILL EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA TO
THE WORLD AND REGARD THE ELECTION RESULTS AS ILLEGAL.  DESPITE EVERYTHING,
WE CONSIDER THAT THE PATRIOTIC UNION HAS A PROMISING FUTURE, BECAUSE ITS
AIMS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

PRESIDENT BARCO VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED COLOMBIA'S IMAGE REGARDING ITS
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, AND COMMON CRIME IN A
SPEECH HE GAVE IN WASHINGTON THIS MORNING.  HE POINTED TO THE
ERADICATION OF ILLITERACY, COMMENTED ON THE NATION'S ECONOMIC INDEXES,
AND SAID THAT COUNTLESS COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN THEIR
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   PRESIDENT BARCO INVITED OTHER AREA COUNTRIES TO JOIN EFFORTS TO END DRUG
CULTIVATION, TRAFFICKING, AND CONSUMPTION.  COLOMBIA CANNOT FIGHT THIS EVIL
ALONE, BARCO ASSERTED.  HE GAVE SPECIFIC STATISTICS ABOUT BLOWS THAT HAVE
BEEN STRUCK AGAINST COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BARCO] I CAME TO MAKE AN APPEAL TO YOU.  LET US ALL
COMBINE OUR EFFORTS AND ENERGIES IN AN ALLIANCE THAT IS STRONGER AND BETTER
COORDINATED THAN THAT OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE NEED AN ALLIANCE OF
NATIONS AFFECTED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING IN ORDER TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY.  DRUG
TRAFFICKING IS NOT THE PROBLEM OF A SINGLE NATION, OR EVEN OF A GROUP OF
NATIONS.  IT IS A UNIVERSAL OUTRAGE.  UNLESS WE DEVISE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE
MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL PHASES OF THE
PROBLEM, A FINAL VICTORY WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.

   FOR THIS REASON, I WISH TO USE THIS FORUM TO MAKE A NEW PROPOSAL TO
REFLECT THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL WITH REGARD TO THIS PROBLEM.
WE -- ALL PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE, ALONG WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES OF THOSE NATIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL
DRUG TRAFFICKING SCOURGE -- SHOULD MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO JOINTLY
EXERCISE THE PUBLIC, POLITICAL AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON US BY THE WILL OF
OUR PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REITERATED HIS CONDEMNATION OF WEAPONS PRODUCTION
AND TRAFFICKING, HIGHLIGHTED COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRACY, AND SAID THAT HIS COUNTRY
WILL INCREASE EFFORTS IN ITS CONTINUED STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS] [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] YOU MENTIONED THE
ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO.  WE
WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE US SOME DETAILS ON THIS.

   [CRISTIANI] AT APPROXIMATELY 0530 THIS MORNING, THREE EXPLOSIVES WERE
HURLED AT HIS RESIDENCE FROM AN EMPTY LOT.  THE EXPLOSIVES CAUSED EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE TO THE RESIDENCE.  THERE WAS RIFLE FIRE TOO, BUT THE RIFLE FIRE WAS
ONLY TO DISTRACT SECURITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.

   THE ATTACKERS ACTED LIKE ANIMALS.  MR MERINO IS STILL IN THE UNITED
STATES WITH HIS WIFE.  HE WILL BE RETURNING THIS AFTERNOON.  THEIR FOUR
CHILDREN AND THREE OF THE CHILDREN'S FRIENDS WERE AT THE RESIDENCE WHEN THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE.  THE CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THOSE WHO CARRIED
OUT THIS ATTACK ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.  THIS ATTACK ENDANGERED
CIVILIANS.  THANK GOODNESS ONLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN WAS WOUNDED.  ONE OF
THE GIRLS WHO WAS VISITING THE HOME WAS HIT BY SOME SHRAPNEL BUT THE WOUND
IS NOT SERIOUS.  RIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE THE CHILDREN
TO SEE IF THEIR HEARING HAS BEEN DAMAGED BECAUSE TWO OF THE DEVICES
EXPLODED IN THE BEDROOM THE CHILDREN WERE IN.

   I BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], FAR FROM SEEKING PEACE AND WANTING PEACE
FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WANTS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORISM, ITS KILLINGS --
ITS IRRATIONAL KILLINGS.  I BELIEVE THAT LITTLE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SINCERE WHEN
THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCE.  THEY STATED THEIR OPINION
ON 19 MARCH.  THE FMLN SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE FLATLY
REJECTED VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF OUR
PARTY WILL BE FRIGHTENED INTO ABANDONING THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION
OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE WANT.

   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE FMLN LOOK LIKE MARTYRS AND LIKE
PERSONS WHO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH:  THEY
ARE NOTHING BUT SAVAGES WHO LACK HUMAN QUALITIES AND WHO ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING AND WOUNDING CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]

ANOTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS EVENING WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE THEY WERE
ATTEMPTING TO HURL FROM A PASSING MOTORCYCLE AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE IN
TEGUCIGALPA EXPLODED BEFORE THEY COULD THROW IT.

   THE DEAD MAN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 39-YEAR-OLD MIGUEL RODOLFO AGUILAR
FLORES OF TEGUCIGALPA.  HIS BODY WAS BLOWN TO BITS BY THE EXPLOSION.  

   THE WOUNDED MAN HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.  HE WAS ADMITTED IN A
SEMICONSCIOUS STATE TO THE BURNS UNIT OF THE ESCUELA HOSPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE BOMB WAS CHINESE-MADE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DETONATED BY HEAT FROM THE MOTORCYCLE OR FROM FRICTION CREATED AS A RESULT
OF BEING PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON THE MOTORCYCLE.

   ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE TWO MEN DROPPED THE BOMB WHEN THEY TRIED TO
THROW IT AT THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS LOCATED 1 KM NORTHWEST OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY.  POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB WAS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE U.S.
EMBASSY WAREHOUSE BY MEMBERS OF THE HONDURAN LEFT TO COMMEMMORATE WHAT
PEOPLE HERE CALL "BLACK APRIL" FOR THE UNITED STATES.

ENGINEER MIGUEL RINCON RINCON IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE POLICE FOUND
SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA FROM THE OUTLAWED REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU

COLOMBIA'S M-19 REBEL GROUP INTO CIVILIAN LIFE WOUND UP TUESDAY WITH
AGREEMENT THAT THE PROCESS MUST BE COMPLETED BY JUNE 30.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE M- 19 GROUP,
WHICH ACCEPTED A TRUCE LAST MONTH AFTER 16 YEARS OF FIGHTING, REACHED THE
ACCORD AT A "WORKING SESSION" AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.

   NO OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WAS RELEASED, BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE TALKS SAID
THE PARTIES HAD AGREED TO CONTINUE BI-WEEKLY PARLEYS AND TO CREATE A GENERAL
SECRETARIAT COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE DELEGATIONS.

   THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS NAMED AS GUARANTOR OF ANY FINAL AGREEMENT.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP SIGNED ITS TRUCE MARCH 18 UNDER A PEACE PLAN
ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS SAID REBEL
LEADERS WOULD BE PARDONED.

   THE TALKS HAVE YET TO BROACH THE THORNY SUBJECT OF THE 2,500- STRONG
GROUP'S HANDING OVER ITS ARMS.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1973 AS A PROTEST AGAINST
WHAT IT SAID WAS ELECTORAL FRAUD COMMITTED BY THEN- STRONGMAN GUSTAVO ROJAS
PINILLA.  ITS ORIGINAL MEMBERS WERE DISSIDENT GUERRILLAS FROM OTHER GROUPS,
PROFESSIONALS, WORKERS, STUDENTS AND FORMER SOLDIERS.

   IN JANUARY 1974, THE REBEL GROUP MADE HEADLINES BY STEALING A SWORD THAT
HAD BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVAR -- WHO LED THE WARS OF INDEPENDENCE IN MOST OF
NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA -- WHICH THEY PROMISED TO USE TO "REDEEM" THE COUNTRY.

   M-19'S MOST SPECTACULAR OPERATION WAS ITS 1985 TAKEOVER OF THE PALACE OF
JUSTICE IN BOGOTA. IN THE MILITARY OPERATION TO RETAKE THE BUILDING, MORE
THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED, INCLUDING SIX TOP JUDGES AS WELL AS VISITORS,
EMPLOYEES AND REBELS.

   THE REBELS WERE REPORTEDLY HIRED BY DRUG KINGPINS TO STORM THE BUILDING
AND DESTROY DOCUMENTS TO BE USED IN PROCEEDINGS TO EXTRADITE THE DRUG LORDS
TO THE UNITED STATES.

CREDIT TODAY FOR THE ATTACK ON A U.S. ARMY CONVOY ON 11 APRIL IN NORTHERN
HONDURAS IN WHICH ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND
ONE VEHICLE DESTROYED.

   THE ATTACK ON AN 11-VEHICLE CONVOY CARRYING U.S. AND HONDURAN SOLDIERS
TOOK PLACE 17 KM NORTHEAST OF OLANCHITO, IN YORO DEPARTMENT, ON THE NORTHERN
COAST OF HONDURAS.  

   PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT U.S. AND HONDURAN TROOPS ARE BUILDING A
HIGHWAY FOR MILITARY EMERGENCIES AND CIVIL DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED IN OLANCHITO, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT
(FPM) CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK, AND SAID THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY
THE RAMON AMAYA AMADOR COMMANDO GROUP [COMANDO RAMON AMAYA AMADOR].

   THE GUERRILLA COMMUNIQUE STATED "THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH RIFLE
FIRE AND HAND GRENADES, WHICH NEUTRALIZED THE REARGUARD OF THE YANKEE CONVOY
AND RESULTED IN ONE DEAD, THREE OR FOUR WOUNDED, AND ONE DESTROYED VEHICLE."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT "THE YANKEES REFUSE TO REPORT THEIR CASUALTIES
SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR TROOPS.  OUR RIFLES WILL BE AIMED AT THE
BLONDS FROM THE NORTH WHO ARE TODAY TRAMPLING ON OUR SACRED FATHERLAND."

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA HAVE
CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION ANY CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH THEY
ADMIT THAT THE LAST VEHICLE IN THE CONVOY WAS "DAMAGED" BY AN EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE THAT WAS HURLED AT IT.

   ON 1 FEBRUARY, ANOTHER U.S. MILITARY CONVOY WAS ATTACKED IN THE SAME AREA
BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, WITHOUT CAUSING ANY CASUALTIES BUT DAMAGING ONE
TRUCK.

   THAT ATTACK WAS ALSO CLAIMED BY THE FPM, WHICH SAID IT HAD WOUNDED SOME
AMERICANS.

   THE FPM FIRST APPEARED IN SAN PEDRO SULA IN 1979 AND HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR
SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AND RURAL GUERRILLA ACTIONS.

   RAMON AMAYA AMADOR, THE NAME USED BY THE HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, WAS A
LEFTIST NOVELIST WHO WROTE ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AMONG
HONDURANS.  HE ALSO CONDEMNED FOREIGN INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY U.S.
INTERVENTION, IN HONDURAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.

   IN TELEPHONE CALLS TO LOCAL RADIO STATIONS, THE COMMANDO UNIT STATED:
"WE WERE BORN THROUGH ANTISUBVERSIVE COMBAT; HOWEVER, WE ARE AN ESSENTIALLY
DEMOCRATIC FORCE, BECAUSE WE HAVE COME TO CONFRONT THE MONOPOLIZING AND
TOTALITARIAN EFFORTS OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE],
WHICH WILL BE THE RULING PARTY AS OF 1 JUNE."

   THE NEW "DEATH SQUAD" SPOKESMAN SAID:  "WE ARE CONFRONTING THE WORTHLESS
(VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT) MERINO AND (ARENA LEADER) D'AUBUISSON.  WE RECENTLY
GAVE THEM A DISSUASIVE SIGNAL, AND TODAY WE GAVE THEM A SECOND ONE..."

   LAST WEEK FRANCISCO MERINO'S RESIDENCE WAS THE TARGET OF A BOMB ATTACK,
THOUGH THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES [AS RECEIVED].

   "WE ARE AGAINST EVERY ACT OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE ARMED
FORCES AND CURRENT ACTS OF REPRESSION BY THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS,
AS WELL AS ALL ACTIONS AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRACY."

   IN CONCLUSION, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS A VEILED THREAT AGAINST FRANCISCO
GUERRERO, PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, WHO IS CHARGED WITH A
"FIFTH COLUMN ACTION."

   THIS IS THE SECOND "DEATH SQUAD" THAT HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE
COUNTRY IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

   ON 14 APRIL, SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK ON MERINO, THE SELF-STYLED

NEW GUERRILLA COMMANDO UNIT OR DEATH SQUAD.

   [COMMANDO] OUR FORCE IS CALLED THE GERARDO BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE.  WE WERE
BORN MAINLY THROUGH ANTISUBVERSIVE COMBAT; HOWEVER, WE ARE AN ESSENTIALLY
DEMOCRATIC FORCE, BECAUSE WE ARE OPPOSED TO...  [CORRECTS HIMSELF] WE HAVE
CONFRONTED THE MONOPOLIZING AND TOTALITARIAN EFFORTS OF ARENA [NATIONALILST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE].  CAN YOU HEAR ME?

   [REPORTER] YES, QUITE CLEARLY.  

   [COMMANDO] HELLO?  

   [REPORTER] I CAN HEAR YOU.  PLEASE CONTINUE.  

   [COMMANDO] WE ARE STRATEGICALLY CONFRONTING THE MANIPULATIONS OF THE
WORTHLESS [VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT] MERINO AND [ARENA LEADER] D'AUBUISSON.
WE GAVE THEM OUR SECOND DISSUASSIVE SIGNAL TODAY.  WE HOPE THEY WILL STOP
MANAGING GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS BY RAIDING, REMOVING, APPOINTING, AND
BEHEADING [DEGOLLAR] PUBLIC OFFICIALS.  THIS MUST BE DEALT WITH IN A
DIFFERENT FASHION.

   WE ALSO WANT THEM TO STOP THEIR INTRIGUES AND CONSPIRACIES WITHIN THE
ARMED FORCES AND THEIR PRESSURE ON THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL
AS ALL GRIEVOUS ACTIONS AIMED AT DISCREDITING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH
AS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY.  WE ALSO WANT FRANCISCO GUERRERO TO STOP HIS
FIFTH-COLUMN ACTION IN THE PCN [NATIONAL CONCILIATION PARTY] TO DIVIDE
THE PARTY.  YOU CANNOT TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AGAINST DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  THIS IS
A SECOND DISSUASSIVE SIGNAL.  CAN YOU HEAR ME?

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE SECOND SIGNAL?  

   [COMMANDO] WELL, ONLY...

   [MARQUEZ] THIS WAS THE TELEPHONE CALL RECEIVED AT RADIO CADENA
YSU'S PRESS DEPARTMENT FROM THIS NEW GROUP THAT CALLS ITSELF THE GERARDO
BARRIOS CIVIC FORCE, WHICH HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON
SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO. [END RECORDING]

   RIO DE JANEIRO (BRAZIL), 20 APR 89 (REDE GLOBO TELEVISION) -- 
[TEXT] THREE OFFICIALS OF BRASPETRO [BRAZILIAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION
INTERNATIONAL, INC.] HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS FROM
THE MEDIO MAGDALENA PETROLEUM BASIN, IN COLOMBIA.

   THE GUERRILLAS LAST NIGHT ATTACKED THE OIL WELL ISLA TABACO I. THEY
CAUSED A LARGE FIRE AND ESCAPED, TAKING AS HOSTAGES BRAZILIAN ENGINEERS
PAULO CESAR PAIM DE OLIVEIRA, AUGUSTO CARNEIRO MOREIRA JUNIOR, AND JOSE
ROBERTO REIS, IN ADDITION TO A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN WHO WAS ALSO WORKING
THERE.  

   BRASPETRO PRESIDENT WAGNER FREIRE TODAY RELEASED AN OFFICIAL NOTE
CONFIRMING THE KIDNAPPING. BOTH BRASPETRO AND THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN
BOGOTA ARE WORKING TO RESCUE THE BRAZILIAN ENGINEERS.

   SO FAR THE GUERRILLA GROUP HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ITSELF OR DEMANDED ANY
RANSOM FOR THE HOSTAGES.

   CLANDESTINE, 22 APR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE NOW
UNFOLDED OUR MILITARY MAP, ON WHICH WE HAVE PLACED A SMALL BLACK
CIRCLE AT EACH COMBAT SITE, A RED CIRCLE AT THE SITE OF EACH ACT OF
SABOTAGE, AND A GREEN CIRCLE FOR EACH AMBUSH OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, THE BLACK CIRCLES ON OUR MAP HAVE BEEN
CONCENTRATED IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE EASTERN REGION.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE
MOST PROMINENT ACTION HAS BEEN THE ATTACK ON THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS IN
SAN SALVADOR'S DENSELY POPULATED SANTA ANITA NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE ARE
WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL WAR BULLETIN ON THAT ACTION.

   ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ATTACK IS THAT IT WAS
STAGED DESPITE THE ARMY'S PRESENCE IN THE HEART OF THE CAPITAL, AND IT
OCCURRED IN FULL DAYLIGHT.  AT NOON ON FRIDAY, A CONTINGENT OF URBAN
GUERRILLAS GOT WITHIN 50 METERS OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS AND LAUNCHED AN
ATTACK WITH RIFLES AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS. EVERY SHOT HIT ITS TARGET.  ARMED
FORCES PATROLS TRIED TO CUT OFF OUR FIGHTERS' RETREAT THROUGH THE STREETS OF
THE CAPITAL, BUT THE SOLDIERS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, THE
PEOPLE THEMSELVES FORM A MOUNTAIN THAT PROVIDES COVER FOR OUR URBAN
GUERRILLAS.

   EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING, WE AMBUSHED AN ARMY CONVOY ON THE PAN AMERICAN
HIGHWAY AT EL PUNTILLAL, YAPATZTEPEQUE, USING EIGHT EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.
THE AMBUSHED TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY OTHER UNITS, WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT FOR
AN HOUR.  THIS AMBUSH WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST ENEMY ARMORED UNITS.  THE
RESULT OF THIS ACTION WAS AN ESTIMATED 35 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING AN OFFICER
OF THE TECHUACAN BATTALION'S RECONDO UNIT AND A CAVALRY OFFICER.  FOR OUR
PART, WE REPORT THE HEROIC LOSS IN BATTLE OF OUR COMRADE JACKSON.

   OUR REVOLUTIONARY SALUTE TO THE BRAVE FIGHTERS OF EL PUNTILLAL, WHO
INFLICTED THIS LARGE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ON 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ON
THE PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY.

   PRAGUE (CZECHOSLOVAKIA), 21 APR 89 (RUDE PRAVO) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL
COMMITTEE POLITBURO, BY VERA POSLEDNI] [TEXT] RECENTLY COMRADE MANUEL
CEPEDA, MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE
POLITBURO, VISITED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WE ASKED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW.

   [POSLEDNI] IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH, THREE
LEADING OFFICIALS OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE LEFTIST
COALITION, THE PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), COMRADES FORERO, SOTELO, AND ANTEQUERA,
WERE MURDERED IN COLOMBIA.  WHY?  

   [CEPEDA] IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF
SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING.  THE INTERNAL POLITICAL
CRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS
AND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR.  IN THE SANTA
FE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT
IS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA
WILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.  THE SO-CALLED
EXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST
THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO
PREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED.  IN COLOMBIA
SOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES.  THIS IS MANIFESTED IN
HUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO
AND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY
LEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE
ARMED FORCES.

   [POSLEDNI] SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR.  

   [CEPEDA] THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY
KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE
PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS
IN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY
THIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO
CRITICIZE THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES
BY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN).
WE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM.  WE
ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LONG AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO END THE CONFLICT, IT IS
NECESSARY TO HUMANIZE IT AND TO RESPECT HUMAN LIVES.  THESE ARE THE TACTICS
OF SOLDIERS -- TO LABEL THE PARTISANS AS TERRORISTS AND THEN MASSACRE THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS SUSPECTS WHO ARE COLLABORATING WITH TERRORISM.

   [POSLEDNI] PARTISANS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC) OFFERED THE GOVERNMENT A DIALOGUE ABOUT A TRUCE.  HOW DO THEY WANT TO
CONDUCT THIS?

   [CEPEDA] THE FARC, WHICH IS THE STRONGEST ELEMENT OF THE COLOMBIAN
PARTISAN MOVEMENT AND A MEMBER OF ITS COORDINATING COMMITTEE, UNILATERALLY
ADOPTED A CEASE-FIRE AND PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION FOR THIS
DIALOGUE.  IN IT ARE TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE LIBERAL LOPEZ MICHELSEN AND
THE CONSERVATIVE PASTRANA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS
ECHEVERRI CORREA, AND BOGOTA'S CARDINAL REBOLLO.  THE FARC WANTS THE
GOVERNMENT TO DISBAND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER,
GAVIRIA, SAID THAT THERE ARE 140 OF THEM.  THIS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT
KNOWS THEM.  THE FARC IS DEMANDING THE PURGE OF PEOPLE FROM THE ARMY COMMAND
INVOLVED IN THE DIRTY WAR, THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER BE A CIVILIAN, THAT THE
STATE OF EMERGENCY BE REVOKED, AND THAT THE ROAD TO REAL DEMOCRACY BE OPENED.

   [POSLEDNI] BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN NEGOTIATING WITH PARTISANS FROM
M-19.

   [CEPEDA] THE EL TIEMPO NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED
THEM REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT BY THEIR INCLUSION AS CANDIDATES OF THE
LIBERAL PARTY.  THIS IS TO INVOLVE FOUR SEATS AS LONG AS M-19 LAYS DOWN ITS
ARMS AND DISBANDS.  THE OTHER PARTISANS BITTERLY CRITICIZED THIS AS A BLOW
AGAINST THE UNITY OF THE MOVEMENT WHICH WILL BE ABUSED FOR PROPAGANDA
PURPOSES.  AT THE SAME TIME, M-19 REPRESENTS ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THE
MOVEMENT.  IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DIVIDE THE PARTISANS.

   [POSLEDNI] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TOOK PLACE IN
DECEMBER.  HOW DID IT REACT TO THE SITUATION?

   [CEPEDA] THE PARTY CALLED FOR PEACE AND OUTLINED THE STRUGGLE FOR A
PLURALIST GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION TOWARDS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  AT THE END
OF FEBRUARY THERE WAS A CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION WHICH DISCUSSED THE DIRTY
WAR.  IT STATED THAT, IN SPITE OF THE TERROR, THERE HAD NOT BEEN WHAT HAD
HAPPENED IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, NAMELY,
MASS EMIGRATION.  TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSED NEW MEASURES, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION OF PART
OF THE PARTY TO THE UNDERGROUND.  WE WILL NOT ALL TRANSFER, BECAUSE NOW WE
MUST STRUGGLE FOR OPEN CONTACT WITH THE MASSES, REGARDLESS OF THE HUGE RISK
WHICH IS LINKED TO THIS.

   [POSLEDNI] WHERE IS THE PARTY SEEKING ALLIES?  

   [CEPEDA] COMRADE ANTEQUERA, AS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE UP, HAD ESTABLISHED
A NUMBER OF CONTACTS.  HOWEVER, HE WAS MURDERED, AND SENATOR SAMPER PISANO,
A POLITICIAN FROM THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED DURING THE
ASSASSINATION AT BOGOTA AIRPORT ON 3 MARCH.  THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE 32-YEAR-OLD PROSPECTIVE POLITICIAN OCCURRED THE DAY AFTER HE
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY.  HE ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT FOR
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE, FOR AN END TO THE DIRTY WAR WHICH, AS HE SAID, IS
NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, HE WAS NOT A CHANCE
VICTIM.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION COVERING
THE AIRPORT, WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY, WAS SWITCHED OFF.  THUS,
THEY WANTED TO PREVENT THE MURDERERS BEING FILMED.  ONE OF THEM DIED, THEY
LET THE OTHER THREE ESCAPE.  AT THE SAME TIME, BOGOTA'S CHIEF OF POLICE WAS
AT THE AIRPORT ALONG WITH ANOTHER 10 COLONELS AND A NUMBER OF POLICEMEN AND
PERSONAL BODYGUARDS.

   [POSLEDNI] HOW DID THE OTHER PARTIES REACT TO THE ASSASSINATION?

   [CEPEDA] A JOINT DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED BY THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST 
PARTY, THE UP, AND THE LIBERAL PARTY, ON WHOSE BEHALF THE FORMER PRESIDENT
TURBAY AYALA SIGNED.  IT DEMANDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DISBAND THE
PARAMILITARY SQUADS.  IT SHOWS THAT OPINIONS ARE BEGINNING TO DIFFER, EVEN
IN THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY.  THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO EMPHATICALLY
CRITICIZING THE BLOODBATH AND THE PASSIVITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, POINTING OUT
THAT THEIR LAST PRESIDENT, BETANCUR, CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE
PARTISANS.  THIS IS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE THE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE
NEXT YEAR.

   [POSLEDNI] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP MET WITH THE
PRESIDENT AFTER THE MURDER OF COMRADE FORERO.  WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

   [CEPEDA] IN THE CONVERSATION, WE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFENSE
MINISTER, GENERAL GUERRERO PAZ, TRAVELS AROUND COLOMBIA ACCOMPANIED BY THE
LEADER OF THE ULTRA-RIGHT WING, RETIRED GENERAL LANDAZABAL REYES, WHO IS
LEADER OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  WE ASKED WHY THESE TWO ARE TOGETHER.
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ANSWER US.  AT THE MEETING WE ALSO SAID THAT, UNLESS
THE DIRTY WAR STOPS, THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
HISTORY WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS.  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL BEING MURDERED.  UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT GIVES
US A GUARANTEE OF SECURITY, WE WILL NOT SACRIFICE MORE LIVES.

   [POSLEDNI] THANK YOU FOR THE INTERVIEW.

   CLANDESTINE, 25 APR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT] [COMMANDER
ROBERTO ROCA, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
GENERAL COMMAND] [EXCERPT] THE AMNESTY MENTIONED BY D'AUBUISSON
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE LEADER] IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE
REVIVAL OF SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SOUNDLY DEFEATED.  THIS
PROPOSAL IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES
AND, AS WE MAY GATHER FROM HIS STATEMENTS, ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS THE
PLANS OF THE NEW ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT,
WHICH WILL BE IMPOSED ON 1 JUNE, TO INTENSIFY THE WAR.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE READY TO FACE THE WARMONGERING MANEUVERS OF THE
TRUE REPRESENTATIVE OF ARENA DEATHS SQUADS WHO IS NOW TRYING TO CREATE A
TERRORIST STATE THROUGH NEW REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, SINCE ARENA WON
THE MARCH ELECTION FARCE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY
AWARE OF THE NEED TO CONFRONT SUCH REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.

   ARENA HAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER; IT IS OFFERING OLD AND FAILED TACTICS IN
THE FACE OF A NEW SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY; THAT IS, A SIGNFICANT CHANGE IN
THE BALANCE OF FORCES IN FAVOR OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE.  THIS WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY ENCOURAGE A STRUGGLE AS SOON AS THE NEW ARENA GOVERNMENT IS
INSTALLED.

   D'AUBUISSON AND ARENA WILL SCARE NOBODY WITH PLANS THAT ARE COMPLETELY
DETACHED FROM A GENUINE WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THE FMLN HAS
PRESENTED A PRUDENT PEACE PROPOSAL BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE
CURRENT BALANCE OF FORCES.

   IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT THE DEGREE OF
UNITY REACHED TO FACE ARENA'S PLANS WILL BE THE KEY TO COUNTER THE
REPRESSION THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA ARE ALREADY PROMOTING.

   QUITO, 25 APR 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE INSURGENT GROUP ALFARO LIVES, DAMN
IT (AVC) TODAY REAFFIRMED THE SUSPENSION OF ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES AND BLAMED
EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS FOR SEVERAL ATTACKS AND ASSAULTS THAT HAVE TAKEN
PLACE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  

   AVC SPOKESMAN PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC "IS A SERIOUS, RESPONSIBLE
ORGANIZATION.  WE HAVE PUT DOWN OUR WEAPONS; WE HAVE SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF
ARMED ACTIVITIES."

   IN MID-JANUARY, THE AVC SIGNED AN UNCONDITIONAL AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT
RODRIGO BORJA'S ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH IT PLEDGED TO GIVE UP ITS ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES AND REJOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE.

   HOWEVER, NEWS SOURCES BLAMED THE GROUP FOR 13 BANK ROBBERIES THAT HAVE
TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AND FOR A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON A
POLICE CHIEF, THE HOME OF AN ARMY GENERAL, AND BODYGUARDS OF DEFENSE
MINISTER GENERAL JORGE FELIX.

   LEON SAID THAT THESE ACTIONS WERE INTENDED TO UNDERMINE THE AGREEMENT
WITH THE GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE THE EXTREME RIGHT WING WANTS TO BLAME THE AVC,
WHICH IS NOW ENGAGED IN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES."

   THE AVC SPOKESMAN EMPHASIZED HIS CONVICTION THAT THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC
WAYS OF SOLVING THE NATION'S PROBLEMS.  HE DISCLOSED THAT IN THE PAST FEW
HOURS, THE AVC FORMED AN ORGANIZATION FOR POLITICAL DIALOGUE "SO THE
SOLUTIONS TO THOSE PROBLEMS WILL NOT REMAIN MERE GOOD INTENTIONS."

   PATRICIO LEON SAID THE AVC'S POLITICAL DIALOGUE ORGANIZATION WILL BEGIN
ITS ACTIVITIES BY SEEKING A CONSENSUS ON THE AMOUNT OF AN ANNOUNCED WAGE
INCREASE.

DUARTE SAID THIS AFTERNOON THAT PRESIDENT- ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
PEACE PROPOSAL DESERVES RESPECT AND THAT ONE MUST HOPE THAT IT WILL
PRODUCE RESULTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE
PRESIDENT MADE THIS STATEMENT AT COMALPA AIRPORT UPON HIS RETURN FROM
THE UNITED STATES.  HE ADDED THAT HE WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES TOMORROW,
EVEN THOUGH HIS CANCER HAS GROWN.  THERE HAS BEEN VERY NEGATIVE
SPECULATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH, BUT HE STATED THAT HE WILL
RESUME HIS DUTIES IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE TESTS I UNDERWENT INDICATE THAT THE LIVER
CANCER HAS GROWN.  IT HAS NOT SPREAD BUT IT HAS GROWN, WHICH ADDS TO THE
RISK.  I UNDERWENT A 5-DAY TREATMENT, AND I WILL HAVE TO RETURN AS SOON AS I
PASS THE PRESIDENCY ON TO MY SUCCESSOR.  I WILL RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL ON 2
JUNE FOR ANOTHER CHECKUP AND TREATMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHEN WILL YOU RESUME YOUR DUTIES?  

   [DUARTE] IMMEDIATELY.  I AM THE PRESIDENT AND AS SOON AS I SET FOOT ON
SALVADORAN SOIL, I RESUME MY DUTIES. [END RECORDING] 

   IN REGARD TO THE SEARCHES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT VARIOUS UNION
HEADQUARTERS, DUARTE SAID HE WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
WHICH THESE WERE CARRIED OUT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MUST
BE DEFENDED WHEN DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS TURN INTO LIBERTINISM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THE FREEDOM OF ALL
SALVADORANS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES, HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS, JOIN UNIONS, AND
WORK FOR THEIR ASPIRATIONS WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THAT ATTACK
DEMOCRACY.  ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THESE THINGS.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BASIC
POINTS I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL SECTORS UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE BEEN CREATING
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO THAT GRADUALLY WE WILL LEARN TO
LIVE FREELY IN A DEMOCRACY WHILE RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. [END RECORDING]

   ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED FRONT THAT ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
IS PROMOTING IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THIS
BENEFITS THE COUNTRY, IT DESERVES SUPPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POLICY FOR PEACE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT -- IN OTHER WORDS, BY ME. I
HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THIS, AND I HAVE TRIED TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  IT WILL NOW BE UP TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT.  I HAVE TO SHOW
RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT CRISTIANI, WHO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO
BEGIN HIS TERM IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH HE CAN PRESENT HIS IDEAS,
PROPOSALS, AND SOLUTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO FIND THE PATH TO PEACE. [END
RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT DUARTE DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PEACE PROPOSAL THAT WAS RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED BY ARENA BECAUSE, HE SAID, HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT, ADDING
THAT IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO QUESTION THE PROPOSALS AND EFFORTS OF THE NEXT
PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT ANY EFFORTS FOR PEACE MUST BE SUPPORTED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 APR 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED CHANGES IN THE
ARMY'S STRATEGY TOWARD URBAN TERRORISM AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE TO ISOLATE THE
NEW GOVERNMENT ABROAD.

   CRISTIANI SAID: "WE MUST ADJUST OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY STRATEGY AND
MODIFY LAWS TO ALLOW US TO PROFESSIONALLY COUNTER THE FMLN'S STRATEGY."

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY MORNING, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND
MEMBER OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PRESENTED THE BASIC
VIEWPOINTS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT
NAPOLEON DUARTE'S ADMINISTRATION ON 1 JUNE.

   AS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS MAKING THIS STATEMENT, HE LEARNED ABOUT THE
ASSASINATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO.  [SENTENCE AS
PUBLISHED] ALVARADO WAS KILLED BY A BOMB PRESUMABLY PLACED BY AN URBAN
GUERRILLA GROUP ON TOP OF HIS ARMORED VEHICLE AS IT STOPPED AT AN
INTERSECTION IN SAN MIGUELITO NEIGHBORHOOD, NORTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE FMLN IS ABANDONING "GUERRILLA WARFARE TACTICS IN RURAL AREAS AND
INCREASINGLY RESORTING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN FRONTS IN THE MAIN
CITIES AND TO URBAN TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE (THE
GOVERNMENT).  AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO
ELICIT NEGATIVE REACTION TOWARD THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO ISOLATE US POLITICALLY
FROM THE WORLD," CRISTIANI SAID.  VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO
ACCOMPANIED HIM.

   HE ADDED: "OBVIOUSLY, IF WARRANTED BY THE SITUATION, WE MUST RESORT TO
LEGAL MECHANISMS.  SHOULD THE SITUATION BECOME DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO
CONTROL, OUR HARSHER MEASURE WOULD BE TO DECLARE A STATE OF SIEGE."

   SINCE EARLY APRIL, THE FMLN HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT A STRONG OFFENSIVE
AGAINST PRIVATE COMPANIES AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AND HAS STEPPED UP SABOTAGE
ACTIONS AGAINST TELEPHONE AND ELECTRICITY NETWORKS.

   IN ADDITION TO THE ATTACK ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THERE WERE OTHER
ATTACKS, IN WHICH GUERRILLA DESERTER MIGUEL CASTELLANOS AND FRANCISCO
PECORRINI, BOTH OF WHOM WERE RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES, WERE KILLED AND CARLOS
MENDOZA, CHIEF EDITOR OF ANALISIS MAGAZINE, WAS WOUNDED.  CASTELLANOS AND
PECORRINI WERE CONNECTED WITH THAT MAGAZINE.

COUNTRY THROUGH STREET VIOLENCE.  COL PONCE SAID MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
UNCOVERED THE PLAN, WHICH INVOLVES SEVERAL UNIONS AND MASS
ORGANIZATIONS.  ACCORDING TO COL PONCE, THERE WILL BE VIOLENT ACTIONS
IN THREE DEPARTMENTS: SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL.  THE
UNTS [NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN UNIONS], THE UNIVERSITY OF EL
SALVADOR, THE MPTL [BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND LIBERTY MOVEMENT], AND A
[WORD INDISTINCT] SHOCK GROUP, WILL LEAD THE ACTIONS.

   PONCE SAID HE IS REVEALING THIS TO KEEP THESE ACTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE.
HOWEVER, HE SAID, IF THEY ARE CARRIED OUT, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE
BEEN TAKEN.  HE ADDED THE REBELS PLAN TO BURN VEHICLES, DESTROY STORES, BOMB
TELEPHONE LINES, AND STEP UP SABOTAGE OF ELECTRICITY LINES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] TO ACCOMPANY THESE VIOLENT MASS ACTIVITIES, THEY
PLAN TO ATTACK THE MARIONA JAIL.  WE KNOW THE UNTS WILL PAY 7 COLONS TO
EVERY PARTICIPANT IN A DEMONSTRATION.  THEY ARE ALSO SPONSORING A
DEMONSTRATION AT A CAMP FOR DISPLACED PERSONS.  HONEST PEOPLE CAN REST AT
EASE; THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL MEASURES
TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS.  WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TAKING SOME
ACTIONS TO COUNTER ANY VIOLENT ACTIONS THEY MAY CARRY OUT ON 1 MAY. [END

   LIMA, 28 APR 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, CAN YOU GIVE US ACCURATE
INFORMATION ON THIS CLASH?

   [GARCIA] I CAME HERE [REGION OF LOS MOLINOS, 8 KM NORTHEAST OF THE CITY
OF JAUJA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT] WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND WITH THE
PRESIDENT OF THE JOINT COMMAND TO OBSERVE THE SITE OF A CLASH THAT
OCCURRED THIS MORNING, WHEN AN ARMY PATROL COMING FROM JAUJA AND HEADING
FOR JULCAN INTERCEPTED TWO VEHICLES CARRYING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY
ARMED SUBVERSIVES.

   ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, BASED ON THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM THE
SUBVERSIVES, THEY WERE HEADING FOR CONCEPCION, WHICH THEY WERE PLANNING TO
ATTACK. FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE ARMY AT THIS PLACE.

   WE HAD 6 DEATHS, AMONG THEM A LIEUTENANT, WHILE MORE THAN 60 SUBVERSIVES
DIED.  A TOTAL OF 47 FAL RIFLES AND SUBMACHINE GUNS WERE RECOVERED.  THEY
WERE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEY CARRIED KNAPSACKS WITH BOMBS.  THEY HAD VEHICLES
AN COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.  

   WE CAME HERE TO SUPPORT THE ACTION BY THE ARMY, BECAUSE THE ARMY NEEDS
OUR SUPPORT, AND TO LET THE ENTIRE COUNTRY BECOME AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS
OF THE SITUATION AND OF THE MAGNITUDE AND INTENSITY OF THE STRUGGLE THAT THE
ARMED FORCES ARE NOW WAGING IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND OF THE NATION.

   I BELIEVE THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT AND THE LOSS OF OUR SOLDIERS AND
OFFICERS SHOULD MAKE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AWARE OF THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US SHARE IN THE ANTISUBVERSIVE STRUGGLE.

   ALL THE FORCES OF THE STATE AND ALL THE ARMS OF THE NATION HAVE BEEN
PLACED UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS, OF THE
JOINT ARMED FORCES COMMAND, TO FIGHT AND TO ERADICATE THIS TERRIBLE THREAT
OF SUBVERSION. SUBVERSIVE VIOLENCE HAS CAUSED DEATH, MATERIAL LOSSES,
UNCERTAINTY, FEAR, AND INSECURITY, AND A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, IS THERE INFORMATION ON THE GROUP TO WHICH THE
SUBVERSIVES BELONG?

   [GARCIA] ACCORDING TO THE FIRST REPORTS, THEY BELONG TO THE SELF- STYLED
TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT [MRTA].

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TWO PASSPORTS IN YOUR HANDS.  WHAT DO
THEY SAY?  WHERE WERE THEY ISSUED AND TO WHOM DID THEY BELONG?

   [GARCIA] IDENTIFICATION PAPERS WERE FOUND ON ALMOST ALL SUBVERSIVES,
ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE FORGED.  THESE TWO BOLIVIAN [AS HEARD] PASSPORTS,
HOWEVER, ARE AMONG THE PAPERS THAT SEEM TO BE LEGITIMATE.  THESE PASSPORTS
MARK THE ARRIVALS AN DEPARTURES OF PERSONS WHO, AS WE CAN SEE, HAVE MISUSED
THE RIGHT TO ENTER PERU.  IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE OTHER FOREIGNERS AMONG THE
DEAD SUBVERSIVES.  ACCORDING TO AN INITIAL EVALUATION, MANY OF THOSE WHO
ATTACKED THE TOWN OF JUANJUI 1 1/2 YEARS AGO MIGHT BE AMONG THE DEAD.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, WERE THE OWNERS OF THOSE PASSPORTS THE LEADERS
OF THE SUBVERSIVE GROUP?

   [GARCIA] NO, WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THEY WERE THE LEADERS, BUT THEY WERE
THE PERSONS TO WHOM THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED.  

   [REPORTER] ARE THERE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD SUBVERSIVES?  

   [GARCIA] ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE OFFICERS, THERE
MIGHT BE CHIEFS AMONG THE DEAD.  

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] JUST A FEW, PERHAPS TWO OR THREE, BECAUSE OF THE ARM BANDS THEY
WERE WEARING.

   [REPORTER] THE GENERAL TOLD US THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE HARSHEST BLOWS
THAT THE ARMY HAS DEALT TO SUBVERSIVES.  

   [GARCIA] IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BLOWS, AND IT WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE THE
LAST ONE.  WE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND AND WE
FULLY SUPPORT ITS ACTION.

   IT IS VERY DEPLORABLE, DRAMATIC, AND TRAGIC THAT THIS DRAMATIC EVENT
SHOULD CONVEY THE IMAGE OF PERU TO OUR OWN FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND POSSIBLY TO
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, SHOULD DEFEND ITSELF.  IT IS BOTH
NECESSARY AND IMPERATIVE THAT WE END THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THROUGH THE
MILITARY POWER OF THE NATION AND THROUGH THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH
WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.

   THIS HAS BEEN A HARD BLOW, BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST ONE OF THE HARD BLOWS
THAT THE POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES DEAL UNTIL THIS THREAT IS TOTALLY
ELIMINATED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
LAUNCHED A MILITARY OPERATION IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH INCLUDED VEHICLE
SEARCHES, TO PREVENT A "TERRORIST" PLAN THAT TRADE UNIONS WILL SUPPOSEDLY
CARRY OUT TOMORROW FOLLOWING GUERRILLA ORDERS.

   THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND MILITARY POLICE ARE PATROLLING THE CAPITAL BY
LAND AND AIR, CONTROLLING THE ENTRANCES TO SAN SALVADOR, AND HAVE INCREASED
SEARCHES OF VEHICLES AND BUSES FOR WEAPONS.

   THIS OPERATION TAKES PLACE ON THE EVE OF A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OFFENSIVE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW, WHEN LABOR UNIONS
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER
CITIES COMMEMORATING INTERNATIONAL LABOR DAY.  

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) HAS TELEVISED WARNINGS
ACCOMPANIED BY VIDEO CLIPS SHOWING STREET RIOTS, RAIDS ON BUSINESS
ESTABLISHMENTS, AND BURNING OF VEHICLES.

   THE ARMY'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WORKERS' MARCH WAS PRECEDED BY RAIDS OF
FOUR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN SALVADOR AND THE ARREST OF SOME 100 MEMBERS
OF HUMANITARIAN AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ON CHARGES OF POSSESSING WEAPONS,
EXPLOSIVES, AND "SUBVERSIVE" PROPAGANDA.

   LEADERS OF THE MAJOR OPPOSITION UNIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS WARNED
TODAY THAT THE THREATS AGAINST THE MARCH "REFLECT AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION"
BY THE FUTURE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) GOVERNMENT BEFORE ITS
1 JUNE INAUGURATION.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, ARENA STATED THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE EXPECTED IN
MAY "IS BASED ON PLANS BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT TO DESTABILIZE AREA
GOVERNMENTS."

   THE GUERRILLAS HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WILL START A MILITARY OFFENSIVE
TOMORROW TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE THAT COULD LEAD TO A
POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.

   THE MAIN SALVADORAN LABOR UNIONS DENIED THE CHARGES MADE BY THE ARMED
FORCES AND HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR CALLS TO THEIR MEMBERS TO MARCH FOR "PEACE
WITH JUSTICE, WORK, AND LIBERTY."

   A WAR OF WORDS HAS BEEN LAUNCED ON THE MEDIA, WHICH BROADCASTS CALLS FROM
THE ARMY ASKING WORKERS NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARCHES, WHILE UNIONS URGE
THEIR MEMBERS TO COMMEMORATE THE CHICAGO INCIDENTS AT THE END OF THE LAST
CENTURY.

   MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY ASKED THE
ARMY TO "ACT CALMLY AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE" AGAINST THE TRADE UNIONS.

   "WE HOPE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT SILENCE THE WORKERS' LEGITIMATE CLAMOR FOR
MORE JUSTICE AND PEACE," ROSA CHAVEZ SAID.

   THE PRELATE SAID THAT "LABOR AND PEASANT GROUPS WILL MARCH PEACEFULLY,"
AND THAT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR CONFRONTATION, BUT DEMANDING JUSTICE AND
PEACE.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, THE GUERRILLAS -- THROUGH "FRONT
ORGANIZATIONS" -- WILL CARRY OUT VIOLENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS SABOTAGES ON
COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, BANKS, DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC VEHICLES
IN SAN SALVADOR, SANTA ANA, AND SAN MIGUEL.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 1 MAY 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN WORKERS TODAY
DEMANDED THE EXPULSION OF U.S. TROOPS AND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS FROM THE
COUNTRY, AND THEY DEMANDED HIGHER WAGES, MEASURES TO CONTROL INFLATION,
AND THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS.

   THE ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING WAS MORE MARKED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE
LEFTIST UNITED FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (FUTH), WHO BURNED EIGHT U.S.
FLAGS.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS ALSO BURNED A COFFIN SYMBOLIZING THE BURIAL OF THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT (AID).  THEY ALSO BURNED A SCALE MODEL OF THE U.S. PALMEROLA
MILITARY BASE IN CENTRAL HONDURAS.  

   THE HONDURAN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HELD SEPARATE MARCHES.  THOSE OF THE
RIGHT ENDED THEIR DEMONSTRATION AT THE CENTRAL SQUARE, IN FRONT OF THE
STATUE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN, WHILE THOSE OF THE LEFT
ENDED THEIR MARCH IN FRONT OF THE MANUEL BONILLA NATIONAL THEATER.

   THE CONSERVATIVE CONFEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (CTH) AND THE GENERAL
WORKERS FEDERATION (CGT) ALSO CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S.  TROOPS AND OF
MORE THAN 10,000 NICARAGUAN CONTRAS IN THE COUNTRY.

   "YANKEES GET OUT OF HONDURAS," "CONTRAS GET OUT," "TO PAY THE FOREIGN
DEBT IS TO KILL THE PEOPLE," AND "JOBS AND NOT MORE MILITARY AID" WERE SOME
OF THE SLOGANS ON PLACARDS AND BANNERS CARRIED BY THE WORKERS.

   THE SPEAKERS FROM THE MAIN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS DEMANDED THAT PRESIDENT
JOSE AZCONA'S GOVERNMENT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AMEND THE LABOR CODE, REFORM
THE SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE, AND RESPECT THE
RIGHT TO WORK AND JOB SECURITY.

   "WE WANT A FREEZE ON PRICES OF STAPLES, HOUSING PROGRAMS, RESPECT FOR
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT," CTH SECRETARY GENERAL
VICTOR ARTILES SAID.

   THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS STRESSED THAT THERE CAN BE NO PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN 1.2 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND A POPULATION WITH
DEFICIENT HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FOOD SERVICES.

   THEY ALSO SAID THEY ARE AGAINST THE SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS TO HONDURAS AND
AGAINST THE CREATION OF NEW MILITARY UNITS.  

   FUTH PRESIDENT HECTOR HERNANDEZ SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS NOT ONLY FACING
CONSTANT PRESSURE TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY BUT ALSO DAILY PRESSURE TO DEVALUE
OUR DIGNITY AS A NATION."

   HERNANDEZ CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS AND THE CONTRAS, AND HE
SAID THAT "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MAKE US PAY FOR A FOREIGN DEBT WE DO
NOT OWE."

   "THAT DEBT WAS PAID A LONG TIME AGO, AND WE MUST ASK WHETHER IT IS THE
DEVELOPED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES THAT OWE US BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOTING OF OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES," HE ADDED.

   OSCAR ANIBAL PUERTO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HONDURAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE
COMMITTEE (CODEH), SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES, AND NOT THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT, IS THE ONE THAT ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLICY GUIDELINES.

   PUERTO CONDEMNED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH
ILLEGAL ARRESTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE.

FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE WORKING
CLASS LIVING IN A SITUATION OF TOTAL POVERTY AND MISERY.  IT WILL BE A
JOURNEY OF STRUGGLE FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.
IT WILL BE A GREAT EFFORT TO CREATE A GREAT AND BROAD NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN
WHICH THE MOST VARIED POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES WOULD
CONVERGE TO BEGIN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS -- BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMY ON ONE SIDE, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON THE
OTHER -- TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BRING A JUST PEACE AND WILL THUS
OPEN UP A STAGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY,

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS
TODAY DENIED HAVING CARRIED OUT A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A U.S. EMBASSY
WAREHOUSE IN SAN SALVADOR, AN ATTACK OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE BLAMED ON THE
GUERRILLAS.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES IN TUESDAY NIGHT'S ATTACK.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORT TODAY THAT URBAN GUERRILLAS THREW TWO EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES FROM A VEHICLE AT THE SAN JORGE WAREHOUSE, A U.S.  EMBASSY FACILITY
IN THE SAN ANTONIO ABAD NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.  

   A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
THE ATTACK WAS "A CRUDE MANEUVER BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHICH WILL BE GOVERNING EL SALVADOR AS OF 1
JUNE, TO COMPLICATE THE GUERRILLA DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT."  THE REBEL
SOURCE CONFIRMED AN FMLN DECISION FIRST ANNOUNCED 3 MONTHS AGO THAT NO U.S.
DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC FACILITY IN EL SALVADOR WILL BE CONSIDERED A MILITARY
TARGET.

   AN FMLN DELEGATION WILL MEET TODAY IN NEW YORK WITH UN ASSISTANT
SECRETARY ALVARO DE SOTO AND PERMANENT UN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FRG,
CANADA, AND SPAIN.  MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC GUERRILLA
DELEGATION, WHICH OBTAINED UNRESTRICTED VISAS, WILL ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT.  THE GUERRILLAS WILL ALSO ASK THE UNITED NATIONS
TO REMAIN ALERT TO THE SITUATION AND TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE FUTURE ARENA
ADMINISTRATION -- TO BE HEADED BY RIGHTIST ALFREDO CRISTIANI -- TO ENSURE
THAT IT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS.

   LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO, AN ARENA
MEMBER, DESCRIBED THE REBEL DELEGATION'S U.S. VISIT AS "DANGEROUS AND
RIDICULOUS."  "I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNITED STATES COULD GRANT
VISAS TO TERRORISTS," ALVARENGA SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S
DENIAL OF A VISA TO EXTREME RIGHT-WING DEPUTY ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS
BEEN LINKED TO THE DEATH SQUADS.

   THE DELEGATION, WHOSE U.S. VISIT WILL LAST MORE THAN 8 DAYS, IS HEADED BY
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MIGUEL SAENZ, AND COMMANDER MERCEDES DEL CARMEN LETONA,
ALSO KNOWN AS "LUISA."

   U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS HAD DESTROYED THE CAMERAS OF THE LOCAL NEWSCAST
"UP TO DATE," WHOSE REPORTERS ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE SCENE OF THE

WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE IN TEGUCIGALPA] [TEXT] [REPORTER]
[PASSAGE OMITTED] ...FOR PEACE.

   [CRISTIANI] PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS NOT HAD THE LUCK OF STRIKING A
RESPONSIVE CHORD IN THE SALVADORAN MARXIST GUERRILLAS.  WE HOPE THAT WITH
NEW EFFORTS AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL FORCES WE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEACE.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO BE SEEN IN ITS FULL DIMENSION:  IT IS PART OF A
REGIONAL PROBLEM, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE [CENTRAL AMERICAN] PRESIDENTS
HAVE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THIS INTERNAL CONFLICT AT THEIR MEETINGS.

   [REPORTER] I HAVE A QUESTION ON BILATERAL RELATIONS.  WILL YOUR
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE RULING BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE [ICJ] AT
THE HAGUE REGARDING THE DEMARCATION OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS?  

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST BEGIN TO RESOLVE ALL THE
DIFFERENCES THAT OUR TWO COUNTRIES MAY HAVE HAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THIS
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT AZCONA.  CONTRARY
TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST SEEK A SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEMS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CONTINUE
IMPROVING A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED.

   WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT THE PEACE PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE AGREEMENT TO TAKE THE MATTER TO
THE ICJ FOR RESOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] INTERNATIONAL REPORTS STATE THAT VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED IN EL
SALVADOR SINCE YOUR PARTY WON THE ELECTIONS.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU
TRIED TO CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS OR ARE YOU GOING TO
WAIT FOR THE SITUATION TO DETERIORATE EVEN FURTHER?  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TAKE
POWER?

   [CRISTIANI] THE MARXIST GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR HAS PUBLICLY
ADMITTED THAT IT IS INCREASING ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY IN AN
ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY
VIOLENCE; I BELIEVE THE VICTORY OF OUR PARTY IN THE RECENT ELECTIONS DID NOT
REPRESENT MORE VIOLENCE.  VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MERINO HEADED THE DELEGATION
THAT MET WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN MEXICO, AND FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SEEK, VIA A DIALOGUE, A
SOLUTION TO OUR CONFLICT.

   NATURALLY, WE CANNOT YET ACT AS A GOVERNMENT, AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  ONCE OUR
ADMINISTRATION IS IN PLACE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE GREATEST EFFORT TO
SEEK A DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] ARE YOU PLANNING TO ASK THE UNITED STATES FOR AN INCREASE IN
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID?

   [CRISTIANI] NO.  DURING OUR RECENT TRIP TO WASHINGTON, ALL WE SAID IS
THAT WE TRUST THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE IN FAVOR OF THE
STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  ON THIS OCCASION WE BENEFITTED
FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT GENERATE, A PRIORI, ANY
PREJUDICE AGAINST THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THAT COULD RESULT IN A
MODIFICATION OF U.S. AID TO OUR COUNTRY.

   WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR ANY INCREASE IN AID.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD
DEVELOP OURSELVES AND HAVE EL SALVADOR BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING.  WE HOPE THAT
WITH THE HELP OF THE LORD WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] NOT
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAINTAIN OUR FRIENDSHIP, BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT EL SALVADOR CAN BECOME SELF-SUPPORTING.  

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT] [CRISTIANI] FRANKLY, I WAS SURPRISED BY
THIS STATEMENT BY DANIEL ORTEGA.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE HAS BASED HIS
OPINION ON.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS THE RESULT OF MEETINGS THAT HE MIGHT
HAVE HAD WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] WHO HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM NICARAGUA.  HOWEVER, AS WE HAVE JUST
REITERATED, OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE WITH THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
UNDER WAY SINCE ESQUIPULAS II WAS SIGNED, AND TO SEEK DEMOCRACY AND PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA BY MEANS OF A JOINT EFFORT BY OUR COUNTRIES.

   [REPORTER] IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE NEXT SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD IN OUR COUNTRY IN JUNE.  YOU ARE SLATED TO ATTEND
BECAUSE YOU WILL BE INAUGURATED ON 1 JUNE.  WHAT POSITION WILL EL SALVADOR
TAKE AT THE MEETING, AND TO WHAT EXTENT HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT COMPLIED WITH
THE COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS? [CONTINUED]

ALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT
GOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE [APRA
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALAN GARCIA] I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE
MUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT.

   WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE
CAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE.  I HAVE SEEN
POLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT
PERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE
WORK.  WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST
OUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM.

   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND
WITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL
RENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO
PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION.  THE MURDER OF
ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS.

   THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS.  WE MUST
FORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
ELECTIONS.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE
ARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF
THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE MUST MAKE
THIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]

THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST
THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, LEAVING 40 PERCENT
OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHILE INTERMITTENT
BLACKOUTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE ENTIRE EASTERN ZONE OF THE COUNTRY WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY TODAY,
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE
COMMISSION (CEL), WHICH STATED THAT ON MONDAY, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL STRUCTURES IN THAT REGION.

   THE REPORT ADDED THAT THE SABOTAGE OCCURRED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, WHERE OTHER STRUCTURES WERE ALSO BLOWN UP EARLY THIS MORNING.
IN THIS CAPITAL, FMLN URBAN COMMANDOES BLEW UP AT LEAST THREE POLES
SUPPORTING SECONDARY LINES, AND AN AS YET UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF POLES AND
TOWERS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGION.

   IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW ATTACKS AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, ON MONDAY
THE CEL STARTED A TURBOGAS PLANT IN THE EASTERN CITY OF SAN MIGUEL TO
PARTIALLY SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S ENERGY CRISIS.

   MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR COLONEL CARLOS GUZMAN SAID THAT THE

NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) WILL TAKE POWER.

   COL GUZMAN ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HAS DISCOVERED
"PLANS TO MURDER" ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS AND FUTURE ARENA

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 MAY 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY
BRIGADE IN SAN MIGUEL, BY STATION CORRESPONDENT SORTO] [TEXT]
CONCERNING A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WHICH INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES ARE
ATTRIBUTING TO A CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN
OPERATION CONCERNING ATTACKS AGAINST SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WE INTERVIEWED COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO
VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE STATIONED IN SAN
MIGUEL.  WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SORTO] COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL
OR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE?

   [VARGAS] I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL
OPERATION.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS,
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
MILITARY UNITS.  IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS
ABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE
INFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS.  THEY HIT SOME
FUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A
FIRE.  HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO
CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS.

   [SORTO] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] CLAIMS IT
SEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE.

   [VARGAS] EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED.  AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE
WAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE.  I THINK THESE
ARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST
FIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS
ARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS
HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT
HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.  THESE
ARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST
FIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE.  I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT
DO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY.

   [SORTO] DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA?  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA.  THE TRUTH IS THAT
AT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED.  AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY
ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR
WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.  THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

   [SORTO] YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL.  SOME OF THE MARKET
VENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD.

   [VARGAS] YES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS
OR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY
CHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES.  THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL
SHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY.  THE PEOPLE OF THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR
ABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE.  THE
FMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS.

   [SORTO] THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  

   [VARGAS] WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  WE
HAVE REPORTS THAT IN SAN ILDEFONSO, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT -- SOUTH OF
CABANAS -- THERE WERE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NATIONAL GUARD -- WHICH WE
SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY -- REPORTED SOME CATAPULTS HAD
BEEN FIRED.  HOWEVER, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED, AND I HAVE NO REPORTS OF ANY
ACTION IN OTHER PLACES.

   [SORTO] TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY.  

   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, GREETINGS TO ALL MOTHERS:  HAVE FAITH AND
HOPE THAT YOUR SONS ARE HERE -- FROM THE GENERAL TO THE LAST SOLDIER --
AND THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE WORKING FOR YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE
PEACE AND TRANQUILITY YOU NEED AS MOTHERS TO GENERATE LOVE AND COURAGE FOR
EACH OF YOUR SONS.  ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR SONS, THE SOLDIERS, TO ALL
MOTHERS OF THE EASTERN AREA AND OF EL SALVADOR: RECEIVE LOVE AND KISSES.

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE.

   THE REBEL STATION ADDED THAT ANOTHER THREE CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON
TROOPS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 3, WHO WATCH OVER THE TOWN OF ANAMOROS IN
THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF LA UNION.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN ASSERTED THAT ONE GUERRILLA WAS KILLED DURING THE
ATTACK ON MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHIRILAGUA, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.

   A FUEL PUMP WAS DESTROYED BY SHRAPNEL FROM EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HURLED BY
GUERRILLAS AGAINST A GARRISON OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERED IN
SAN MIGUEL, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY.

   COLONEL MAURICIO VARGAS, COMMANDER OF THE 3D BRIGADE, SAID THE REBEL
ATTACKS ARE "ACTIONS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS AND ARE
TREACHEROUS AND COWARDLY ACTS BECAUSE THE REBELS ARE AFRAID TO FACE THE
SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY POWER."

   VARGAS SAID THE REBELS DID NOT INFLICT CASUALTIES ON OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO
THE GARRISON.

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO ATTACKED THE SOLDIERS GUARDING TWO COFFEE MILLS IN
SANTIAGO DE MARIA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.  THEY DID NOT INFLICT ANY CASUALTIES.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED THAT THE REBELS DESTROYED THE MUNICIPAL OFFICE,
A GASOLINE STATION, AND THE CIVIL DEFENSE POST IN EL CONGO, SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENT.

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES, THREE MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED CIVIL
DEFENSE WERE WOUNDED WHEN THEIR POST WAS ATTACKED IN A VILLAGE NEAR METAPAN,
SANTA ANA DEPARTMENT.

   A MILITARY SOURCE ADDED THAT A TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICE WAS DESTROYED
AND FIVE HOUSES DAMAGED BY EXPLOSIVES IN AGUILARES, IN SAN SALVADOR'S
NORTHERN SUBURB.  

   THE REBELS SAID THEY ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CHALATENANGO, SAN
VICENTE, LA PAZ, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN, CENTRAL, AND
NORTHWESTERN EL SALVADOR, RESPECTIVELY, WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY CASUALTIES ON
GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 MAY 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[HORACIO GIBEOLA] [TEXT] THE LATEST COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT.  IT SHOWS THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT'S PRECARIOUSNESS.  UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD
ITS LUKEWARM ELECTION PROMISES, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A COMPLETELY
DEFENSIVE POLICY.  HARASSED BY ATTEMPTED COUPS, GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION,
ADMINISTRATIVE INEPTNESS, AND INSURGENT ACTIVITIES, CEREZO'S
ADMINISTRATION IS PLAGUED BY EVIDENT INSTABILITY.  HIS GOVERNMENT IS
STILL HOSTAGE TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH TEMPORARILY
SURRENDERED POWER AFTER MANY YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.

   NEVERTHELESS, CEREZO IS THE VICTIM OF MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT
AWAY FROM POSITIONS OF GREATER POWER BY THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS.  THIS SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE MOST RECENT PLOT AGAINST THE CIVILIAN
GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT, MASTERMINDED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS, WAS CRUSHED BY
OFFICERS WHO DECIDED TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FOR THE TIME BEING.

   GUATEMALA, 85 PERCENT OF WHOSE POPULATION LIVES IN POVERTY, IS PLAGUED BY
PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT SPREAD PANIC, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE PEASANT AND
INDIAN POPULATION, IN COLLUSION WITH THE POWERFUL AND WELL-ARMED ARMY.
ANOTHER SIGN OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INCREASING WEAKNESS IS THAT IMPORTANT
DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH DOMINATES KEY
ECONOMIC SECTORS.

   CEREZO'S POWER WAS THREATENED A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT
GUATEMALAN FORCES FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN STAGING JOINT COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATIONS WITH U.S. SOLDIERS.  THIS PARTICIPATION CASTS DOUBTS ON CEREZO'S
ALLEGED ACTIVE NEUTRALITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TURNS GUATEMALA INTO JUST
ANOTHER SPRINGBOARD FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES AS PART OF THE
SO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY WAR.  ACCORDING TO THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, WAR EXERCISES ARE STAGED IN GUATEMALA WITH TROOPS FROM
THE U.S. BASES IN THE PANAMA CANAL AREA.  ON 31 JANUARY, A U.S. PILOT FLYING
A U.S. PLANE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO LAND AT THE GUATEMALA CITY AIR
FORCE BASE.  THE REBELS ASSERTED THE PLANE WAS HIT BY ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE.  IN
ADDITION, U.S. TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN GUATEMALA'S CHIMALTENANGO DEPARTMENT
IN NOVEMBER 1988.

   SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDER OF 22 PEASANTS LAST FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS
NOTICED FLIGHTS NEAR THE SCENE OF THE MASSACRE BY U.S.  AIR FORCE CHINOOK
HELICOPTERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS OR IN MISSIONS
TO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY.  

   THE MOST RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN GUATEMALA AND THE DISCOVERY OF AN
INCREASING PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THAT COUNTRY HAS PLACED CEREZO'S
GOVERNMENT IN A SERIOUS, DIFFICULT POSITION.  CEREZO SEEMS TO BE FORCED TO
OBEY A SOCIETY MADE UP OF PEOPLE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN HIM.

   LIMA, 14 MAY 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PERUVIAN POLICE TODAY ARRESTED 10
PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HAVING DETONATED A CAR BOMB SOME 300 METERS FROM
GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND HIS FAMILY WERE SLEEPING.

   THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE POWERFUL SHOCK WAVE DESTROYED WINDOWS AND
DOORS IN A 400-METER RADIUS, BUT NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED.

   THE POLICE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT (MRTA).  THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT 0150 (0650 GMT) ON BLOCK NO. 3
ON ANCASH STREET, IN FRONT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MONASTERY AND THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF CULTURE.

   WITNESSES TOLD POLICE THAT THEY SAW THREE WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN
ADANDONING THE CAR, APPARENTLY ACTIVATING THE BOMB BY REMOTE CONTROL SOME
100 METERS AWAY.  THE SUSPECTS THEN FLED IN ANOTHER CAR THAT WAS AWATING
THEM.

   THIS IS THE SECOND CAR BOMB PLANTED BY THE MRTA SINCE 7 MAY, WHEN THE
TERRORIST GROUP BLEW UP ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THE SAN MARTIN MILITARY
QUARTERS, AN ARMY ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT LOCATED IN THE LIMA DISCTRICT OF
MIRAFLORES.

   THE MRTA, WHICH HAS DETONATED ABOUT 20 CAR BOMBS, BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN
1984.  TWO WEEKS AGO, THE ARMY SHOT 65 MRTA MEMBERS IN A CLASH IN JAUJA, IN
THE CENTRAL MOUNTIAN REGION.

   IN RELATED DEVELOPMENTS, THE DEPARTMENTS OF PASCO, JUNIN, AND HUANUCO
RETURNED TO NORMAL TODAY AFTER A 72-HOUR "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED BY THE MAOIST
TERRORIST GROUP THE SHINING PATH.  TRADE, MINING, AND BANKING ACTIVITIES IN
THESE IMPORTANT ANDEAN DEPARTMENTS WERE COMPLETELY PARALYZED DURING THE
STRIKE.

   ONE ARMY OFFICER AND A CIVILIAN DIED, 5 POLICEMEN AND 2 CIVILIZANS WERE
INJURED, AND SOME $20 MILLION WAS LOST IN PROPERTY DAMAGE DURING THE STRIKE.

   THE MAIN PERUVIAN MINES OF LEAD, SILVER, ZINC, GOLD, AND COPPER ARE
LOCATED IN THESE THREE DEPARTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MINEWORKERS
OBSERVED THE STRIKE OUT OF FEAR OF SHINING PATH RETALIATION.

   ASUNCION (PARAGUAY), 16 MAY 89 (ABC COLOR) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX BY ABC COLOR REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] DOES YOUR PRESENCE HERE SIGNALS THE CREATION OF A
KIND OF CONTINENTAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT, SIMILAR TO THE FRONT OF MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS OF THE PAST?

   [LARCO COX] YES.  THE PRESENCE HERE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE
GROUP OF 8, WITH JUST ONE EXCEPTION, WAS AGREED DURING A PREVIOUS
CONVERSATION IN WHICH WE DECIDED THAT PARAGUAY MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE
THAT IT DESERVES FOLLOWING THE RECENT ELECTIONS THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF
THE PEOPLE.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN?  

   [LARCO COX] IT MEANS THAT THE PARAGUAYAN OPPOSITION WAS ABLE TO PERFORM
ITS SUPERVISORY ROLE WITHOUT OBSTACLES, AND THAT THE PROCESS WAS OBSERVED
BY INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS, WHO MADE USE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO
GUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] YOUR REMARKS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE
PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIGHTING A GUERRILLA FORCE THAT JEOPARDIZES THE
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

   [LARCO COX] RIGHT.  IN PERU WE ARE FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  IT IS A
WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE WORLD IS RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED DURING AN ANTISUBVERSIVE ACTION.  YET THERE IS
LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DEFEND DEMOCRACY,
WITHIN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST DEFEND ITSELF.  IN THIS CONTEXT THE
SUBJECT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT WELL DEFINED.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU MEAN THAT A MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS AT TIMES MORE
EFFECTIVE?

   [LARCO COX] NO.  IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE FOR REPRESSION, BUT I MADE IT
CLEAR THAT SUBVERSION IN A DEMOCRACY IS UNJUSTIFIED AND THAT DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  IF THERE ARE ANY HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN A DEMOCRACY, THEY STEM FROM EXCESSES BY THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS SIMPLE.  IN A DICTATORSHIP, REPRESSION IS WIDESPREAD
AND ALMOST ALWAYS ARBITRARY, AND THERE IS NO ONE TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [REPORTER] IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALAN GACIA HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT THERE
IS A LIMIT TO WHAT A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAN DO.  IN FACT, HE IS YOUNG,
HANDSOME, AND HE IS A GOOD SPEAKER.  HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE
PROBLEMS.  WHAT DOES PERU NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE MUCH DESIRED
STABILIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS?

   [LARCO COX] PERU NEEDS ECONOMIC STABILITY, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
EXPERIENCE AND WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO DISTRIBUTE WEALTH.  THE
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WAS DONE DURING THE FIRST 2 AND 1/2 YEARS.  THE
NEGATIVE SIDE OF THIS IS THAT DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION WAS OVERSTIMULATED.
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM CONTRADICTORY, OUR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS NEEDED
MORE IMPORTED MATERIALS IN ORDER TO INCREASE LOCAL PRODUCTION.  THIS LED
TO A DANGEROUS DECREASE IN OUR RESERVES.  SIMULTANEOUSNLY, THE BANK
NATIONALIZATION LAW WAS SET IN MOTION.  THIS PROVIDED THE PERFECT
FRAMEWORK FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM.  THERE WAS ALSO THE EARLY
START TO THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FINALLY THE RADICAL OPPOSITION BY THE
BUSINESS SECTOR OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GROWTH IN THE CRIME RATE AND THE COSTLY
PROCESS OF FIGHTING THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IN
URBAN TERRORIST ACTIONS.  THIS COULD EASILY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
PERUVIAN DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS, RIGHT?

   [LARCO COX] QUITO TO THE CONTRARY.  DEMOCRACY WILL BE PRESERVED EVEN IF
THE NORMAL HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION BECOMES THE ONLY
OBJECTIVE OF THE RECENTLY INSTALLED CABINET.  THIS, HOWEVER, WILL BECOME
THE SOLE OBJECTIVE ONLY IN AN ESTREME SITUATION.  THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY OTHER
OBJECTIVES, BUT I WANT TO STRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT WE ATTACH TO THE
HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE WINNER OF CLEAN ELECTIONS, WITH GUARANTEES FOR
ALL OPPOSITION PARTIES.  THIS IS HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE
PRESERVED AND THIS IS HOW THIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTAIN ONE OF ITS MAIN
TARGETS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] A U.S. HELICOPTER USED TO
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CRASHED THIS EVENING WHEN TRYING
TO LAND AT THE MILITARY AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, SEVERAL PASSENGERS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING
U.S. PERSONNEL, WHO WERE TAKEN TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL IN GUATEMALA CITY.  

   ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, THE U.S.
AIRCRAFT WAS BEING USED TO HELP CARRY FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO TOWNS THAT ARE
HARD TO REACH.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS SENT BY GUERRILLA GROUPS TO GUATEMALAN NEWSPAPERS --
WHICH HAVE PUBLISHED THESE REPORTS -- THESE FLIGHTS ARE ALL PART OF THE
MILITARY SUPPORT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SUBVERSIVES.

   THERE IS NO INFORMATION YET ON THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT INVOLVED IN THE
ACCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED WHEN "IT LOST POWER" BEFORE LANDING, ACCORDING TO
INITIAL REPORTS.  U.S. ARMY "CHINOOK" HELICOPTERS ARE USED IN GUATEMALA FOR
VARIOUS OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN GUATEMALA CITY AND AREAS FAR DISTANT
FROM THE CAPITAL.  

   THIS IS THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OCCURRING IN RECENT MONTHS.  A
GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE (FAG) "PILATUS" AIRPLANE CRASHED SOME MONTHS AGO IN
CHIMALTENANGO PROVINCE, AND ITS PILOT DIED IN THE ACCIDENT.  A FAG
HELICOPTER RECENTLY PLUNGED INTO THE PETEN ITZA LAKE, LOCATED IN NORTHERN
GUATEMALA; TWO CREWMEN DIED AND TWO SURVIVED THE ACCIDENT.

   THE ARMY'S OFFICIAL VERSION REPORTED THAT THESE ACCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY
BAD WEATHER OR MECHANICAL FAILURE.  GUERRILLA REPORTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN
PUBLISHED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, SAY THAT THE AIRCRAFT WERE SHOT DOWN BY THEIR
ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAY 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [EXCERPTS]
GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS ATTACKED THE HOME OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO TODAY AT NOON, KILLING A
NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER GUARDING THE HOUSE.

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 1330 AND WAS ALLEGEDLY PERPETRATED
BY GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS.  DURING THE ATTACK, NATIONAL POLICE
OFFICER FIDEL SANCHEZ SANCHEZ WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  HE WAS TAKEN TO A
MILITARY HOSPITAL BY MEMBERS OF ALVARENGA'S SECURITY POLICE.  ALVARENGA WAS
HAVING LUNCH IN HIS HOME WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS GUARDING HIS HOME WERE
ATTACKED.

   WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT FOUR YOUTHS IN A RED PICKUP TRUCK SHOT AT
THE POLICEMEN FROM A DISTANCE OF 20 METERS.  THIS LED TO AN EXCHANGE OF
GUNFIRE, ALARMING RESIDENTS IN THE COLONIA MIRAMONTES AREA.

   ALVARENGA ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] OF
BEING DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE
FACT THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING 100 HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.  ALVARENGA ADDED THAT THE INSURGENTS' ATTITUDE HAS DEFINITELY
CLOSED THE DOOR ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THIS EVACUATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALVARENGA] IT CANNOT BE.  TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, I
INSIST THAT THESE HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  IF
THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, ALL OF THEM, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER ALLOW THESE
HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE, THEN WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THAT
TYPE OF ACTION.  WHY NOT TAKE THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN MAIMED OUT OF THE
COUNTRY?  SO MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MAIMED BY BOMBS!  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
AT LEAST ONE SALVADORAN CHILD BE TAKEN TO A LARGE HOSPITAL IN GERMANY.  

   IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES.  AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?
TELL ME, HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF HUMANITARIAN ACTS WHEN OUR SALVADORAN CHILDREN,
OUR YOUTH ARE BEING MAIMED?  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT WE WILL PREVENT GUERRILLA COERCIVE ACTIONS.  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
CANNOT PREVENT THIS.  WHAT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATE.  WE NEED TO LEGISLATE A
BIT MORE TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE SECURITY.  IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FMLN
AND, FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS ELEMENTS IT WISHES TO DESTROY... [CHANGES
THOUGHT] LOOK, THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  THIS IS TRUE.  I DO NOT WANT IT TO
HAPPEN, BUT THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  BUT OTHERS LIKE RICARDO ALVARENGA WILL COME
FORWARD. [END RECORDING]

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE ON BERNAL AVENUE IN COLONIA MIRAMONTES, A FEW
MINUTES AFTER ALVARENGA ENTERED HIS HOME.  ALVARENGA SUFFERED NO INJURIES.
THE FMLN HAS NOT YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   CLANDESTINE, 24 MAY 89 (RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] STATES:

   1.  BY REJECTING OUR PROPOSAL AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE ELECTIONS INTO A
PATH TO ACHIEVE PEACE, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] TURNED
THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS INTO A PROCESS OF WAR.

   2.  ARENA WILL ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED ONLY BY THE VOTES OF A
MERE 18 PERCENT OF VOTING-AGE SALVADORANS, WHICH MAKES IT AN ILLEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT AND A GOVERNMENT OF MINORITIES FOR MINORITIES.

   3.  EVER SINCE ELECTION RESULTS WERE REVEALED, THERE HAS BEEN A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE FORM OF
ARRESTS, MURDERS, SEARCHES, RAIDS ON LABOR AND ASSOCIATION OFFICES, ATTACKS
AGAINST UNIVERSITIES, AND SO ON.

   4.  ARENA IS ALREADY ANNOUNCING, AND IN MANY CASES ALREADY IMPLEMENTING,
ANTIPOPULAR MEASURES SUCH AS THE FORMATION OF DEATH SQUADS UNDER THE NAME OF
PATRIOTIC CIVILIAN DEFENSE, THE ANNULMENT OF DECREE 207, DEVALUATION OF THE
CURRENCY, PRIVATIZATIONS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE OF SIEGE, AND OTHER
MEASURES THAT WILL HURT THE PEOPLE.

   5.  ARENA'S POLICY TOWARD THE EVACUATION OF PEOPLE MAIMED IN WAR SHOWS
THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL FURTHER DEHUMANIZE THE WAR.

   6.  AS A FIRST REPLY OF OUR FRONT TO THE ARENA GOVERNMENT, THE GENERAL
COMMAND DECREES A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING AT DAWN ON 31
MAY.  THE MEASURE MUST BE COMPLIED WITH ON ALL HIGHWAYS OF THE COUNTRY AND
IN THE CITIES.  WE URGE ALL OUR UNITS TO ENFORCE THIS DECREE AND OUR PEOPLE
TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE STOPPAGE TO REPUDIATE THE DEATH SQUAD'S
GOVERNMENT AT THE VERY MOMENT OF ITS INAUGURATION.

SANCHO, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, LEONEL GONZALEZ, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] OUR
ARMY IS ESSENTIALLY THE PEOPLE'S ARMY, BECAUSE IT WAS BORN OF THE
PEOPLE.  THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS OF WAR, HUNDREDS OF COUNTRYMEN
HAVE SPILLED THEIR BLOOD FOR THE LAND ON WHICH THEY TOIL TO ACHIEVE
JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE'S MOST HEARTFELT DESIRES.  IN THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE ENEMY, WE HAVE COMMITTED ERRORS IN MILITARY PROCEDURES
THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CASUALTIES AMONG THE PEOPLE.  TO QUICKLY AND
RADICALLY CORRECT THESE REGRETTABLE PROCEDURAL ERRORS, THE FARBUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND ORDERS ALL
COMMANDERS AND COMBATANTS OF OUR MILITARY UNITS TO STUDY AND IMPLEMENT
THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, WHICH MUST BE STRICTLY FULFILLED:

   1.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MUST POPULATED AREAS BE MINED.  MINES MUST BE
PLACED WHERE ENEMY TROOPS TRAVEL.  ALL PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN HIGHWAY
AMBUSHES SO THE MINES WILL ONLY AFFECT ENEMY PATROLS AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES.

   2.  IN THE PLANS TO ATTACK ENEMY GARRISONS, THE COMMANDERS MUST ALWAYS
EVALUATE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION'S SITUATION.  EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
CARRY OUT CLEAN ATTACKS.  IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY, EVEN AFTER ALL
ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED, THAT PERSONS HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
ENEMY WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE ATTACK IS CARRIED OUT, THE OPERATION MUST BE
SUSPENDED.

   3.  BEFORE PUNISHING THE OWNERS OF PRIVATE VEHICLES AND BUSES WHO VIOLATE
THE PROVISIONS OF THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, OUR UNITS MUST BE ABSOLUTELY
SURE THE OWNER VIOLATED THE PROVISION.

   4.  IN CARRYING OUT SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHO WOULD
BE AFFECTED BY THE ACTION.  TO THE SAME EXTENT OUR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS MUST
BE IMPLACABLE WITH THE REGIME AND THE OLIGARCHY, THOSE OPERATIONS MUST NOT
AFFECT WORKERS, SMALL OWNERS, PEASANTS, OR THE LOWER CLASSES.

   5.  BEFORE CARRYING OUT EXECUTIONS, AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION MUST BE
CONDUCTED UNTIL IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE TARGET OF THE OPERATION IS AN ENEMY
OF THE PEOPLE.

   6.  ALL OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE EXECUTIONS, MUST BE
PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED SO AS TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH THE ENEMY'S DIRTY WAR
PROCEDURES.

   EVERY FMLN COMBATANT MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE
PEOPLE AND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. THEREFORE,
WE MUST ACT CONSISTENT WITH THIS REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE.

EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW, QUOTE,
TERRORIST OR GUERRILLA GROUP, UNQUOTE, OUTBREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HE
MADE THIS STATEMENT REFERRING TO THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES
LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

   TO REMIND THE PEOPLE OF THIS CASE, DURING THE EVENING OF 24 MAY TWO U.S.
CITIZENS, WHO BELONGED TO A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, WERE MURDERED BY A
SELF-STYLED ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION [FAL] GROUP IN DOWNTOWN
LA PAZ.

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THIS ALLEGED ORGANIZATION THAT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER, HAS NO TIES WITH THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH
TERRORIST GROUP.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PEREZ BELTRAN] TO THIS MOMENT, AND DUE TO THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CASE, I DO NOT DARE TO ADMIT THE EXISTANCE OF ANY
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO TERRORIST GROUPS. IF THE SHINING PATH IS
OPERATING IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS IN FACT SHINING PATH
THAT IS COMMITTING THESE CRIMES.

   WE CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY IN THE
1960'S, WHEN IT DID NOT HIDE ITS IDENTITY. THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP.
THEY ARRIVED IN BOLIVIA WITHOUT HIDING THEIR INTERNATIONAL IDENTITY, AND
THERE ARE MANY BOLIVIANS WHO CAN TELL US ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY.

   NOW, IF THIS CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH, THEN IT WAS
COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH AND NOT BY THE ZARATE WILKA GROUP. I DO NOT
WANT TO DISCARD THIS POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT AS
SOMETHING VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. OUR OBLIGATION, AS MEMBERS OF THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IS TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OBVIOUS, FULLY
VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. [END RECORDING]

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SELF-STYLED
FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP AND OF SHINING PATH MEMBERS IN BOLIVIA IS DOUBTFUL,
BECAUSE IN THE CRIMINAL CASES RECORDED IN COCHABAMBA AND IN ORURO RECENTLY,
THE POLICE DISCOVERED THAT COMMON CRIMINALS, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE LINKED TO
THE WORLD OF DRUG ADDITION AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
THOSE CRIMES.

   REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES IN LA PAZ LAST WEDNESDAY,
THE INTERIOR MINISTER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN DETAINED, BUT THAT THE
INVESTIGATIONS BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTINUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT] 

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] NO. WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF A TERRORIST
GROUP IN BOLIVIA.  

   [REPORTER] AND WHAT ABOUT THESE MURDER CASES?

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] I DO NOT KNOW. MANY PEOPLE CAN BE HIDING BEHIND THIS
ZARATE WILKA GROUP. WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ZARATE WILKA GROUP.
WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL LEANINGS, OR WHAT PARTY IS
BEHIND THIS GROUP. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COMMON CRIME, OR MAYBE NOT.

   BUT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND SAY: YES, THIS GROUP LAST NIGHT
MACHINEGUNNED THESE PEOPLE, THAT THEY ESCAPED, ETC. THIS WOULD MEAN A VERY
IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE AS
SERIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT CAUSE THE PEOPLE TO PANIC.

   WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY. WE SHOULD UNITE OUR FORCES, ALL
COALITION PARTIES, THE RULING PARTY, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE ARMED FORCES,
THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND ALL BOLIVIANS, TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS WOULD
REPRESENT A REAL BOLIVIAN STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO INTEND TO DISRUPT OUR
PROCESS OF LIBERTY, TO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OF THE
FATHERLAND. [END RECORDING]

BOTH HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED.  

   JUAN SIERRA, A HONDURAN ARMED FORCES SOURCE, TOLD REUTER: "WE ARE CERTAIN
THERE WERE CLASHES, BUT THE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER."

   THE HONDURAN RADIO STATION RADIO AMERICA, QUOTING A FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SOURCE, SAID AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF
CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS WERE KILLED WHEN SALVADORAN TROOPS ENTERED HONDURAN
TERRITORY ON SATURDAY.  

   THE FMLN, QUOTED BY RADIO AMERICA, SAID THE FIGHTING IN THE HONDURAN
DEPARTMENT OF INTIBUCA, ON THE PLAINS NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER, LASTED 4
HOURS.  DURING THE FIGHTING, A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER BOMBED HONDURAN
CIVILIANS, KILLING OR WOUNDING A NUMBER OF THEM, THE FMLN SAID.

   RADIO AMERICA SAID:  "WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF DEAD AND
WOUNDED.  (THE FMLN) ONLY SAID IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT CIVILIANS WERE KILLED
OR WOUNDED IN THE CLASH."  

   THE TROOPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY CLASHED AT THE BORDER AS THE
RESULT OF TENSION CAUSED BY TERRITORIAL DISPUTES AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE
PRESENCE OF LARGE CONTINGENTS OF SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS NEAR THE BORDER.  THE
TWO ARMIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY HELD JOINT ANTIGUERRILLA OPERATIONS.  ON ONE
OCCASION, SALVADORAN SOLDIERS ATTACKED HONDURAN TROOPS, MISTAKING THEM FOR
REBELS.  

   THE TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES REACHED ITS PEAK DURING THE
SO-CALLED SOCCER WAR IN 1969, WHEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOUGHT FOR 100 HOURS

   CLANDESTINE, 28 MAY 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] AT 1400 ON 27 MAY,
SPECIAL HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED SAN ANDRES AND TIERRA AGRIA, SAN
GERARDO JURISDICTION, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, WHEN ARCE BATTALION
TROOPS WERE CARRYING OUT AN OPERATION IN THE AREA.  THEY CLASHED NEAR
EL CHENGUE HILL AND ALONG THE SHORES OF TOROLA RIVER.  DURING THIS
CLASH, WHICH LASTED 4 HOURS, ARCE BATTALION WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO
ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTERS, A HUGHES 500, AND A A-37 PLANE.

   SALVADORAN TROOPS SUSTAINED NUMEROUS CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A WOUNDED ARCE
BATTALION OFFICER.  HONDURAN TROOPS WERE PUSHED BACK AND CORNERED IN LOS
LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA JURISDICTION, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, HONDURAS.  ARCE
BATTALION LANDED TROOPS FROM FOUR HELICOPTERS IN THAT VILLAGE.  AN HONDURAN
HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS EVACUATING CASUALTIES, WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM
INTO HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER, WHICH FIRED ROCKETS AND
MACHINEGUNS.

   ARCE BATTALION, WHICH SURROUNDED HONDURAN TROOPS IN LOS LLANITOS,
CAPTURED AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF PRISONERS.  IN THIS CLASH, RESIDENTS OF
THE SAN ANDRES, [WORDS INDISTINCT] CANTONS, AND RESIDENTS OF LOS CASTANOS,
LOS LLANITOS, AND LA CEIBITA WERE ROCKETED AND MACHINEGUNNED BY SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.  

   THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT PARTIALLY DESTROYED HOMES AND ANIMALS THAT WERE
KILLED.  WE ARE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE NAMES OF THE WOUNDED AND DEAD
AMONG AREA RESIDENTS.

   WE URGE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE SERIOUSNESS AND
REPERCUSSIONS OF THESE CLASHES.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY'S
POLICY OF INVOLVMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR.  

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAD WARNED THAT
HONDURAN TROOPS' COOPERATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR,
FOLLOWING A U.S. DECISION, WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A CLASH BETWEEN THE TWO
ARMIES.  IT IS A SECRET TO NOBODY THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE REACHED POWER
WITH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
PROMOTED THE INVASION OF HONDURAS IN 1969 AND THAT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE AT THE TIME FOR MASSACRES, RAIDS, AND ABUSES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  

   WE BELIEVE HONDURANS MUST THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BECAUSE THIS LEVEL
OF CONFRONTATION WITH INFANTRY TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT WILL SET THE TONE OF THE
CONFLICT FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE BORDER CONFLICT OF A GOVERNMENT OF
OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED AN EXPANSIONIST POLICY TOWARD HONDURAS.  

   ONCE AGAIN, WE CALL ON THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO STOP THEIR ARMY'S
INVOLVEMENT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S WAR [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN EL SALVADOR, ITS
MAIN ENEMY.  

   WE CALL ON THE NATIONAL AND INTERNAL PRESS, ESPECIALLY HONDURAN MEDIA, TO
VISIT LOS LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, TO CONFIRM THESE
SERIOUS INCIDENTS.  WE CALL ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THE
INJURED CIVILIANS.

MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] POLITICAL
PROPOSAL TO THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   THE 1 JUNE SWEARING-IN OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA]
GOVERNMENT MEANS THE WORSENING AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL
SALVADOR.  MEASURES CONDUCIVE TO INCREASING REPRESSION, LEGALIZING DEATH
SQUADS POSING AS CIVIL DEFENSE UNITS, GIVING TOTAL IMMUNITY TO DEATH SQUAD
MEMBERS IMPLICATED IN MURDERS SUCH AS THAT OF MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO, WORSENING
SOCIAL CONFLICT WITH THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ABOLITION OF FLEDGLING ECONOMIC
REFORMS, AND DISMISSING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EN MASSE CREATE A CLIMATE TOTALLY
UNFAVORABLE TO TALKS BETWEEN THE SIDES.

   IN THE LIGHT OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ONCE AGAIN MAKES A NEW EFFORT AND PROPOSES
A PRACTICAL WAY TO OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF TALKS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT
MAY LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR:  

   1.  RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE FMLN FEELS POLITICAL
PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE ARENA GOVERNMENT MAY PLAY THE ROLE OF
SPONSORS AND NEGOTIATORS OF THE DIALOGUE UNTIL DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IS ACHIEVED.  DURING THE OAXTEPEC MEETING, THE
POLITICAL PARTIES ESTABLISHED THE NEED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS PAST 19 MARCH.
THE FMLN DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE NOW TO REAFFIRM THIS NEED AND TO BEGIN TALKS
AT A MUTUALLY AGREED ON PLACE AND DATE.  DURING THESE MEETINGS BETWEEN THE
OPPOSITION PARTIES THE FMLN, WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING PLATFORM OF
COMMITMENTS WE FEEL THE FMLN AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT AS MEASURES
CONDUCIVE TOWARD CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE AND DIRECT
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SIDES:

   2.  POLITICAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FMLN:  

   A.  TO ABSTAIN FROM ANY FORM OF ATTACK AGAINST POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  

   B.  TO SUSPEND NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES AND THUS SUSPEND
SABOTAGE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

   C.  TO RESPECT THE LIVES, FREEDOM, AND WELL-BEING OF RELATIVES OF
POLITICAL LEADERS AND OFFICERS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES AND
TO RESPECT THEIR RESIDENCES.

   D.  TO CONTINUE TO REFRAIN FROM USING ARTILLERY-EQUIPPED PLATFORMS, KNOW
AS CAR BOMBS.  

   E.  TO RESPECT U.S. PERSONNEL AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN EL SALVADOR.  

   F.  TO SUSPEND SABOTAGE OF URBAN POWER POLES AND SHOPPING CENTERS.

EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS BLAMED THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MORMON
MISSIONARIES ON NARCOTERRORISTS, WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL
CONNOTATION.  "DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME, AND
THEY WANT TO GIVE IT POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS," PEREZ SAID.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE MRUDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES MIGHT BE A "COPYCAT
MURDER" DONE WITH THE INTENTION OF BLAMING THE "ZARATE WILKA GROUP WITH
HAVING DONE IT."  HE ADDED THAT THE GROUP IS NAMED AFTER A PEASANT LEADER
WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY.  THE PEASANT HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION
WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY WE CAN NOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT
GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME,
LEFT A HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEIR WAR IS TO KILL "THE
YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS."

   REFERRING TO THE MESSAGE LEFT AT THE SCENE, THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID
THAT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MESSAGE REVEALS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN
LANGUAGUE NOT COMMONLY USED BY A LEFTIST POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.  THE
MESSAGE IS VAGUE WHEN IT REFERS TO BOTH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE
EXPLOITATION OF PEASANTS.  THIS IS A CRIME IN WHICH DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT
BE INVOLVED AND TO WHICH THEY WANT TO ATTACH A POLITICAL CONNOTATION," PEREZ
SAID.

   PEREZ ADDED THAT IN RECENT DAYS "THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAVE COME TO BOLIVIA WITH PLANS TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE TO REJECT THOSE RUMORS."

   HE SAID THAT THIS CRIME IS IN NO WAY LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF "SHINING
PATH" TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA.  HE SAID: "IF THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS OPERATING
IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LIKE THE
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) DID IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY REVEALED THAT
THEY CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD."

   PEREZ STATED THAT MURDER OF THE U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES SHOULD BE
SERIUSLY ANALYZED SO THAT A RELIABLE REPORT IS RELEASED.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 2 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND HAS AGREED TO
"CONTINUE" THE DIALOGUE WITH THE NEW SALAVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS
SWORN IN YESTERDAY.  THE FMLN ALSO PROPOSES CHANNELS TO FOLLOW FOR
STARTING THE DIALOGUE.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) YESTERDAY PROPOSED TO THE GUERRILLAS THAT THEY
BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL END THE ARMED
CONFLICT IN THAT NATION.

   A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION "CAN LEAD TO PEACE IN EL SALVADOR," THE FMLN
ASSERTED IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED TODAY IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, AND SIGNED BY
COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN,
EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.  

   THE FMLN PROPOSES "COORDINATING A CEASE-FIRE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN
OVERALL NEGOTIATION OF THE CONFLICT," WITHOUT TRYING TO "APPLY THE SAME
MEANS USED IN THE CASE OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS."

   IN EXCHANGE, THE REBELS DEMAND "THE TRIAL OF FORMER MAJOR ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S MURDER,"
AS WELL AS "THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION" OF D'AUBUISSON FROM ANY GOVERNMENT
POSITION.  D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN
ARCHBISHOP'S ASSASSINATION, FOUNDED ARENA, WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE GUERRILLAS DEMAND "THE DISBANDMENT OF THE DEATH SQUADS." THEY ALSO
WANT THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE CREATION OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL
DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE REBELS REQUEST "THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE" OF LABOR
LEADERS, MASS MOVEMENT ACTIVISTS, AND DETAINED POLITICAL PRISONERS, AND THEY
DEMAND THAT MURDERS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF REPRESSION AGAINST
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES CEASE.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE REBELS ARE WILLING TO AGREE TO A
CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT "WHEN IT IS AGREED UPON AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER
INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION," AS WELL AS TO A MULTILATERAL CUTBACK OF MILITARY
SUPPLIES "OF ANY KIND TO ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS AND GROUPS
INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT."

   THE FMLN COMMAND PLEDGES THAT ONCE THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, IT
WILL "REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT"
AND FROM ENFORCING NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES.  THE FMLN OFFERS TO
"RESPECT THE LIVES AND LIBERTY" OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS'
RELATIVES, AS WELL AS TO "SUSPEND" THE USE OF CAR BOMBS IN THE CITIES.  

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING "U.S.  PERSONNEL AND
INSTALLATIONS IN EL SALVADOR" AND TO SUSPENDING ATTACKS ON THE ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM AND ON URBAN SHOPPING CENTERS.

   DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TALKS, THE GUERRILLAS POINT OUT, THE POLITICAL
PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA)
GOVERNMENT COULD PROMOTE AND ARRANGE THE DIALOGUE UNTIL "A DIRECT
NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN" IN PLACES AND ON DATES
"MUTUALLY AGREED UPON" IS ACHIEVED.

   THE INSURGENT LEADERSHIP WARNS THAT IF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES
DOES NOT TAKE PLACE, THE INAUGURATION OF THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL MEAN "THE
HEIGHTENING AND PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR."  

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ALSO PROPOSES THAT AGRARIAN REFORM BE CONTINUED.  THE
REBELS ALSO WANT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKING AND OF FOREIGN TRADE,
UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, AND RESPECT FOR THE COMMITMENT MADE BY
THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION TO "EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND MAIMED GUERRILLAS"
AND TO RESPECT THE LIVES OF RELATIVES OF THE LEADERS OF MASS MOVEMENTS,
OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND THE FMLN.

   LIMA, 4 JUN 89 (EFE) -- [EXCERPTS] IT WAS REPORTED HERE TODAY THAT OVER
5,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN SEVERAL SECTORS OF LIMA BY POLICE AND
MILITARY PATROLS FOLLOWING THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON 3 JUNE IN WHICH 7
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES WERE KILLED.  

   NEWS MEDIA REPORTED TODAY THAT DURING COMBINED OPERATIONS IN DOWNTOWN
LIMA AND ITS OUTSKIRTS, ABOUT 300 VEHICLES WERE DETAINED ON THE ROADS
LINKING LIMA WITH THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE POLICE AND MILITARY DETAINED ABOUT 5,300 PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HAVING
PARTICIPATED IN THE BOMBING OF THE BUS THAT CARRIED 24 SOLDIERS OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL ESCORT REGIMENT. THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ESCORT
REGIMENT, WHICH IS KNOWN AS "HUSARES DE JUNIN," TOOK PLACE SOME 10 BLOCKS
FROM THE GOVERNMENT PALACE.

   NO GUERRILLA GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.  PRESIDENT
ALAN GARCIA SAID, HOWEVER, THAT ACCORDING TO SOME POLICEMEN, THE TUPAC AMARU
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT [MRTA] COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK, ALTHOUGH
SHINING PATH INVOLVEMENT IS NOT RULED OUT.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, GARCIA SAID THAT THE TERRORISTS COULD HAVE
PERPETRATED THIS ATTACK IN RETALIATION FOR THE DEATH OF 60 MRTA GUERRILLAS
IN A CLASH WITH ARMY FORCES IN JAUJA, IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL MOUNTAIN
RANGE, IN APRIL.

   THE MURDER OF THE 6 SOLDIERS AND 1 POLICEMAN RAISED TO 36 THE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE KILLED BY TERRORISTS DURING THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF JUNE.  THAT IS AN
AVERAGE OF 12 DEATHS EACH DAY.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL JULIO VELASQUEZ GIACARINI TODAY TOLD THE PRESS

PERPETRATED BY PRESUMED GUERRILLAS.

   THE MINISTER AND HIS TWO BODYGUARDS DIED WHEN RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S RESIDENCE
IN SAN SALVADOR WAS MACHINEGUNNED.  

   ARENA DEPUTIES DID NOT DISMISS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE RULING PARTY MAY
WITHDRAW PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S DIALOGUE OFFER TO THE GUERRILLAS IF
IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)

DISMISSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT "OTHER GROUPS INTERESTED IN THE CONTINUATION
OF VIOLENCE" COULD HAVE PERPETRATED THE ATTACK.  THE DEPUTIES DID NOT
IDENTIFY THESE GROUPS.

   THUS FAR, NEITHER THE GUERRILLAS NOR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION HAVE CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF THE MINISTER, WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST

PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BY NELSON
LOPEZ] [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [COLINDRES] THE PDC [CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY] CONDEMNS THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENCY MINISTER DR
ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.  IT BELIEVES VIOLENCE WILL NOT SOLVE THE
COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS, IS NOT THE WAY TO SETTLE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES,
AND WILL NOT LEAD TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT.

   WE HOPE THIS CONDEMNABLE ACT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY AN ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE AND REVENGE THAT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER POLARIZE SALVADORAN
SOCIETY.  THE PDC EXPRESSES ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE REPUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT,
THAT IS, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, AND RODRIGUEZ' GRIEVING
FAMILY.  WE URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT, TO FIND A
POLITICAL AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFLICTING
OUR SOCIETY.  THIS IS THE PDC'S POSITION ON THE CONDEMNABLE ASSASSINATION OF
DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   [LOPEZ] DR COLINDRES, DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ESCALATION
OF VIOLENCE BY THE EXTREME RIGHT?

   [COLINDRES] WE HOPE REASON WILL PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS
OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE
THAT WOULD ONLY RESULT IN MORE BLOODLETTING AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY US.

   [LOPEZ] IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS ACTION INVOLVED LEFTIST URBAN COMMANDOS
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT POLITICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE?

   [COLINDRES] LET US WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE
BEEN THE FMLN OR ULTRARIGHTIST FACTIONS SEEKING FURTHER POLARIZATION AND
BLOODLETTING.  WE DO NOT WANT TO PASS JUDGMENT YET.  REGARDLESS OF WHO DID
IT, THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
AMONG SALVADORANS.  

   [LOPEZ] IN THE PDC'S OPINION, WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES
IN THE WAKE OF DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION?  

   [COLINDRES] I BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES MUST CONTINUE THEIR POLICY OF
PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THIS IMPLIES
RESPECTING THE LAW AND STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND CALM OF THE
ENTIRE POPULATION.

   [LOPEZ] WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING?  

   [COLINDRES] ONLY THAT WE HOPE THIS KIND OF REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE
INCIDENT WILL NOT BE REPEATED.  WE ALSO HOPE THAT VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION
AMONG SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL END ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]

   SAN PEDRO SULA, 9 JUN 89 (TIEMPO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] WHEN WE
ASKED THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WHY THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
PROTESTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ATTACKS ON HONDURAN ARMY
SOLDIERS AND A HELICOPTER IN LOS LLANITOS (INTIBUCA), THE ANSWER WAS
VERY SIMPLE, BUT IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE THAT IS GIVEN TO NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT INFORMED US OF
ANYTHING AT ALL -- THEY SAID -- AND WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS IS NOT
ACCURATE.

   THE NEWSPAPERS TIEMPO AND LA PRENSA PUBLISHED REPORTS OF THE INCIDENT
WITH PHOTOGRAPHS THAT CONFIRMED THE AGGRESSION, THE BOMBING AND SHELLING OF
VILLAGES IN OUR TERRITORY, AND PROVIDED ACCOUNTS BY EYEWITNESSES AND
MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES, BUT WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, LACK
CREDIBILITY OR IMPORTANCE.

   LATER FOREIGN NEWSMEN WENT TO THESE PLACES AND CONFIRMED WHAT TIEMPO AND
LA PRENSA HAD REPORTED.  THEY ALSO OBTAINED OTHER DETAILS ON THE INCIDENTS.
WHILE THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DENIED THE INCIDENT, DESPITE
THE EVIDENCE, THE TRUTH IS THERE FOR THE GENTLEMEN OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY
TO SEE.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS BY THE VILLAGERS WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE
SALVADORAN AGGRESSION, THE HONDURAN MILITARY THREATENED THEM AND ORDERED
THEM TO BE SILENT OR TO LIE ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR
THE SANTA LUCIA MAYOR TO INTERVENE BEFORE THEY COULD TELL NEWSMEN WHAT HAD
HAPPENED.  A REPORTER FOR LA PRENSA WAS SIDETRACKED BY A COMMANDER, NO DOUBT
TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING HIS JOB AS A JOURNALIST.

   THE HONDURAN ARMY'S WEAPONS SERVED TO KEEP THE AGGRESSION QUIET INSTEAD
OF REPELLING IT, TO THREATEN HONDURAN BORDER VILLAGERS INSTEAD OF
PROTECTING THEM, WHILE THE ARMY TURNED ITS BACK ON THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES
-- WHICH HAVE TRAMPLED ON OUR TERRITORY AND HUMILIATED US -- INSTEAD OF
FIGHTING THEM.  IN SHORT, THE WEAPONS THAT WE HONDURANS AND THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE OBTAINED WITH SO MUCH SACRIFICE, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOING
WITHOUT FOOD AND MEDICINE, ARE USED AGAINST HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE.  

   THIS SITUATION SHOULD CAUSE US TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE EXISTENCE OF
THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.  WE ANTICIPATED THIS WHEN THE REGIONAL MILITARY
TRAINING AND SECURITY CENTER (CREMS) WAS CREATED EXCLUSIVELY TO TRAIN 10,000
SALVADORAN TROOPS -- THE SAME ARMY THAT INVADED US IN 1969 AND THAT IS
ATTACKING US AGAIN.

   WE WONDER IF WE ARE NOT ACQUIRING A MERCENARY MENTALITY IN HONDURAS,
WHEREBY THE STATE'S WEAPONS GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER RATHER THAN BEING USED
IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST.  FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR
ECONOMIC -- THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY DISGUISED -- BENEFITS.

   NO NATIONAL MILITARY FORCE CAN FUNCTION LIKE THIS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IN ANY EVENT, THE IDEOLOGY OF ANY ARMY SHOULD BE NATIONALISTIC, EVEN IN THE
CASE OF POWERS AND SUPERPOWERS THAT INVENT AND USE INTERNATIONALIST
IDEOLOGIES FOR THEIR HEGEMONIC STRUGGLES.

   HERE IN HONDURAS THE CASE OF THE ARMED FORCES IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.  TO
THE MILITARY INSTITUTE'S WAY OF THINKING, THOSE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE
DEFENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY ARE SUBVERSIVES WHO ARE
ALLIED WITH SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  AN AGGRESSION AGAINST
HONDURAS BY A FOREIGN ARMY IS LEGITIMIZED BY THE PEOPLE ATTACKED AND THOSE
WHO INFORM AND PROTEST ARE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.

   THIS WAS STATED IN AN EDITORIAL OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' "MILITARY
PROJECTIONS" PROGRAM.  THE EDITORIAL SAID THAT THE REPORT WAS ISSUED
"WITHOUT PRIOR INVESTIGATION" AND WAS BASED SOLELY "ON INFORMATION PROVIDED
BY THESE GROUPS TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION."

   "THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF SOME PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA DIRECTORS HAS
REACHED THE POINT THAT THEY ARE PROMOTING THESE CLEARLY MARXIST - LENINIST
SUBVERSIVES, FINANCED BY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, AND THOSE WHO DO NOT HIDE THEIR
OPEN SYMPATHY WITH PSEUDO-PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS.  THEY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL
THIS BY CLAIMING THAT RADIO STATIONS OR NEWSPAPERS HAVE UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION."

   A SIMILAR EXPLANATION WAS PRESENTED BY THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY IN
TEGUCIGALPA IN A PRESS COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEDIA, WHICH PUBLISHED
AND DISSEMINATED IT -- ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS INCREDIBLE -- THROUGH THE
OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE BULLETINS.  WE MIGHT ADD THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY
HAS ECHOED SUCH REPORTS, AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO A PROPAGANDA PLOY TO COVER UP
AN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR COUNTRY.

   WE ASK, THEREFORE:  "WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS?  WHAT IS
HONDURAS?  WHO ARE HONDURANS?"

[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO] [TEXT] MR MINISTER
[HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS]: VARIOUS HONDURAN
PRESS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED ON THE 13 JUNE MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT AND LEADERS OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS, AMONG THEM ENRIQUE
BERMUDEZ, WHO HAVE BEEN USING HONDURAN TERRITORY AS A BASE AND
SANCTUARY FOR ITS CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST NICARAGUA.

   THESE MERCENARY GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST NICARAGUA,
ADDING NEW VICTIMS TO THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED
THE EFFECTS OF U.S. AGGRESSION AND THE PARTICIPATION AND COMPLICITY OF YOUR
GOVERNMENT WITH THAT ILLEGAL POLICY.

   THE WELL-KNOWN U.S. POLICY OF MAINTAINING CONTRA FORCES IN HONDURAN
TERRITORY AND ITS CONSTANT CRIMINAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
POPULATION -- WHICH HAVE LEFT 163 CIVILIAN VICTIMS SINCE THE COSTA DEL SOL
SUMMIT ON 31 MAY -- CHARACTERIZES THE TALKS BETWEEN U.S. GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND CONTRA LEADERS, AS WELL AS THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE LOSS
OF HUMAN LIVES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE IN MY COUNTRY.

   WHILE VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE WAS MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES, PASTORAL
REPRESENTATIVES IN WASLALA AND LAS MINAS INFORMED THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, KIDNAPPED, AND
TORTURED BY THE MERCENARY GROUPS THAT INFILTRATE NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS.  

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED ON THE CONTINUATION OF
ATTACKS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES, AMONG THEM ONE IN SAN JOSE,
TIJUANA, SOUTHEAST OF ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR PEASANTS
WERE KILLED ON 10 JUNE.  

   IN THE COSTA DEL SOL DECLARATION, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CARRYING OUT THE DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND
RELOCATION OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS CURRENTLY BASED IN YOUR COUNTRY.
HOWEVER, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED -- AGAINST THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE -- THE OPTION SET FORTH BY A U.S. BIPARTISAN
AGREEMENT AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CONTRAS IN HONDURAN TERRITORY.  

   INTERVIEWS WITH HONDURAN POLITICAL LEADERS, SUCH AS THE ONE PUBLISHED IN
THE DAILY LA TRIBUNA IN ITS 13 JUNE EDITION, CLEARLY STATE THAT THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO TO HONDURAS TO SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT TO
OBTAIN A CONFIRMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL NOT EXPEL THE CONTRAS
FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY.

   IN CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN ITS TERRITORY OF MERCENARY
FORCES -- WHICH WERE CREATED TO ATTACK MY COUNTRY -- THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT
IS NOT ONLY HELPING TO BRING MORE SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND NATION, BUT IS ALSO CONTINUING THE HEAVY BURDEN ON THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  

   WITH THIS BEHAVIOR, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN EVINCES ITS TOTAL
 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN
THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS, TO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO ATTACK
OTHER STATES AND TO DISCONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR IRREGULAR FORCES.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY PROTESTS THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNTRY
CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO CONDUCT ILLEGAL POLICIES THAT
GO AGAINST THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS AND THE PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO GUARANTEE THE
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES.

   YOUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFLECT ON THIS AND HEED THE CALLS MADE BY THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES, WHO DEMAND AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S INVOLVEMENT
IN AN ILLEGAL AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA
DEL SOL CALLING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOINT PLAN FOR THE
DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE IRREGULAR FORCES BASED
IN YOUR COUNTRY BE HONORED.

   I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REITERATE MY ESTEEM TO YOUR EXCELLENCY.

COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] CONCERNING DR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND REPORTS THE
FOLLOWING TO ALL SALVADORANS:

   1. AS A RESULT OF INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE CONDUCTED, WE CONFIRM THAT THE
FMLN BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR THE ATTACK ON DR RODRIGUEZ
PORTH.  WE DELAYED MAKING THIS STATEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO
CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR OTHER REASONS THAT COULD HAVE INVOLVED US IN THE ATTACK.

   2. FOLLOWING RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH, SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE CONDUCTED
MARKEDLY VENGEFUL ACTIONS.  COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS PROPOSED
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE.  FRANCISCO MERINO HAS THREATENED OPPOSITION LEADERS
WITH DEATH.  RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO HAS PROPOSED REPRESSIVE NEW LAWS.

   WE HEREBY WARN THAT IF REPRISALS ARE TAKEN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION
MOVEMENT, WE WILL TAKE FIRM AND RESOLUTE ACTION AGAINST ANY ESCALATION IN
REPRESSION.

   3. WE FIND THE FALSE COMMOTION AMONG THE RANKS OF THE ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY REPULSIVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS OF THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY IN KILLINGS LIKE THAT OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE FDR [REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND SO
MANY OTHERS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR ALLEGED INNOCENCE, AND DO EVEN
LESS AT A TIME WHEN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING INTENSIFIED.

   4. OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ
PORTH OCCURRED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INTENSE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE
ENTREPRENEURIAL SECTOR [OF ARENA] AND D'AUBUISSON'S SUPPORTERS TO
GAIN CONTROL OF THE PARTY, AND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DISPUTE FOR THE
DEFENSE MINISTRY.  IN THE LATTER CASE, RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ACTIONS DID AWAY
WITH GENERAL BUSTILLO'S ASPIRATIONS.  THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR THE LINE OF
CONDUCT OF ARENA FACTIONS AND FOR THESE INTERNAL CONFRONTATIONS.  WE RECALL
THE ATTACK THAT ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON PERPETRATED AGAINST FORMER U.S.
AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING.  WE ALSO REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT MEN CLOSE TO
MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION PARTICIPATED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF BUSINESSMEN.
MAJOR D'AUBUISSION'S SILENCE CONCERNING THE ATTACK ON RODRIGUEZ PORTH IS
NOTEWORTHY.

   THE FMLN UNDERSTANDS THE CONCERN OF THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT ARENA MAY USE THIS FACT TO JUSTIFY
IRRATIONAL RETALIATORY ACTIONS.  IF A SITUATION IS BROUGHT ABOUT, INVOLVING
AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AND EXPANSION OF THE WAR, IT WILL BE THE ARENA
GOVERNMENT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, NOT OURS.

   FOR THIS REASON, WE HAVE RAISED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES THE NEED TO
CREATE CONDITIONS FOR ESTABLISHING A FAVORABLE CLIMATE FOR DIALOGUE AND A
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.  WE REITERATE OUR TOTAL READINESS TO
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THIS EFFORT.  THE FMLN REASSERTS TO ALL THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO THE TRUTH AND THAT THAT WE WILL BE
FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AT ALL TIMES AND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

   SANTIAGO, 16 JUN 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY, THE CHILEAN MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF A SELECTIVE TERRORIST PLAN TO
ATTACK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, A PLAN THAT COULD BE LINKED TO THE SHINING
PATH, A PERUVIAN TERRORIST GROUP.  

   GENERAL OSCAR VARGAS, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT,
REPORTED ON THIS PLAN DURING A 2-HOUR CABINET MEETING THAT WAS CHAIRED BY
CHILEAN PRESIDENT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.  

   THE MINISTER SAID THAT THERE ARE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF SUCH A PLAN,
EMPHASIZING THAT THE CIVILIANS HAVE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SUBVERSION CANNOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE
OF CIVILIANS.

   GEN VARGAS POINTED OUT THAT THE RECENT ATTACKS ON ARMED FORCES AND THE
SECURITY SERVICES PERSONNEL, THE ROBBERY OF CARS -- ACCORDING TO THE POLICE,
A MILITARY TRUCK AND 18 PRIVATE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN STOLEN -- AND THE
STEALING OF CAR LICENSE PLATES AT THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE A CLEAR INDICATION
THAT THESE GROUPS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN THEIR ACTIVITIES.

   THIS WEEK, SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED AN ARMY NON-
COMMISSIONED OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
(CNI, THE SECRET POLICE) AND WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, AND LAST WEEK A
RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER WAS MURDERED.  

   THE MINISTER ADDED THAT A COORDINATION AMONG ALL THE TERRORIST GROUPS
THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE AREA HAS BEEN NOTICED, ESPECIALLY BY THE SHINING
PATH.  THIS MATTER WAS DISCUSSED BY THE PERUVIAN DEFENSE MINISTER IN A
SPEECH HE MADE IN LIMA LAST WEEK.

   CONCERNING THE MEASURES TAKEN, GEN VARGAS SAID: "ALL GOVERNMENT
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TAKE CARE."

   GEN VARGAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THE POSSIBILITY THAT GENERAL AUGUSTO
PINOCHET COULD RUN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 14 DECEMBER
1989 WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CABINET MEETING HELD TODAY AT THE LA MONEDA
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

   FOR HIS PART AND IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, A RIGHTWING
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGOVERNMENT NATIONAL
RENEWAL PARTY, SAID THAT HIS NOMINATION "WOULD NOT MAKE ANY SENSE IF
PINOCHET RUNS FOR THE SAME POLITICAL SECTOR."

   JARPA REITERATED THAT IF THE INCUMBENT, WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT SINCE
1973, WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, "IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REFORM THE 1980
CONSTITUTION" BECAUSE ARTICLE 25 PREVENTS THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT FROM SEEKING
RE-ELECTION.

SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY RENE HURTADO] [TEXT] HURTADO
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THIS MORNING DELIVERED PART OF THE COFFEE TAX,
WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN THE
COUNTRY.  AFTER THE EVENT AT A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, CRISTIANI ANSWERED
QUESTIONS, FIRST ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] COMMUNIQUE DENYING PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF PRESIDENCY
MINISTER JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE FMLN
FLATLY DECLARED THAT NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDER.  CRISTIANI HAD THIS TO SAY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND SAID THEY HAD
NOT ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION AND ADDED THAT APPARENTLY A GROUP GOT OUT OF
HAND AND PERPETRATED THE CRIME.  I THINK THE FMLN HAS REALIZED THE GENERAL
REPUDIATION THIS ACTION HAS ELICITED.  I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN IS TRYING TO
EXCUSE THE ACTION, THUS AVOIDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY.  WE THINK THEY ARE
TRYING TO SEEK A WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF AN
AGED, DEFENSELESS PERSON.  BUT THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM NOW.

   [HURTADO] THE FMLN HAS DENIED THAT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE
ACTION.

   [CRISTIANI] OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO DENY IT AFTER THEY LEARNED
OF THE REPUDIATION BOTH HERE AND ABROAD.  IN ADDITION, THEY WAITED A
CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DENY THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THEY HAD A COMPLETE PLAN
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  AS YOU KNOW, THE PLAN IS CALLED "ALL AGAINST ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]."  THIS MURDER WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN.
RODRIGUEZ PORTH HAD NO ENEMIES.  HE WAS A PEACEFUL MAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH
HIS PEN AND IDEAS. ONLY AN IRRATIONAL MIND, LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE VIOLENCE, COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THIS ACTION.  I AM CONVINCED THE
FMLN DID IT.

   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, IF YOU AND THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ARE CONVINCED
THE FMLN IS GUILTY, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE DIALOGUE?

   [CRITIANI] WE THINK WE SHOULD OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THIS HEAVY BLOW
CAUSED BY THE LOSS, NOT ONLY OF A COLUMN OF THE PARTY AND OF OUR IDEOLOGY,
BUT ALSO OF A PERSONAL FRIEND.  AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD
OVERCOME OUR GRIEF AND SEEK THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] VIOLENCE IS REPUDIATED AND REJECTED IN THE COUNTRY.  IT IS TIME
FOR THE FMLN TO TALK ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES.  THEY HAVE REJECTED THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNACCEPTABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE
ARGUMENTS.  BUT OUR PROPOSAL FOR DIALOGUE IS STILL GOOD.  WE ARE WILLING TO
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM SO THIS VIOLENCE CAN END.

   [HURTADO] HAS A COMMISSION ALREADY BEEN FORMED?  

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING IT.  SOME OF THE PROPOSED
PERSONS HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO BE MEMBERS.  WE HOPE TO HAVE FORMED THE
COMMISSION BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT, WE WILL GLADLY
ANNOUNCE THE MEMBERS' NAMES. [CONTINUED]

   SANTIAGO, 26 JUN 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] TERRORIST SERGIO
BUSCHMANN, WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY IN ALASKA, WAS SET
FREE BY U.S. AUTHORITIES.  THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS
FRUSTRATION OVER THAT DECISION, NOTING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE
ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY OCCASION TO BRING SERGIO BUSCHMANN TO
COURT IN CHILE.

   THE INFORMATION WAS MADE PUBLIC BY CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN
CARLOS DUCCI WHEN HE RELEASED AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE FROM THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUCCI] THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WAS INFORMED TODAY BY THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT BECAUSE OF LEGAL TECHNICALITIES RELATED TO
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY OF 1900, IT CANNOT KEEP
SERGIO BUSCHMANN IN PREVENTIVE CUSTODY, NOR CAN IT COMPLY WITH THE
EXTRADITION REQUEST THAT IS BEING PREPARED IN CHILE.  THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT
MAKES PUBLIC ITS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THIS DECISION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE AND THE U.S.  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THAT SOME COUNTRIES SHOULD LIMIT
THEMSELVES TO EXPELLING THE TERRORIST BUSCHMANN FROM THEIR TERRITORY.  WE
HAVE REQUESTED THAT JUSTICE BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE SO THAT BUSCHMANN CAN BE
SUBMITTED TO DUE PROCESS IN A CASE OF A STRICTLY JUDICIAL NATURE.

   BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS A TERRORIST; HE HAS
ENDORSED VIOLENCE, INCITED ASSASSINATION, AND RAISED FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE
OF ARMS TO KILL CHILEANS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AT THE PROPER TIME
THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE ARMS CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED IN CHILE FOR
TERRORIST PURPOSES BY SERGIO BUSCHMANN.  THIS ACT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY
CONDEMNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, BECAUSE IT REVEALED THE THREAT
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM POSES TO THE SECURITY OF THE HEMISPHERE.  THE
CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AND WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS AT EVERY
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BUSCHMANN TO COURT, AND IT MUST NOW DEPLORE AND REJECT
THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH THIS AVOWED CRIMINAL WILL CONTINUE TO ENDORSE
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. [END RECORDING]

   TERRORIST SERGIO BUSCHMANN, SPOKESMAN FOR THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC
FRONT, HAS THE STATUS OF POLITICAL REFUGEE IN SWEDEN.  WHEN CARLOS DUCCI WAS
ASKED IF BUSCHMANN HAS TRAVELED TO SWEDEN, HE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW
AND THAT HE ONLY HAS INFORMATION THAT BUSCHMANN HAS BEEN SET FREE.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 17 JUN 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUA
HAS DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENCY
MINISTER ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH 8 DAYS AGO, AN ALLEGATION MADE BY THE
SALVADORAN ARMY.  AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COMMANDER BAYARDO ARCE, VICE
COORDINATOR OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION OF THE RULING SANDINIST
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FSLN, TERMED IRRESPONSIBLE THE CHARGES MADE
IN SAN SALVADOR THAT NICARAGUA TRAINED THE COMMANDO WHO KILLED
RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   ARCE SAID:  WE LACK THE EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH ATTACKS AND THEREFORE COULD
NOT HAVE TRAINED ANYONE.  HE RECALLED THAT THE FSLN NEVER RESORTED TO THAT
TYPE OF ACTION DURING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATOR ANASTASIO SOMOZA,
WHO WAS OVERTHROWN IN 1979.

   THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE CLAIMED THAT RODRIGUEZ PORTH WAS KILLED
BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDO TRAINED IN
NICARAGUA.  HOWEVER, THAT GUERRILLA GROUP HAS DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE ACTION.

   ARCE ALSO DENIED THAT NICARAGUA HAS SENT WEAPONS TO PANAMA WHEN TENSION
WITH THE UNITED STATES INCREASED LAST MONTH, AS REPORTED IN THE U.S. MEDIA.
I AM NOT SURPRISED BY THOSE STATEMENTS, ARCE SAID, ADDING THAT THE UNITED
STATES CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH
SUCH LIES.

ACCORDING TO A LAST - MINUTE OFFICIAL REPORT, SIX GUERRILLAS OF THE
SO-CALLED CAMILIST UNION OF THE SO-CALLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
ELN DIED TODAY DURING FIGHTING WITH (LA POPA) BATTALION TROOPS IN THE
SLOPES OF THE PERIJA MOUNTAIN RANGE.  A MILITARY COMMAND SPOKESMAN
SAID THAT THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE A SCANT 10 KM FROM THE VILLAGE OF
SAN JACINTO IN SAN DIEGO MUNICIPALITY, WHERE FOUR SOLDIERS DIED LAST
WEEK IN AN AMBUSH.

   POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE AROUND THE CANO
LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE AFTER TWO NEW ATTACKS, ALSO BY THE ELN, OCCURRED IN
HUILA AND NORTH SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS.

   THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN HUILA DEPARTMENT TOOK PLACE IN LA MOTOSA, NEAR
AIPE MUNICIPALITY, WHERE THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL BETWEEN NEIVA AND
LA DORADA WAS DYNAMITED.  HUMBERTO BRINES TRAVELED EARLY TODAY TO THE SCENE
OF THE EVENTS AND REPORTED THE FOLLOWING:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BRINES] A NEW ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT AGAINST
THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL FROM NEIVA TO DORADA.  SUSPECTED ELN
GUERRILLAS PLACED A DYNAMITE CHARGE AT THE PLACE CALLED LA MOTOSA, NEAR AIPE
MUNICIPALITY, WHICH COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE GUARD POST AND A STRETCH OF THE
PIPELINE.  A FIRE IMMEDIATELY BROKE OUT AND THE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETELY
GUTTED.

   CRUDE OIL PUMPING WAS SUSPENDED AND EFFORTS TO CONTAIN THE FIRE AND TO
REPAIR THE PIPELINE BEGAN AT 2300.  THE EXTENT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT YET
BEEN ASSESSED.  THIS PIPELINE PUMPS 58,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY.  THE MAIN
PUMPING STATION IS LOCATED IN AIPE MUNICIPALITY.  WORKERS FROM (JOCOL) AND
ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE] WORKED INTENSELY ALL
THROUGH THE PREDAWN HOURS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE, ENABLING IT TO RESUME
PUMPING OPERATIONS AT 1000.

   EVEN THOUGH THE ELN HAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED THE OIL PIPELINES, WORK HAS
CONTINUED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MULTIPLE PIPELINE IN HUILA, WHICH
WILL PUMP 138,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY BETWEEN NEIVA AND COVENAS.  THE
SAME PIPELINE WAS BLOWN UP ONLY 1 MONTH AGO, A SCARCE 25 KM FROM THAT PLACE.

   BOGOTA, 20 JUN 89 (EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK) -- [TEXT] THE DAMAGE
CAUSED BY THE LATEST TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL
PIPELINE HAS SO FAR BEEN ESTIMATED AT ALMOST 75 BILLION PESOS.
ACCORDING TO ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE], THERE HAVE
BEEN FOUR DYNAMITE ATTACKS ON THE PIPELINE IN THE LAST 72 HOURS.
BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS, COLOMBIA WILL HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM MARKETING
CRUDE OIL ABROAD FOR 3 WEEKS, THUS LOSING $150 MILLION.  THE DAMAGE
CAUSED TO THE COVENAS PLANT AMOUNTS TO $7 MILLION; ANOTHER $7 MILLION
WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT ON REPAIRS.

   ECOPETROL PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO LONDONO SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE WILL FEEL THE IMPACT OF THESE ATTACKS.  ALREADY THE ROYALTIES GIVEN
TO THE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED, AND AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES
WILL BE NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNTRY'S
PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE AUTHORITIES.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS COUNTEROFFENSIVE AGAINST ELN [ARMY
OF NATIONAL LIBERATION] GUERRILLAS, WHICH HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE ATTACKS ON THE OIL PIPELINE, EXERTING PRESSURE TO MODIFY THE OIL
POLICY.  THE LATEST ATTACK ON THE PIPELINE OCCURRED AT THE LISAMA
INSTALLATIONS, LOCATED BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA.  ELN
GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THESE INSTALLLATIONS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
PRODUCING GAS AND PETROLEUM.  THE GUERRILLAS CUT 80 PERCENT OF THE CABLES
ATTACHED TO THE MOTORS WHICH EXTRACT FUEL.

   A DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS ALSO PLACED ON THE PIPELINE AT KM-28 IN CANO
LIMON-COVENAS, IN THE AREA OF CARMEN, NEAR THE TONCHALA RIVER, IN NORTHERN
SANTANDER.  NO FUEL, HOWEVER, WAS LOST.  THE ATTACKS HAVE NOW EXTENDED TO
HUILA DEPARTMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME, DAMAGING FUEL INSTALLATIONS.  HERE THE
OIL SPILL WAS STOPPED BY CLOSING DOWN THE INSTALLATIONS.

   FURTHERMORE, NINE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED, EIGHT MORE HAVE BEEN
CAPTURED, AND AN ELN TRAINING CENTER HAS BEEN DISMANTLED.  THIS IS THE
RESULT OF THE ARMY'S FIRST COUNTERINSURGENCY ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE
DETERMINED TO DO AWAY WITH THE NATION'S RESOURCES BY ATTACKING THE CANO
LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE.  MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT NEAR
SERRANIA DE PERIJA, CESAR DEPARTMENT, THE 2D BRIGADE'S (LA POPA) BATTALION
TROOPS CLASHED WITH ELN GUERRILLAS.  THE CLASH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF SIX
GUERRILLAS AND THE CONFISCATION OF A GREAT AMOUNT OF WAR MATERIEL.

   IN ADDITION, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ARMY DISMANTLED AN ELN URBAN
NETWORK, CAPTURING EIGHT OF ITS MEMBERS.  MEANWHILE, THE 14TH BRIGADE'S
(LUCIANO DE LURIA) BATTALION TROOPS KILLED JOSE ANTONIO VELASCO, A FARC
[REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] LEADER.  FINALLY, 5TH BRIGADE
TROOPS ARE CONTINUING THEIR ACTIONS IN THE CACATUMBO AREA, WHERE THE ELN
HAS TAKEN REFUGE.  THE ELN, COMMANDED BY SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, HAS
BASED ITS OPERATIONS IN EASTERN COLOMBIA.

   BOGOTA, 21 JUN 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST THAT THAT IT IS WILLING TO
ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE ON THE COUNTRY'S OIL POLICY.  THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT
A DESTRUCTIVE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO FORCE
THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THIS INDUSTRY.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE IS
CONVEYED IN A TAPE SENT TO CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA FROM FORMER
SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, WHO IS THE ELN'S FOUNDER AND LEADER.  ACCORDING
TO LEYVA, PEREZ EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH HIM TO EXPLAIN THE
GUERRILLA GROUP'S IDEAS ON WHAT COLOMBIA'S OIL POLICY SHOULD BE.  LEYVA SAID
THAT THE ELN ALSO DEMANDED THAT NATIONALIZATION BE APPLIED TO OTHER NATURAL
RESOURCES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE ELN -- WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S
PEACE OFFER -- REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO "HUMANIZE" THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY, SO THAT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WILL NOT BE
AFFECTED.

   LEYVA HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN SEEKING A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN
GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE GOVERNMENT.  TO THIS END HE HAS MET SEVERAL TIMES
WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC) COMMANDERS, WHICH IS WHY THE ELN SELECTED HIM AS THE BEARER OF ITS
MESSAGE.

   THE ELN HAS CONCENTRATED ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
OIL PIPELINE, WHICH EXTENDS 800 KM FROM THE EASTERN TO THE NORTHWESTERN
REGIONS OF COLOMBIA.  IT HAS CAUSED MILLIONS IN LOSSES TO THE STATE
COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE [ECOPETROL] AND SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE
RESULTING FROM OIL SPILLS.

   IN 1988, IT ATTACKED THE NATION'S PIPELINES APPROXIMATELY 50 TIMES, AND
THUS FAR THIS YEAR THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT 21 ATTACKS.  ON 16 JUNE, THE MAIN
OIL RESERVES IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT CITY OF COVENAS WERE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED
BY SEVERAL DYNAMITE BLASTS SET OFF BY THE GUERRILLAS.

   THIS WAS THE ELN'S MOST DARING AND SERIOUS ATTACK TO DATE.  THE ELN
CLAIMS THAT THE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT CARRY OUT OIL EXPLORATION AND
DRILLING WITH ECOPETROL ARE "PLUNDERING" COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS WARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
PRESSURING THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA
TO INCREASE ITS "AGGRESSIVE" ACTIONS AGAINST THE SANDINISTS.

   DURING A MEETING WITH INDUSTRIALISTS IN MASAYA, 35 KM SOUTH OF MANAGUA,
ORTEGA SOUNDED IRRITATED IN LIGHT OF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT'S THREATS TO
BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

   ON SATURDAY, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE TO PROTEST
STATEMENTS BY NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D' ESCOTO AGAINST HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA, WHOM D' ESCOTO ACCUSED OF HAVING IMPLEMENTED A
"NARCOSTATE".

   ORTEGA SAID:  "WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HONDURAS FEELS OFFENDED WHEN WE
ARE THE ONES WHO WERE OFFENDED, NOT THEM."

   "WE COULD HAVE BROKEN RELATIONS WITH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME
AGO, FROM THE MOMENT HONDURAS WAS FIRST USED AS A SPRINGBOARD TO ATTACK
NICARAGUA," THE SANDINIST LEADER STRESSED.

   THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY YESTERDAY WARNED, IN A VEILED MANNER, THAT
NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS " D' ESCOTO'S DIRTY REMARKS."'

   HONDURAS "HAS REACTED WITH JUSTIFIED INDIGNATION, TO THE POINT OF
REQUESTING A BREAK IN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY ADDED.  

   D' ESCOTO, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN VENEZUELA, CRITICIZED HONDURAS' POLICY AND
SAID THAT HONDURAS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY TO HOLD THE NEXT CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   THE HEAD OF NICARAGUA SAID THAT THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES "HAVE OFFENDED
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WITH THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS, AND THEY HAVE SERVED AS
A SPRINGBOARD FOR THE MURDER OF CHILDREN AND THE MUTILATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   ORTEGA ALSO CRITICIZED U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE'S VISIT TO
TEGUCIGALPA AND SAID THAT THOSE MEETINGS IN WHICH NICARAGUA WAS ATTACKED
"MUST BE DENOUNCED."

   TEGUCIGALPA, 27 JUN 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] AN ALLEGED SANDINIST
OFFICER WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE CARRIED OUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO HONDURAN
MILITARY AUTHORITIES TODAY.  

   THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ,
SAID HE HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA IN 1980, AND SAID WAS IN HONDURAS ON AN
ESPIONAGE MISSION WITH TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SANDINIST ARMY, WHOM HE DID
NOT IDENTIFY.

   SOLORZANO CALLED TOGETHER A GROUP OF NEWSMEN IN THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO
SULA, IN NORTHERN HONDURAS, AND TURNED HIMSELF OVER TO THE MILITARY
AUTHORITIES IN THE REPORTERS' PRESENCE.

   THE OFFICER DECLINED TO GIVE DETAILS ABOUT "DELICATE MATTERS" ABOUT WHICH
HE WILL BRIEF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.  HE SAID THEY CONCERN HIS
ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE MAY.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID HE ARRIVED IN HONDURAS IN AUGUST 1988 WITH AN
IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM THE HONDURAN NATIONAL REGISTRY OF PERSONS
IDENTIFYING HIM AS A HONDURAN FROM COMAYAGUA, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE
COUNTRY.

   HE TOLD THE PRESS HE HAS BEEN A SANDINIST SINCE 1974 AND HAD BEEN AN
URBAN GUERRILLA LEADER DURING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SOMOZIST REGIME IN
NICARAGUA.

   HE SAID THE DE FACTO GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTINUED RETENTION OF POWER BY
THE SANDINISTS FORCED HIM TO DEFECT.  HE ADDED THAT GROUPS OF SANDINISTS
HAVE BEEN INFILTRATED INTO TEGUCIGALPA, SAN PEDRO SULA, AND OTHER PARTS OF
HONDURAS TO CAUSE SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION.  

   HE EXPLAINED THAT AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES, THEIR MISSION WAS TO KILL
LEADERS OF MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN ATTRIBUTE THE DEATHS TO THE HONDURAN
ARMED FORCES, THEREBY FOMENTING SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE COUNTRY.

   HE ADDED THAT HIS CONTACTS WERE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE RECEIVED
$2,500 A MONTH TO CARRY OUT HIS ACTIVITIES IN HONDURAS.  

   THE DEFECTOR SAID SANDINIST OFFICERS DIRECT THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR
AND THAT THE ASSASSINATION IN FEBRUARY OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ,
FORMER COMMANDER OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, WAS PLOTTED IN MANAGUA.

   THE DEFECTOR SAID ALVAREZ HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SANDINISTS' SIGHTS
BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAIN PROMOTER OF THE CONTRAS (NICARAGUAN ARMED
OPPOSITION).

   SOLORZANO SAID NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO HAS MANY
"DELICATE THINGS" TO SAY AGAINST HONDURAS AND COSTA RICA.  [AS RECEIVED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 27 JUN 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO TODAY REVEALED THERE HAVE BEEN TWO ATTEMPTS TO MURDER HIM
SINCE HE ASSUMED THE PRESIDENTCY ON 14 JANUARY 1986.  

   CEREZO, WHO AVOIDED GIVING DETAILS ABOUT THE TWO ATTEMPTS, STATED THAT
"THERE IS SPECIFIC INFORMATION" ABOUT AN ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER HIM.  HE
ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO ONE CAN BE ARRESTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE.

   CEREZO ASSERTED THAT HE WITHDREW LAST WEEK TO SANTO TOMAS FARM,
APPROXIMATELY 43 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, TO THINK, STUDY GUATEMALA'S
PROBLEMS, AND REST.  

   CEREZO SAID HE ALSO RETREATED TO HIS FARM TO GIVE HIS SECURITY OFFICIALS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESCHEDULE ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE METHODS TO INCREASE THEIR
PROTECTION WITHOUT AFFECTING THE POPULATION OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE.

   ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUMMONING OF FOUR CIVILIANS WHO WERE LINKED
WITH ONE OF THE PLANS TO MURDER HIM, CEREZO SAID THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE
POLICE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLEGED PLAN.

   THE SECOND PLAN WAS REVEALED EARLY THIS MONTH BY HUGO ARCE, A COLUMNIST
OF THE GUATEMALAN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER EL GRAFICO, WHO 
 THE MURDER WAS GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT BY A LIBYAN COMMANDO UNIT THAT HAD
ENTERED GUATEMALA IN DECEMBER 1988 AND HAD BEEN TRAINED IN CUBA.

   CEREZO SAID THAT ARCE MUST TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE
"HE WOULD BE CONCEALING THE PLAN, WHICH IS A CRIME TO DO."

   OTHER CIVILIANS WHO WILL ALSO BE SUMMONED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE ARE MARIO DAVID GARCIA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, BOTH SUSPECTED OF
INVOLVEMENT IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP OF MAY 1988, AND JUAN MAEGLI.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID HE TRUSTS HIS SECURITY FORCES AND THAT IT IS VERY
EASY TO DISPLAY A LARGE-SCALE PROTECTION SYSTEM, BUT "THAT IS NEITHER MY
STYLE NOR THAT OF MY ASSISTANTS," CEREZO STRESSED.

   CEREZO ADDED THAT THE STATE HAS SECURITY MECHANISMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER
STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY BUT THOSE MECHANISMS CANNOT
ALWAYS BE USED AS EVIDENCE TO ARREST A PERSON.

   CEREZO DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRST ALLEGED PLAN TO MURDER
HIM.

   LA PAZ, 29 JUN 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION (COB)
REPRESENTATIVES REPORTED TODAY THAT THREE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH
THE KILLING OF TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES.  THE KILLINGS OCCURRED IN LA
PAZ ON 24 MAY.  

   THE KILLING OF THE TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES WAS CLAIMED BY A SELF- STYLED
"ZARATE WILLCA ARMED FORCES LIBERATION" GROUP. THIS IS THE SAME GROUP THAT
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GEORGE SHULTZ WHEN HE VISITED LA
PAZ IN AUGUST 1988 IN HIS CAPACITY AS U.S.  SECRETARY OF STATE.

   IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED DOZENS OF
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.  THEIR RELATIVES AND COB OFFICIALS HAVE CRITICIZED
THESE ARRESTS, WHICH THEY CLAIM "ARE AN ILLEGAL AND ARBITRARY ACTION."

   THE COB LEADERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS
CONSTANTINO YUJRA, A SOCIOLOGY STUDENT; TELMA SALAZAR, A NURSING STUDENT;
AND ALBERTO MENDOZA, A STUDENT AT THE WARISATA RURAL SCHOOL.

   MOREOVER, THE SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOOL OF THE SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY HAS
DECLARED ITSELF IN A "STATE OF EMERGENCY" UNTIL THE STUDENTS ARE RELEASED.
THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO CALLED A PROTEST MEETING FOR 30 JUNE.

   MORMON MISSIONARIES JEFFREY BRENT BALL AND RAY TODD WILSON WERE THE
MISSIONARIES KILLED.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A $500,000-REWARD TO
ANYONE WHO HELPS WITH THE CAPTURE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR KILLINGS.

COMA.  HE IS BEING TREATED AT A CHIMORE HOSPITAL.  UMOPAR [MOBILE
UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS] AGENTS FIRED MACHINEGUNS AT THE AREA FROM
HELICOPTERS TO SCARE THE LOCAL POPULATION AFTER COCA PRODUCERS BLOCKED
THE ROAD TO STOP AN UMOPAR VEHICLE TO FIRE.

   HUGO ZALAZAR FROM THE SINGLE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION OF BOLIVIAN
PEASANT WORKERS SAID THAT UMOPAR AGENTS PROTECT DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE
CONFEDERATION WILL CONVENE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEETING TO PROTECT COCA
GROWERS FROM VIOLENT UMOPAR RAIDS.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION [COB] CONDEMEND THE RAIDS AND DENIED
THAT PEASANTS HAD AMBUSHED THE UMOPAR PATROL.  COB LEADER ALEJANDRO GUZMAN
REPORTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GUZMAN] I MUST SAY THAT THE REPORT OF AN ALLEGED
AMBUSH IS COMPLETELY FALSE.  PEASANTS HAVE NOT CAPTURED UMOPAR OR DEA
HOSTAGES.  THERE WAS, HOWEVER, A VIOLENT ATTACK AGAINST COMPANERO DIEGO
MORALES ON HIS LAND, IN FRONT OF OTHER COCA GROWERS.  [END RECORDING]
[PASSAGE OMITTED]

   UMOPAR FORCES HAVE ALSO ARRESTED 30 PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN FRANCISCO,
CHAPARE, AFTER A POLICE PATROL WAS FORCED TO RELEASE 2 DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND
HAD TO FLEE FROM A CROWD OF NEARLY 1,000 PEASANTS.

   SOCIAL DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ SAID THE INCIDENT OCCURRED
AFTER A MINE-MAN UMOPAR PATROL CAPTURED TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE PEASANTS
INTERCEPTED THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE BEING TAKEN TO
CHIMORE.  THE POLICE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AFTER THE
PEASANTS THREATENED TO SHOOT THEM.  

   THE CROWD CONTINUED TO THREATEN THE PATROL, FORCING THE UMOPAR AGENTS TO
FLEE INTO THE WOODS.  THE PEASANTS -- SOME 400 STRONG -- BURNED THE UMOPAR
PICKUP AND CHASED THE POLICE INTO THE WOODS.

   UNDER SECRETARY GENARO MARQUEZ EXPLAINTS:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MARQUEZ] YESTERDAY, UMOPAR RAIDED SOME AREAS DURING
THE MORNING AND CLASHED WITH A LARGE GROUP OF PEASANTS IN PUERTO SAN
FRANCISCO, WHO ATTACKED THE PATROL AFTER LEARNING WHAT HAPPENED TO DIEGO
MORALES.  THE AGENTS HAD TO RELEASE TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS THEY WERE
BRINGING WITH THEM.  THEY WERE ABLE TO FLEE THE AREA AFTER SOME
DIFFICULTIES BUT WILL CONTINUE INVESTIGATING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END
RECORDING]

   MARQUEZ SAID THE 30 ARRESTED PEASANTS WILL BE QUESTIONED TO DETERMINE
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE INCIDENT AND THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT WILL BE
RELEASED.  MARQUEZ ALSO SAID POLICE SEIZED ARMS AND STICKS OF DYNAMITE.

AS THE RESULT OF A WAR THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED AMONG RIGHTIST GROUPS WITH

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE BLACKMAILED BY
THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THESE
ACTIONS ONLY SERVE TO CONFIRM THE WEAKNESS OF THE FMLN, WHICH SEEKS POWER
THROUGH VIOLENCE.

NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLAMOR OF A PEOPLE WHO WISH TO TALK RATHER THAN USE
VIOLENCE, A PEOPLE WHO WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   BOGOTA, 2 JUL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] FOUR COLOMBIAN LEFTIST GUERRILLA GROUPS
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PROMOTE A DIRECT PEACE DIALOGUE
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THIS WILL BRING TO FIVE
THE NUMBER OF REBEL GROUPS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY ACCEPTED THE PEACE
PROPOSAL THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT MADE IN SEPTEMBER 1988.

   THE LEFTIST M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT], WHICH APPEARED IN THE
MID-1970'S, KIDNAPPED 20 AMBASSADORS IN AN ATTACK ON THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY
IN BOGOTA, AND OCCUPIED THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985 -- AN ACTION
THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 100 PEOPLE -- HAS BEEN HOLDING PEACE TALKS
WITH THE BARCO GOVERNMENT SINCE DECEMBER.

   BOGOTA'S RADIO CADENA NACIONAL REPORTED THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED
FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC, COMMUNIST), THE MARXIST-LENINIST POPULAR
LIBERATION ARMY (EPL), THE INDIAN QUINTIN LAME COMMANDO UNIT, AND THE
REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY (PRT) ATTENDED A GUERRILLA SUMMIT HELD IN THE
PARAMO DE SUMAPAZ MOUNTAINS, IN SOUTHWEST BOGOTA, THIS WEEKEND.

   DURING THE GUERRILLA SUMMIT, THE FOURTH SINCE THE CREATION OF THE SIMON
BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSM), A DOCUMENT WAS DRAFTED
PROPOSING DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT BROADCAST BY RADIO CADENA NATIONAL, A DIALOGUE,
SIMILAR TO THE ONE BEING HELD WITH M-19, "WOULD SERVE TO ESTABLISH THE
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR PEACE AND NATIONAL HARMONY."

   CONTRARY TO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED, THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT SENT TO
PRESIDENT BARCO, BUT TO MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, FORMER OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT WHO RULED FROM 1970 - 1974.  PASTRANA IS A
MEMBER OF A COMMISSION OF NOTABLES CREATED TO MEDIATE FOR PEACE.  THIS
COMMISSION SHOULD ANALYZE THE PROPOSAL AND PRESENT IT TO THE GOVERNMENT IN A
FEW DAYS.

   APPARENTLY ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE SIMON BOLIVAR SUMMIT WERE DELEGATES
OF M-19 AND THE ELN, A GROUP THAT HAS UNLEASHED A VIOLENT CAMPAIGN TO
DESTROY THE OIL INDUSTRY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY THE LEADING CANO
LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE THAT CROSSES THE COUNTRY EAST TO WEST AND COVERS
NEARLY 800 KMS.

   THE DOCUMENT STRESSES THE NEED TO REACH A PEACEFUL POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH THE COUNTRY HAS HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR THE PAST 40
YEARS.

   THE SIGNATORIES OF THE DOCUMENT ASSERTED THAT "DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE
GOVERNMENT IS ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT COULD LEAD TO A SOLUTION."  THE
GOVERNMENT MUST CARRY OUT ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY
(SELF-DEFENSE) GROUPS WITH EVEN MORE DETERMINATION, THE DOCUMENT SAID.

   THEY ALSO DEMAND AN END TO THE "DIRTY WAR."

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT MISAEL PATRANA BORRERO
HAS SUMMONED THE NOTABLES COMMISSION, COMPRISED OF FABIO ECHEVERRI CORREA,
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIALISTS (ANDI) AND CARDINAL
MARIO REVOLLO CORREA, TO A MEETING ON MONDAY TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENT AND
PRESENT IT TO PRESIDENT BARCO.

   THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE FARC, THE EPL, THE QUINTIN LAME, AND THE
PRT -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THE UNILATERAL TRUCE SINCE
EARLY THIS YEAR -- LEAVES THE ELN AS THE ONLY ACTIVE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA
GROUP.  

   HOWEVER, THAT SUBVERSIVE GROUP, LED BY SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ,
ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING CHANNELS FOR PEACE IF A DATE
IS SET FOR A MEETING, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT
OIL POLICIES.

   THE ELN HAS OFFERED TO STOP ITS ATTACKS IF THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE
COUNTRY IS NATIONALIZED.

   BOGOTA, 4 JUL 89 (RUDE PRAVO) -- [ARTICLE] [MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER
OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE POLITBURO] [TEXT]
RECENTLY NEW PHENOMENA HAVE MADE THEIR WAY ONTO THE COLOMBIAN
POLITICAL SCENE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS
HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADOPT MEASURES AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING
PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENCES ARE BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN
THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   THESE ARGUMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO
THE ELECTIONS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA IN 1990.  AFTER
THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [CCP] HAD DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECURE
GUARANTEES THAT IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEM, IT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BECOME
INVOLVED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND NOW IT IS STRIVING TO CREATE A BROAD
DEMOCRATIC COALITION.

   THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS AS WELL AS THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL
CONDEMNATION OF THE "DIRTY WAR" IN COLOMBIA FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE
MORE DECISIVE STEPS IN A NUMBER OF SPHERES.  THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ARE:

   -- ISSUING PRESIDENTIALLY PROCLAIMED DECREES AGAINST HIRED ASSASSINS AND
CREATING AN ELITE MILITARY FORCE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM; ORGANIZING A
STRUGGLE AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND INCREASING PRISON
SENTENCES UP TO 20-30 YEARS FOR SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF
THEM;

   -- CONDUCTING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEFTIST COALITION PATRIOTIC UNION
(WHICH THE CCP IS A MEMBER OF) AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WITH
THE PARTICIPATION OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE;

   -- CONDUCTING A PURGE IN THE ARMY DIRECTED AGAINST THE OFFICERS WHO ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH GROUPS OF HIRED ASSASSINS.

   THE REASON FOR ACCELERATING THESE MEASURES WAS THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE SECRET POLICE (DAS), GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ,
CARRIED OUT ON 30 MAY BY PARAMILITARY GROUPS WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  A VEHICLE FILLED WITH 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS USED TO TRY TO
ASSASSINATE THE HEAD OF STATE SECURITY.  THE GENERAL ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY
BUT DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 7 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 50
WERE WOUNDED.  BECAUSE OF THIS ACT DIFFERENCES IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IN
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER INTENSIFIED.

   MAZA MARQUEZ HAS BEEN THE SWORN ENEMY OF THE MAFIA AND THE OBJECT OF
THEIR THREATS SINCE HE REVEALED THAT THE GANGS WHICH CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPTS AGAINST THE CCP AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE TRAINED MERCENARIES
FROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE FRG, AND GREAT BRITAIN.  AFTER ESCAPING
FROM AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 3 MAY, GENERAL MAZA MARQUEZ SENT A LETTER
TO THE STATE PROSECUTOR.  IN IT HE SAID THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY KNEW
ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED AGAINST HIM.  

   DURING THE SAME PERIOD CAPTAIN WANUMEN [NAME AS PUBLISHED] WAS
IMPRISONED; HE HAD SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, THE DAS, AND THE
AMERICAN CIA WHICH LIST HIGHLY PLACED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO WORK
AS "SPIES" FOR THE BENEFIT OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM THE MEDELLIN AND CALI
CARTELS.  ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO VARGAS DENIED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE
DOCUMENTS, REPORTS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED THAT THE RULING ELITE HAS BEEN
INFILTRATED WITH MAFIA AGENTS.

   IN THIS SITUATION SPACE OPENS UP FOR THE CCP'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE
PEACE TO THE COUNTRY BY WAY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL
PARTISAN GROUPS, NOT JUST WITH THE M-19 MOVEMENT, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS
PRACTICED TO DATE.  ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA IS STILL SERIOUS,
THERE ARE DEFINITE SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND FOR THE BETTER.

CALLAO, A BOMB HAD BEEN PLANTED AND DETONATED LAST WEDNESDAY UNDER A
BUS CARRYING CREW MEMBERS OF THE TRAWLER SHIPS "KURASOV" AND
"LAZURNY", YURIY GREMITSKIKH, FIRST DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, TOLD REPORTERS AT A BRIEFING HERE
TODAY.  AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ACTION 16 SOVIET SAILORS WERE
INJURED.  NONE WAS KILLED.  ALL THE INJURED SAILORS ARE GETTING
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

   THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR STATED THAT THE SOVIET SIDE EXPECTED THAT THE
INCIDENT WOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND THE CRIMINALS PUNISHED.  HE
ALSO DEMANDED THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
SOVIET CITIZENS AND OFFICES IN THAT COUNTRY.  THE PERUVIAN SIDE EXPRESSED A
FEELING OF REGRET CONCERNING THE INCIDENT AND ASSURED THAT ALL NECESSARY
STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO LOCATE GUILTY PERSONS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
SOVIET PEOPLE.

   THE SOVIET TRAWLER SHIPS WERE IN CALLAO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE USSR AND PERU ON COOPERATION IN
FISHING.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 5 JUL 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FOREIGN MINISTRY] [TEXT] THE HONDURAN FOREIGN RELATIONS MINISTRY,
BASED ON REPORTS FROM AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF SECURITY MATTERS
RELATED TO THE INTERROGATION OF CAPTAIN ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ -- AN
INTELLIGENCE AGENT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT -- INFORMS THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OF THE FOLLOWING:

   IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT WITH THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMS RACE BY THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT AND THE USE OF NICARAGUAN TERRITORY AS A POLITICAL AND
MILITARY BASE FOR SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES, ASSASSINATIONS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND
OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DESTABILIZATION IN THE REGION.

   OVER THE PAST 9 YEARS, EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF
INTERNATIONAL SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM.  HONDURAS, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO BEEN
AFFECTED BY THESE ACTIONS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.

   WE RECALL THE DEPLORABLE KIDNAPPING OF 100 PERSONS AT THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES IN CORTES IN 1982; THE ILLEGAL HIJACKING OF
TAN-SAHSA AIRCRAFT BY TERRORIST COMMANDOS WHO ALWAYS ENDED UP SEEKING REFUGE
IN MANAGUA OR HAVANA; THE PLANTING OF TWO BOMBS THAT DESTROYED POWER PLANTS
IN TEGUCIGALPA, AS WELL AS OTHER TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST HONDURAS BOTH INSIDE
AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY; CLANDESTINE ARMS TRAFFICKING, ETC.

   ON 27-28 JUNE, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED BY A
STATEMENT MADE IN SAN PEDRO SULA BY A NICARAGUAN CITIZEN WHO, ACCORDING TO
HIS STATEMENTS, IS AN ARMY CAPTAIN AND INTELLIGENCE AGENT FOR THE SANDINIST
REGIME.  HE DISCLOSED THAT, IN AUGUST 1988, HE WAS ASSIGNED THE MISSIONS OF
PLANNING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE
BEHEADING OF THE HONDURAN SPIRITUAL AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE
PHYSICAL ELIMINATION OF HONDURAN ARCHBISHOP MSGR HECTOR ENRIQUE SANTOS AND
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CARLOS ROBERTO FLORES AND RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS
ROMERO, OF THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES RESPECTIVELY.

   THE SANDINIST FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDED TO THESE REPORTS BY ISSUING A 29
JULY 1989 COMMUNIQUE, IN WHICH IT OPENLY ADMITTED THAT NICARAGUAN CITIZEN
ORLANDO ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ WAS AN ARMY LIEUTENANT -- NOT A CAPTAIN --
AND THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR THE NICARAGUAN INTERIOR MINISTRY FOR 7 AND 1/2
YEARS, FROM 20 AUGUST 1979 TO 28 JANUARY 1987.

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT ON 28 JANUARY 1987, SOLORZANO HAD BEEN FIRED
AND THAT HIS RECORD SHOWED A LONG LIST OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THIS
EXPLANATION VERY CONVENIENTLY ALLOWS NICARAGUA TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM
THE ESPIONAGE AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENT IN THE
EVENT HE WAS CAUGHT OR DESERTED.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT,
BECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGY AND BECAUSE IT HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE FINANCING AND
TRAINING -- BOTH POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY -- OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
TERRRORIST GROUPS, HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN THESE
GROUPS' CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS ON PEACEFUL
COEXISTENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  THIS SITUATION HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE
DIFFERENT PEACE EFFORTS THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE REGION TO ATTEMPT TO
PUT AN END TO THESE ACTIONS.  THE HONDURAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES HAVE KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST HONDURAS AND THE LINKS
BETWEEN NICARAGUAN EMBASSY PERSONNEL IN TEGUCIGALPA AND HONDURAN REBEL
GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN SPECIAL CAMPS IN NICARAGUA AND OTHER
TOTALITARIAN COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]

[CONTINUED] OUR MOST PROMISING FUTURE DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHAT WILL
HAPPEN, BUT ON WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD TOGETHER, ALL UNITED.
THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE ARGENTINES ARE FACING -- THE CHALLENGE OF
BEING ABLE TO TRANSFORM THIS CRISIS INTO A FERTILE SCENARIO.

   THIS IS THE TIME FOR REFLECTION AND IMAGINATION.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR
IDEAS, AS WELL AS FOR CREATIVITY AND BOLDNESS. THIS IS THE TIME TO ELIMINATE
WHAT IS DECREPIT AND WELCOME WHAT IS BEGINNING.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR
CREATIVE BOLDNESS, INNOVATION, AND COURAGE.

   THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN THE PATH OF DEMOCRACY WITH A SOCIAL
ACCENT.  THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, PEACE AND
DEVELOPMENT.

   THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE OPTED TO TRANSFORM OUR DECADENCE, TO OVERCOME
OUR PETTY DISAGREEMENTS, AND TO MOUNT A COLLECTIVE EFFORT.

   THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR THE EPIC OF NATIONAL UNITY.
THEREFORE, OURS IS A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY. IN OUR OPINION, NATIONAL
UNITY IS NOT STRENGTHENED BY HEGEMONIC PROJECTS, PATERNAL ATTITUDES,
PASSIONATE FITS, OR FLEETING EMOTIONS.

   GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT DEPEND
ON THE MANDATE OF A SINGLE MAN, THE WHIM OF A PARTY, OR THE IMPOSITION OF A
SECTOR.  APPLAUSE

   THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IS THE PROPERTY OF ALL ARGENTINES.  NO
ONE CAN FEEL UNINTERESTED.  NO ONE CAN FEEL UNINVITED.

   IF ARGENTINA IS NOT OCCUPYING ITS PROPER PLACE, IT IS NOT THE COUNTRY'S
BUT ALL ARGENTINES RESPONSIBILITY.  IT SHOULD BE BLAMED ON OUR DIVISIONS,
HISTORIC BURDENS, IDEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES, AND SECTARIANISMS.

   WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FORMULATE AN HONEST BALANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S
VICTORIES AND FAILURES, ITS WEAK AND STRONG POINTS, AND ITS MISTAKES AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

   THIS IS THE FIRST LESSON WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNED TOGETHER BECAUSE THE
TIME OF THE WORST UNDERDEVELOPMENT, THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF CONSIDERING
THOSE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY AN ENEMY, HAS ENDED IN THIS COUNTRY.  APPLAUSE

   THANK GOD, THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE PREVAILED HAS ENDED.
THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH AN OFFICIAL COUNTRY AND A SUBMERGED COUNTRY HAS
ENDED.  THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH A VISIBLE COUNTRY AND A REAL COUNTRY HAS ENDED.

   I HAVE COME TO UNITE THOSE TWO ARGENTINAS.  I HAVE COME TO STRUGGLE FOR
THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE TWO FATHERLANDS.

   I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF A FACTION, A GROUP, A SECTOR, OR A
POLITICAL EXPRESSION.  I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF YET ANOTHER

   BOGOTA, 9 JUL 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] THE
ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY ELN HAS PROMISED TO RELEASE NORWEGIAN
ANTHROPOLOGIST BRUCE OLSON WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE ELN HAD
KIDNAPPED AND SENTENCED OLSON TO DEATH. ELN MILITARY COMMANDER NICOLAS
RODRIGUEZ ANNOUNCED THIS DECISION TO REPORTERS FROM THE SPANISH NEWS
AGENCY EFE.

   OLSON, A PHILOSOPHER AND ANTHROPOLOGIST, ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA 30 YEARS AGO
AND WAS WORKING WITH THE MOTILONES INDIANS IN THE CATATUMBO JUNGLE AT THE
TIME OF HIS CAPTURE.  HE HAD BUILT 14 SCHOOLS AND SEVERAL HEALTH CENTERS IN
THE AREA.  HE HAD ALSO WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE MOTILO INDIAN LANGUAGE.
THE ELN, HOWEVER, ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A CIA AGENT AND AN EXPLOITER OF THE
INDIAN PEOPLE.  THE ELN KIDNAPPED OLSON, DECLARED HIM A PRISONER OF WAR, AND
SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH.  HOWEVER, THIS NIGHTMARE IS NOW OVER.  THE ELN HAS
PROMISED TO TURN OLSON OVER SAFE AND SOUND TO THE RED CROSS IN THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.

   IN ADDITION, THE ELN SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT BARCO.  PARLIAMENTARIANS
GUILLERMO ALBERTO GONZALEZ AND ORLANDO GOMEZ WILL DELIVER THE LETTER TO THE
PRESIDENT TOMORROW.  IN THIS LETTER, THE ELN LISTS ITS DEMANDS, WHICH, IF
MET, WOULD LEAD THEM TO HALT THE BLOWING UP OF OIL PIPELINES.  

   ACCORDING TO GONZALEZ, THE GUERRILLA GROUP DEMANDS THE DISMISSAL OF MINES
MINISTER OSCAR MEJIA AND ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE]
PRESIDENT ANDRES RESTREPO.  THE ELN ALSO CONDITIONED THEIR SUSPENSION OF
ATTACKS AGAINST THE PIPELINES ON THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL PETROLEUM
COUNCIL AND A FORUM FOR A DEBATE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT OIL POLICY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] MY IMPRESSION DURING MY 2 DAYS OF
CAPTIVITY IS THAT THEY ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO A DEBATE ON THE NATION'S
OIL POLICY.  THEY DEMAND THAT THIS DEBATE BE CARRIED OUT THROUGH A COUNCIL
MEETING, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT, LABOR
UNIONS -- PARTICULARLY THE (USO) AND ECOPETROL UNIONS -- AS WELL AS SEVERAL
PROMINENT FIGURES WHOM THEY LISTED IN THE LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT. [END

   GONZALEZ ADDED THAT HE AGREES WITH COMPTROLLER RODOLFO GONZALEZ THAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD TALK WITH THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP WHICH IN THE PAST HAS
BEEN THE MOST UNWILLING TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS.

COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE REBEL GROUP ANNOUNCES ITS CAMPAIGN WAR FOR LIFE,
COMES OUT AGAINST THE DIRTY WAR, AND MAKES A NEW CALL FOR A NATIONAL OIL
FORUM FOR VARIOUS POLITICAL AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF
THIS VITAL PRODUCT OF OUR ECONOMY.  THE ELN HOPES TO PRESENT THROUGH THIS
FORUM ITS VIEWS ON OIL POLICY.

   [MAYOR NEVARDO MORALES] THEY ASSURED US THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO US,
THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS ONLY PART OF A CAMPAIGN
THEY ARE WAGING CALLED THE WAR FOR LIFE. THEY KIDNAPPED ME AND TOOK ME TO

   [MORALES] THE COMMUNIQUE IS BEING HELD BY THE MAYOR OF SAN CARLOS.  IN
ANY EVENT, WE WANT TO SPEAK TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRETARY TOMORROW OR THIS

   MOSCOW (USSR), 9 JUL 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [REPORT] [A. CHEREPANOV,
MEXICO CITY CORRESPONDENT] [TEXT] AS IZVESTIYA HAS ALREADY REPORTED,
ON 5 JULY AT 1000 HOURS LOCAL [PERU] TIME, A BUS WITH SOVIET SEAMEN ON
BOARD WAS BLOWN UP BY A BOMB.  AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION 20 PEOPLE
WERE INJURED, OF WHOM 17 WERE HOSPITALIZED, 3 OF THEM IN A SERIOUS
CONDITION.

   OUR MEXICO CITY CORRESPONDENT A. CHEREPANOV CALLED EMBASSY AND MINISTRY
OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES IN LIMA.  HERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL
DETAILS HE MANAGED TO OBTAIN.  ON THE MORNING OF 5 JULY A GROUP OF 52 PEOPLE
IN TWO BUSES VISITED THE "ALBATROS" STORE, AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG OFF-DUTY
CREWS FROM SOVIET FISHING VESSELS WORKING IN PERUVIAN COASTAL WATERS.  THE
EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON ONE OF THE BUSES AS IT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE.

   FORTUNATELY, THE BOMB WAS HOMEMADE AND NOT THAT POWERFUL.  AND IT HAD
OBVIOUSLY BEEN HASTILY PLANTED (ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, FOUR SUSPICIOUS
CHARACTERS HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE BUS).  THE PASSENGERS WERE INJURED
MAINLY BY PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS.

   THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE ON THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY.  NEARLY
ALL THE CASUALTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY HOSPITALIZED.  IT IS TRUE THAT AT FIRST
THERE WAS A MIXUP IN THE HOSPITAL OVER RUSSIAN NAMES -- IT TOOK THE DOCTORS
A WHILE TO WORK OUT WHICH PHOTOGRAPH BELONGED TO WHOM.  REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE SOVIET EMBASSY AND CONSULATE CAME TO THEIR AID.  ON THE SAME DAY SKILLED
OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT ON ALL THOSE WHO REQUIRED THEM.  THE IZVESTIYA
CORRESPONDENT WAS OFFICIALLY INFORMED THAT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED SOVIET
SEAMEN WERE OUT OF DANGER.  THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN INFORMED.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESS BELIEVES THAT THE TERRORIST ACT CARRIED OUT AGAINST
SOVIET CITIZENS WAS THE WORK OF THE MAOIST-INCLINED LEFTIST ARMED GROUPING
"SENDERO LUMINOSO."  BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION:  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY ULTRARIGHTISTS OPPOSING THE FISHING AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN
PERU AND THE USSR.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 7 JUL 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [REPORT] [V. ZAYKIN] [TEXT]
THIRTYTHREE SOVIET SEAMEN HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF
CALLAO AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION CAUSED BY A BOMB PLANTED UNDER A
BUS STANDING IN THE STREET.

   OUR CORRESPONDENT TELEPHONED THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY AND
ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT.

   "IT HAPPENED ON 5 JULY AT 1010 HOURS LOCAL TIME," S. SVINARENKO, DEPUTY
CHIEF OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY FOREIGN RELATIONS
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT, SAID.  "SIXTEEN SEAMEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.  THE SEAMEN MAINLY SUFFERED
FRACTURES, CUTS, AND BURNS.  THE VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CREWS OF TWO
LARGE, AUTONOMOUS TRAWLERS -- THE 'VLADIMIR KURASOV' AND THE 'LAZURNYY' --
WHO WERE ON SHORE LEAVE THAT DAY.

   "OUR SEAMEN ARE WORKING IN THIS REGION ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT ON
COOPERATION BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOVIET UNION.  WE ASSIST THE PERUVIANS IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY, GET OUR SHIPS REPAIRED IN LOCAL
PORTS, AND FISH WITHIN A 200-MILE ZONE OF THAT COUNTRY...."

   REUTER AND AFP HAVE REPORTED THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE CALLAO POLICE,
THE EXPLOSION WAS ORGANIZED BY THE "SENDERO LUMINOSO," A REBEL GROUP OF
MAOIST PERSUASION.  "THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS ACT, WHICH
DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST TOTALLY INNOCENT CITIZENS,"
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID.

   THE SOVIET SEAMEN WERE ON A BUS WHICH HAD STOPPED AT A STORE WHEN THE
BOMB, PLANTED UNDER AN EMPTY BUS STANDING NEARBY, WAS DETONATED.

   ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEARING SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE
SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,
PLACING A PACKAGE UNDER THE BUS.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS AN EXTREME LEFT-WING REBEL ORGANIZATION WAGING A
GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.  IT
BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980.  SINCE THEN, PERU HAS KNOWN NO PEACE.
REPORTS OF MURDERS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE COMMITTED BY THIS ORGANIZATION ARE
APPEARING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE WORLD PRESS.  THE TERRORISTS'
VICTIMS ARE POLITICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE, SOLDIERS,
PEASANTS....  THE TERRORISTS OFTEN INVOLVE JUVENILES IN THEIR ACTS OF
SABOTAGE.

   THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY MORE AND MORE EXTENSIVELY
ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
BUT SO FAR THIS HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE RESULTS.

BERNARDO JARAMILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION (UP),
RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TODAY TO URGE THE CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS BEING PROMOTED BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT.  

   JARAMILLO, A 35-YEAR-OLD LEGISLATOR, REPLACED JAIME PARDO LEAL AS UP
PRESIDENT AFTER PARDO LEAL WAS ASSASSINATED IN OCTOBER 1987.  JARAMILLO HAD
LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER RECEIVING MANY DEATH THREATS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE
PEACE PROPOSALS FORMULATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
AND INSTEAD HAS INCREASED ITS ATTACKS ON THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM
INSTALLATIONS TO DEMAND THE NATIONALIZATION OF THAT INDUSTRY.

   JARAMILLO ASKED THE ELN TO STOP ITS VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH, HE SAID, DO
NOT IN ANY WAY BENEFIT COLOMBIA.  

   THE LEFTIST LEADER SAID HE IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED THAT "THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS
IMPROVED."

   THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, HAS BEGUN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT
CITIZENS.

   "MORE SECURITY MEASURES ARE NEEDED, BUT SOME MEASURES ARE BEING ADOPTED,"
JARAMILLO SAID.  HE STRESSED THAT IF ALL THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS DECIDE TO
HOLD A SINCERE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE FOR THE COUNTRY.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 13 JUL 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL ERIC SANCHEZ, COMMANDER OF 4TH INFANTRY BATTALION, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [SANCHEZ] GOOD MORNING, HRN [VOZ DE
HONDURAS] LISTENERS.  I AM A BIT CONCERNED OVER WHAT I HAVE HEARD ON
THIS RADIO STATION.  THE TRUTH IS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0030 TODAY,
THERE WAS AN ATTACK WITH A HOMEMADE BOMB IN LA CEIBA, AND, AS A
RESULT, SEVEN U.S.  SOLDIERS -- NOT SIX -- WERE WOUNDED.  FOUR
SUSTAINED VERY MINOR INJURIES, WHILE THREE WERE SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER OF DYING.  NINE SOLDIERS WERE IN
THAT GROUP.  THEY WERE NOT ON LEAVE; THEY WERE ON A MISSION FROM THE
ENRIQUE SOTO CANO HONDURAN AIR BASE AT PALMEROLA.

   THEY PROVOKED...  [CHANGES THOUGHT].  INSTEAD, I SHOULD SAY THAT
THEY WENT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT THE DILIDO DISCOTEQUE. OUR MILITARY POLICE
PATROLS WERE IN THE AREA AND SAW THE ATTACK.  WE CAPTURED TWO SUSPECTS.  OUR
MEN WERE ABOUT 100 METERS AWAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED, AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE TWO SUSPECTS ARE U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WERE IN THE
AREA AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL REPORT; THIS
IS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN LA CEIBA.  THE TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED, AND THEY
MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEVEN WHO WERE WOUNDED, WHO ARE AT THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] HOSPITAL.  WHAT YOU REPORTED OVER THE RADIO IS CORRECT.  THERE
IS NO NEED TO BE ALARMED.  IT WAS A HOMEMADE BOMB, AND THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED
BY THE SHRAPNEL, CEMENT, AND STONES THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR BY THE
EXPLOSION.  

   HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO DENY A REPORT BY THE MILKMAN FROM [WORD
INDISTINCT], WHO SAID THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND IS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THE PATROLS WERE ALREADY ON THE STREETS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT.  FUSEP
[THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCE] WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, AND
THEREFORE VEHICLES ENTERING OR LEAVING LA CEIBA WERE STOPPED AND SEARCHED.
THAT IS ALL; STANDSTILL MERELY BECAUSE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED, OR BECAUSE TWO OR THREE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED.

   THE CITY MUST FUNCTION NORMALLY.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE INTERESTED IN THE
CONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION.  SO THE MAN FROM [WORD INDISTINCT] WHO CALLED
AND SAID THAT HE WAS LOSING 100,000 LEMPIRAS [AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE
SEARCHES] THIS MORNING WAS TELLING A LIE.  WE GAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
THAT THE INSPECTION OF VEHICLES SHOULD BE CARRIED UNTIL 0500, AND THAT THE
VEHICLES SHOULD NOT BE DETAINED.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, IT WAS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDED
THE REPORT AND SAID THAT THE DELIVERY OF MILK HAD BEEN STOPPED.

   [SANCHEZ] WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR HIM -- WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY
-- I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE ARE STOPPING VEHICLES [AS HEARD].
WE STOPPED A VERY SMALL WHITE VAN WITH SOME LABORERS IN IT TO SEARCH THE
VAN.  I WAS THERE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WAS NO MILK ON THAT BUS; THERE
WERE PEOPLE ON THAT BUS, AND I MYSELF ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE.  I AM
SORRY THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED.  WE ARE NOT
PARALYZING ACTIVITIES, NOR ARE WE HOLDING THE CITY HOSTAGE.  AS I SAID, WE
ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.
WE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK; WE ARE
NOT SURE OF ANYTHING.  WE ARE MERELY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING
PREVENTIVE MEASURES.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, ARE THE TWO MEN YOU HAVE IN CUSTODY THE SAME U.S.
CITIZENS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT?

   [SANCHEZ] YES.  THE LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF THE PATROL [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THE PANTS, CLOTHES, AND THE COLOR OF WHAT THEY WERE WEARING INDICATED THAT
THEY WERE CIVILIANS.  LIEUTENANT SALGADO OF THE 4TH BATTALION WAS 50 METERS
AWAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  TWO PERSONS WERE CAPTURED.  HOWEVER, THEY
HAVE DENIED THAT EITHER OF THEM WAS INVOLVED.  THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  WE
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE ARMED FORCES INVESTIGATIVE
PERSONNEL TO ARRIVE TO LEARN THE IDENTITIES OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE BEING
HELD.  THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL.  WE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED.  WE ARE NOT PARALYZING
PRODUCTION; I WANT TO MADE THIS CLEAR.

   [REPORTER] YES, OF COURSE.  COLONEL, GIVEN THE SITUATION, DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT THE SITUATION IN THE ARMED FORCES IS COMPLETELY NORMAL?

   [SANCHEZ] OF COURSE IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.  WE ARE NOT RESTRICTING
ANYONE'S FREEDOM.  WHEN IT GETS DARK, WE WILL PROCEED TO ASK FOR
IDENTIFICATION PAPERS; WE WILL STOP AND CHECK VEHICLES, WHICH IS NORMAL IN
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION.  HOWEVER, AT NO TIME WILL WE PARALYZE PRODUCTION OR
NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES.  WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ATTACK.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S.  CITIZENS,
IT WAS CERTAINLY AN ATTACK AGAINST PEACE AND ORDER.  WE THEREFORE HAVE TO
INVESTIGATE IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT INVOLVED U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN
THIS CASE, AND IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, I PERSONALLY ISSUED ORDERS AND
FOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATION UNTIL 0500, WHEN I SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS.  I
PERSONALLY ORDERED THESE MEASURES.  I AM AMAZED THAT THE CATTLEMEN DO NOT
TRANSPORT MILK BEFORE 0500.

   [REPORTER] ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS MATTER:  IS THE SITUATION IN LA
CEIBA RELATED TO THE LATEST VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN SAN PEDRO SULA?

   [SANCHEZ] I BELIEVE SO.  A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED
AGAINST SOCIAL PEACE IN HONDURAS.  THIS STATION'S LISTENERS AND LISTENERS OF
ALL OTHER HONDURAN RADIO STATIONS KNOW THE HIGH - CALIBER OF THE ARMED
FORCES PERSONNEL, BEGINNING WITH THE TOP COMMANDERS AND CONTINUING WITH
OFFICERS DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.  WE ARE SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSES AND
ARE NOT MOTIVATED BY VESTED INTERESTS OF ANY KIND.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTS OF BLOODSHED, WHICH ARE [WORDS INDISTINCT], ARE PART OF A SERIES OF
FULLY PLANNED, COLDLY CALULATED ACTIONS.

   I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE A COMIC STRIP CHARACTER, BUT I BELIEVE THAT
THESE ACTIONS ARE CONNECTED AND OVERLAP.  I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED WHITE HANDS
AND BLACK HANDS [DEATH SQUADS], WHICH CONCERN US VERY MUCH.  WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT HONDURANS KILLING HONDURANS.  

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO THIS STATION.  WE
WILL BE CONTACTING YOU DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS HOMEMADE BOMB ATTACK IN LA CEIBA.

   [SANCHEZ] WE ARE COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE.  WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOU
INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.  WE ARE A COMPLETELY OPEN, NOT CLOSED,
ORGANIZATION.  WE WILL GIVE YOU TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR THE
BENEFIT OF ALL HONDURANS.

   LA PAZ, 3 JUL 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [TEXT] DAVID ANEZ, LEADER OF THE
BLOC OF CONGRESSMEN FROM BENI DEPARTMENT, SAID YESTERDAY THAT "THE
BENI PEOPLE ARE PERIODICALLY SUFFERING RETALIATORY ATTACKS BY UMOPAR
[MOBILE UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS] AND DEA AGENTS, WHO ARE ACTIVELY
ENGAGED IN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POLULATION, NOT
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS."  ANEZ MADE THESE REMARKS WHILE COMMENTING
ON LAST WEEK'S INCIDENTS IN SANTA ANA DE YACUMA.

   ANEZ CHARGED THAT THE ATTACKS ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST "OPEN, PEACEFUL
CIVILIANS; THAT IS, AGAINST CITIZENS WHO ARE IN NO WAY INVOLVED IN THE DRUG
TRADE.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE MURDERED OR HARASSED IN WAYS NOT IN KEEPING
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY."

   ANEZ SAID THE PEOPLE OF SANTA ANA ARE RESTLESS AND THAT ALL BENI
DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALERT TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RECENT INCIDENTS.

   ANEZ ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LEADER OF THE BENI CONGRESSIONAL BLOC, HE SENT A
LETTER TO PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO IN WHICH HE OUTLINES THE ISSUE THE
GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS TO PREVENT FURTHER CLASHES BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND
SECURITY FORCES.

   ANEZ SAID THE GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE IN BENI
DEPARTMENT FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL
STANDPOINTS BECAUSE THE DRUG TRADE GOES BEYOND BENI BORDERS; IT IS AN
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY THAT HAS BUILT AN ECONOMIC EMPIRE FAR MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE BENI PEOPLE, ALL BOLIVIANS, AND THAN THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 JUL 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [EXCERPTS] THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BANNED ENTRANCE INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF EL
SALVADOR CAMPUS AND ARE THREATENING TO FIRE ON ANYONE WHO DISOBEYS
THIS ORDER.  THIS AFTERNOON, THE ARMY ALLOWED NEITHER VEHICLES NOR
STUDENTS TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  ACCORDING TO MILITARY
OFFICIALS, ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SHOOT ANYONE WHO DISOBEYED BY
ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  THE MEASURE WENT INTO
EFFECT AT 1730.  THE SITUATION GREW TENSE WHEN PRIVATE CARS ATTEMPTED
TO ENTER THE CAMPUS GROUNDS.

   UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS MET WITH THE MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMED
FORCES HIGH COMMAND, SINCE 23 DECEMBER 1988, THE MILITARY HAS NOT ALLOWED
WEAPONS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO OR TAKEN OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  THE
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER TO ALLOW THE ENTRANCE OF STUDENTS AND VEHICLES BECAME
HEATED.  UNIVERSITY GENERAL MANAGER MARIO ALFREDO CABRERA SAID THAT THIS
MEASURE IS INTENDED TO SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSITY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CABRERA] ALL OF THIS FALLS UNDER THE GENERAL CAMPAIGN
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AGGRESSION AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY TO MINIMIZE ITS AUTHORITY
IN LIGHT OF ITS ROLE AS THE GOVERNMENT'S AND THE NATION'S CONSCIENCE, WHICH
OFFICIALS -- WHO ARE NOT LEADING THE COUNTRY ALONG THE CORRECT PATH -- DO
NOT LIKE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BASIC REASON BEHIND THIS AND OTHER
MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE HELICOPTERS OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS AT VERY
LOW ALTITUDES AND SOLDIERS THREATENING TO SHOOT TO KILL IF THE ORDER IS
DISOBEYED.  [END RECORDING]

   SINCE THE MILITARY BLOCKADE WENT INTO EFFECT, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE
HELICOPTERS HAVE BEEN OVERFLYING THE CAMPUS.

   CLANDESTINE, 15 JUL 89 (RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS IS OUR WAR BULLETIN FROM THE MODESTO RAMIREZ
CENTRAL FRONT IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   ON 15 JULY, GUERRILLAS BEGAN THE OPERATION CALLED WE WILL DEFEAT ARENA'S
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] DICTATORSHIP BY HITTING THE PUPPET
ARMY.  THIS OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST TWO POSITIONS OF THE 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE'S AZMITIA BATTALION STATIONED IN CHALATENANGO,
SPECIFICALLY AGAINST AN IRA [INSTITUTE OF SUPPLY REGULATION] CENTER IN SAN
JOSE EL CARAO, EL PARAISO.  THIS IS HOW THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT:

   SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ON THREE OF THE ARMY'S FORTIFIED
PERIPHERAL DEFENSE POSITIONS.  ONE OF THESE POSITIONS WAS COMPLETELY
DESTROYED, RESULTING IN 11 OF THE ENEMY KILLED.  FOUR ADDITIONAL CASUALTIES
WERE INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY IN THE THREE OTHER DEFENSE FORTIFICATIONS, WHICH
WERE ALSO DESTROYED.

   WE ALSO ATTACKED THE MAIN SUPPLY CENTER FACILITIES AND STORMED THREE
DEFENSIVE POSITIONS IN THE INTERIOR.  AS A RESULT OF THIS ATTACK, FOUR OF
THE ENEMY WERE KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED.  IN ADDITION, WE DESTROYED THE
OFFICES AND A GRAIN DRYER AND DAMAGED THE STORAGE BINS AND GRAIN STORAGE
AREAS.  WE CONCLUDED THE ATTACK BY SETTING THE ENTIRE FACILITY ON FIRE.

   THE FOLLOWING MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE ENEMY DURING THIS
VICTORIOUS OPERATION:  3 M-16 RIFLES, 3 FULL SETS [NOT FURTHER
IDENTIFIED], 1 M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER WITH 9 GRENADES, 550 5.56-MM ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION, 2 100-CARTRIDGE M-60 AMMUNITION BELTS, UNIFORMS, BOOTS, AND
OTHER MILITARY SUPPLIES.

   ONE HOUR AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN, THE ENEMY WAS REINFORCED BY A
ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTER, ONE PUSH-PULL O-2 AIRCRAFT, AND ONE C-47
AIRCRAFT.  IN ADDITION, THE ENEMY RECEIVED ARTILLERY SUPPORT FROM THE AREAS
ABOVE THE INSTALLATIONS UNDER ATTACK, BUT THIS FIRE AND THE AIR SUPPORT WERE
INEFFECTIVE.  THE C-47 AIRCRAFT STRAFED LAS PENAS, WITH COMPLETE DISREGARD
FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, A REPRESSIVE ACTION WE VEHEMENTLY DENOUNCE.

   LATER, AT 0300, THE ENEMY TROOPS WERE REINFORCED BY TWO ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIERS AND FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS, WHICH TOOK TROOPS TO A PLACE NEAR THE IRA
INSTALLATION.  THESE REINFORCEMENTS WERE QUICKLY NEUTRALIZED BY OUR RIFLE
FIRE.  IN ADDITION, THE OPERATION INCLUDED A LARGE NUMBER OF MILITIAMEN AND
REBEL TROOPS, WHO ERECTED ROADBLOCKS ON THE STREETS OF NUEVA CONCEPCION,
BLEW UP SIX TELEPHONE POSTS, PLACED A LARGE BANNER ACROSS THE STREET, AND
DISTRIBUTED PROPAGANDA.  OTHER PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES OCCURRED IN SAN JOSE
PATARES, LA SIEMBRE, GUAYABITO, AND HORCONES IN LA PALMA JUSRISDICTION.

   IN ALL, WE INFLICTED 24 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING DEAD AND WOUNDED, ON THE
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE; HOWEVER, WE LOST COMRADE OTONIEL IN THE ATTACK.

   [LOPEZ] YES, OF COURSE, WE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS.  THE COLOMBIAN POLICE
HAVE THE INFORMATION AND ARE WORKING BASED ON THIS.  

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT A RANSOM?  HAS THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT BEEN
CONTACTED?

   [LOPEZ] THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT.  WE ARE HOPING THERE WILL BE A CONTACT
SO THAT WE CAN PROCEED FROM THERE.

   [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE A RANSOM HAS BEEN DEMANDED?

   [LOPEZ] I HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.  I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT
HAS RECEIVED?

   [LOPEZ] WE WERE BRIEFED ON THE WORK BEING COORDINATED WITH THE COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES.  WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM, LIKE BROTHERS.  THE TWO
ARMIES AND THE AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

   [REPORTER] IF A RANSOM IS DEMANDED, IS THE GOVERNMENT WILLING TO PAY IT?

   [LOPEZ] I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION; THAT WOULD DEPEND ON RODRIGUEZ'
FAMILY.

   [REPORTER] THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH
KIDNAPPINGS.  WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THIS CASE?  WHAT DO THEY THINK THE
OUTCOME WILL BE?

   [LOPEZ] WE ALWAYS WORK BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CASES.  THIS
KIDNAPPING COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE REBELS, AND WE ALREADY KNOW
HOW THE REBELS OPERATE.  HE ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY COMMON
CRIMINALS.  EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM THAT THE CASE WOULD BE HANDLED SIMILARLY
IN BOTH INSTANCES, IT IS NOT SO.  WE ARE GOING TO WAIT A BIT LONGER.  WE
BELIEVE WE MAY GET MORE INFORMATION TODAY.

   [REPORTER] IT IS NOT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT POLICY TO PAY RANSOM IN CASES
SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WILL AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN THIS CASE?

   [LOPEZ] I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FOLLOW OUR POLICY.  THERE ARE MEANS THAT CAN
BE USED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING; THIS WOULD HAPPEN ONCE WE HAVE SPECIFIC

   ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, THE STUDENTS HELD A DEMONSTRATION LATE IN THE

AREA AND RELEASE STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.

   AFTER THE DEMONSTATION ENDED, EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD AND SOLDIERS BEGAN

[TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES TODAY STATED THAT THE
GANG-STYLE ACTION AKEN YESTERDAY BY SOME PEOPLE TO OCCUPY PRIVATE
PROPERTY WILL NOT INTIMIDATE THE GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN CACERES RECORDING] YESTERDAY, A WELL-ORGANIZED GROUP OF
APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USURP PRIVATE PROPERTY USING MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS, STONES AND FIREARMS.  THEIR ACTION CAUSED ONE UNFORTUNATE DEATH,
INJURIES, AND DAMAGE -- WHICH WERE REPORTED EARLIER -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF A
LARGE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES.

   IT IS PUBLICLY EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR CLOSEST ALLIES WERE
BEHIND THE PREPARATION, COORDINATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE CRIMINALS
ACTIONS.

   UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT FAIL TO LINK THESE ACTIONS TO THE THREATENING,
VIOLENT SPEECHES -- FOLLOWING THE STYLE USED BY THE POPULAR UNITY MEMBERS --
WITH WHICH SOME LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OPENED THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN OF THEIR CANDIDATE PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGARD THESE AGGRESSIONS AS SIGNALS AND WARNINGS
OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SOME POLITICAL
UMBRELLA GROUPS.  THESE GROUPS CONSIST OF SECTORS ADVOCATING A PEACEFUL
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND OTHER SECTORS THAT FOLLOW THE
LINE OF THOSE WHO IN THE PAST DESTROYED OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE ON THE
OTHER HAND.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS STATED ITS DECISION NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, IT CANNOT FAIL TO ANNOUNCE ITS POSITION AND TO STATE
ITS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF A MALICIOUS AND DEMAGOGICAL RHETORIC THAT POSES A
THREAT TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GOVERNMENT YIELD TO THOSE WHO TIME AND

MONDAY'S INCIDENTS NEAR EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE FMLN STATES:

   1. NONE OF OUR UNITS WERE OPERATING AROUND EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY OR THE

   2. THE CLASHES THAT OCCURRED NEAR THE UNIVERSITY WERE CARRIED OUT BY
ARMED FORCES TROOPS ALONE.  IN AN EFFORT TO SEARCH THE UNIVERSITY, THE
TROOPS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] AS STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS WERE
ENTERING THE CAMPUS.

COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROMOTING AGAINST EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.
THIS PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER
OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THE PLAN INVOLVES THREATS, ARRESTS, MURDERS,
AND OTHER REPRESSIVE ACTS.  

   4. IT IS PREDICTABLE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE TOP COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES WILL SAY THAT WHAT OCCURRED AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS THE
RESULT OF A CLASH BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN, AND THIS IS COMPLETELY
FALSE.  CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT CLAIMED SEVERAL VICTIMS IN THE AREA AROUND EL

RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS HAVE TRANSMISSION TOWERS ON THAT
MOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT TOWERS OVER A VAST AREA OF GUATEMALA.

GUERRILLA GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE "9 MAY" PEOPLE'S LIBERATION FORCES,
FPL, ANNOUNCED ITS EMERGENCE AS ONE OF THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLING
FOR POWER.

   THREE BOMBS WENT OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TEGUCIGALPA, ONE AT THE CENTRAL
PARK, ANOTHER AT THE STATE-RUN UNIVERSITY OF HONDURAS, AND ANOTHER AT A
TRAINING SCHOOL FOR TEACHERS.  AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A

   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO
HAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE
EXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE
NEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT "ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM"
AND ADDS THAT "TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS."

   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE
IN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA
ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO
HERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT "THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS
LEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER
COUNTRIES" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.

INCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,
LEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR
ACTIONS.

PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CCOP) AND THE UNITED
FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (FUTH) CHARGED YESTERDAY THAT THERE IS
A TERRORIST PLAN TO ELIMINATE EVERYONE WHO OPPOSES THE U.S. MILITARY
OCCUPATION OF THE COUNTRY.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE LEADERS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS SAID THAT THE
DEATH THREATS AGAINST LABOR AND THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS
PLAN, WHICH FORMS PART OF THE U.S. POLICY ON HONDURAS.  

   REFERRING TO THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN SAN PEDRO SULA, CCOP
COORDINATOR JUAN ALMENDARES BONILLA SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS AN OCCUPIED
COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS A U.S.-SPONSORED POLICY OF TERROR THAT SEEKS TO
ANNIHILATE ALL THE GROUPS THAT PROTEST THE VIOLATION OF NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY."

   HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF TERROR.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE
SAID ARMED GROUPS ARRIVE AT HOUSES AT NIGHT AND RAPE ENTIRE FAMILIES.
"THESE POLICIES OF TERROR HAVE BEEN USED IN BRAZIL, CHILE, VIETNAM, EL
SALVADOR, AND GUATEMALA, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES," HE SAID.  

   THE FORMER UNIVERSITY RECTOR SAID THAT THIS POLICY OF TERROR, WHICH HAS
RECENTLY BEEN INTENSIFIED, TRIES TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A
SUBVERSIVE CELL THAT IS DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY PRIOR TO THE HOLDING OF
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN TELA, ATLANTIDA DEPARTMENT.

   THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS SAID THAT "THE TERRORISM OF THE HONDURAN DEMOCRATIC
STATE IS ALSO SHOWN BY AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT IS EXTENSIVELY CONTROLLED
BY THE AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXECUTION OF POOR
HONDURANS BY REPRESSIVE FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY U.S. EXPERTS."

   THEY SAID THE TERRORISM IS ALSO DEMOSTRATED IN THE NONFULFILLMENT OF THE
ESQUIPULAS II PEACE AGREEMENTS, BY A POLICY THAT CAPITULATES TO THE IMF AND
THE WORLD BANK, THE MAINTENANCE OF EXTREME SECURITY, AND THE FACILITIES
GIVEN TO THE THE CONTRAS AND THE U.S. ARMY.

   AFTER MAKING THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS, THE FUTH AND THE CCOP ASKED THE
GOVERNMENT TO HALT STATE TERRORISM AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE POLITICAL CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS.  THEY ALSO DEMANDED
THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS BE RESPECTED, THAT THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION'S REPORT ON REPRESSION BE MADE KNOWN, AND THAT THE NICARAGUAN
CONTRAS BE DEMOBILIZED.

   THEY ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE STATE CARRY OUT A REAL POLICY OF
DEMOCRATIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM
THE IMF, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY.

   THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ADOPT A PATRIOTIC POSITION SO THAT
THE U.S. BASES AND THE CONTRAS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM HONDURAS BECAUSE THEY
CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   THE CCOP AND THE FUTH ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE SCHEDULED "A GREAT
MARCH FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY" THIS AFTERNOON TO MARK THE HEROIC DEEDS OF
LEMPIRA, THE DEFENDER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND DIGNITY.

   THE MARCH WILL BEGIN AT 1600 AT THE COMAYAGUELA OBELISK AND END AT
TEGUCIGALPA'S MAIN SQUARE.

   THE DEMONSTRATION WILL ALSO DEMAND THE REJECTION OF THE IMF AND WORLD
BANK'S PROPOSALS, THE EXPULSION OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AND RESPECT FOR
THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.

ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION-CAMILIST UNION (UC-ELN) TODAY CARRIED OUT ITS
SIXTH ATTACK THIS YEAR AGAINST THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE, WHICH LINKS THE
COLOMBIAN TOWNS OF ORITO AND TUMACO NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-ECUADORAN BORDER.  

   THE REBELS USED EXPLOSIVES TO BLOW UP 1 METER OF PIPELINE. THIS IS THE
REBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989.  THE
AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE
ATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE.

   A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI
MEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE
GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE
CONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN
LAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN
COLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED
APPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE.

   IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE
DINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO
APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM
THE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.

ON THIS OCCASION TO GIVE YOU MY FIRST REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE
COUNTRY.  I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER.  AT THIS
TIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR
SITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE
FUTURE.  EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT.
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE.

   THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE
A GOVERNMENT:  TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY,
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS.

   WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS
ASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE
PROBLEMS.  I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY,
STUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE
PROBLEM.  WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A
MISTAKE.  THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK.

   BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE
COUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND
THAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.  

   FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND
INDISCRIMINATE MURDERS.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE
EXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO
THE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE.

   WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE
EVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN
TO PROTECT EVERYONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY
IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER.  THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE
GROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS.  THEY CLAIM THAT
THE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER.  DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US
ANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.

   THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE
LAW IS BROKEN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC
ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY
CREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE
ACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION.  WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO
DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
THEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A
COMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL
MANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN
OUR HISTORY.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT,
SAID ON 1 JUNE.  ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND
TALK.  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN
MISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE. [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] SMUGGLING CAN BE HELD IN CHECK ONLY WITH MEASURES
SUCH AS THESE.  WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO TAKE THE SEVEREST ACTIONS
AGAINST THOSE WHO SMUGGLE MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY.  AN
INVESTIGATION IS WELL UNDER WAY INTO A CORPORATION WHICH HAS BEEN
SMUGGLING MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY.  THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
WILL SOON BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.  WE WANT TO
WARN ALL THOSE WHO SOMEHOW HAVE SMUGGLED OR WHO ARE PLANNING TO
SMUGGLE THAT THEY SHOULD STOP THIS ACTIVITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT
SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES CORRUPTION AND THAT CORRUPTION IS A CRIME OF
HIGH TREASON.  WE CANNOT ALLOW CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE WILL
TAKE HARSH ACTIONS AGAINST EVERY TYPE OF CORRUPTION, INCLUDING
SMUGGLING.  I AM ASKING THOSE WHO MIGHT BE APPROACHED BY UNSCRUPULOUS
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE IN THEIR POSSESSION SMUGGLED GOODS TO REFRAIN
FROM PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS.  LET US NOT PROMOTE SMUGGLING.  I AM
ASKING ALL GOOD SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN NOT TO PURCHASE ANY SMUGGLED
GOODS.  SMUGGLING CONSTITUTES AN ATTACK AGAINST OUR HOMELAND AND
ENCOURAGES CORRUPTION, WHICH MUST BE ERADICATED FROM OUR COUNTRY.

   REGARDING OUR FISCAL POLICY, WE MUST TRY TO DETERMINE WAYS TO MORE
DIRECTLY MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVENUE AND DISBURSEMENTS IN THE
COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THIS FISCAL DEFICIT IN TWO WAYS --
WE MUST EITHER INCREASE OUR REVENUE OR LOWER OUR DISBURSEMENTS.  THIS
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN AUSTERITY MEASURES REGARDING THE LATTER.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN EXPENDITURES AT THE CURRENT
LEVEL, BUT TO REDUCE THEM BY 15 PERCENT.  WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT'S AUSTERITY MEASURES MUST BE GENUINE AND SHOULD BE AIMED AT
MAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF SCANT RESOURCES.  THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE MORE
EFFICIENT, THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  AFTER ALL, IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY OUR SALARIES AND PROVIDE THE
REVENUE THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE.

   WE MUST SPEND OUR MONEY WISELY.  ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES MUST
GUARD AGAINST CORRUPTION.  WE MUST TAKE PAINS TO SERVE THE POPULATION AND TO
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING AND
DESERVE.  ONLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN EFFICIENTLY, WHEN ITS ACTIONS ARE
CRYSTAL CLEAR, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT RIDS ITSELF OF CORRUPTION, AND WHEN THE
MONEY THAT THE TAXPAYERS PAY IS USED FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, WILL WE BE
ABLE TO ELICIT A POSITIVE REACTION FROM THE TAXPAYERS.  THEY HAVE TO PAY
TAXES.  WHEN TAXES ARE SQUANDERED, MISUSED, OR STOLEN, NO ONE WILL PAY THEM
WILLINGLY.  IF WE, AS THE GOVERNMENT, ACT HONESTLY, SERVE THE NATION WELL,
AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT THE MAJORITY, ONLY DISLOYAL SALVADORANS
WILL BE UNWILLING TO PAY TAXES.  [CONTINUED]

SECOND, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HEALTH.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY
SHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS
WITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE
HAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE
PURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR
WILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST
PROVIDE.

   THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY
NEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES.  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED
FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS.  WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL
YEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH
THE MATERIAL THEY NEED.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
CAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE.

   FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL
ANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES.  THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN
ENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND
WILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.

   WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN.  THIS PLAN WILL BE
IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE
HIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200
COMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT
TO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT
PROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES.  WE WILL PROVIDE
THEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE
WILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE
EXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE
BUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL
- SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.  I REPEAT:  THIS
SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER.  IN THE NEXT FEW
WEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS
THAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN.

   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO
ABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE
THE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.  WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN
OFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT
VIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT
FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT
CRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE
SPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO
IMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT.  THIS PLAN HAS SOME
SPECIFIC GOALS:  FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE
UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH
FOR THESE PEOPLE.  THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE
WILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN
EMPLOYMENT.  I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN
DURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS
AN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS. [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA] [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT UNIDENTIFIED MEN
SET OFF BOMBS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JOSE SIMEON CANAS UNIVERSITY,
UCA, LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 0200.  ONE
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ONE BUS, AND ONE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WERE DAMAGED
AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF AT LEAST FOUR BOMBS THAT WENT OFF INSIDE THE
UCA CAMPUS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS CONDEMNED THIS KIND OF ATTACK, WHICH IS
USUALLY CARRIED OUT BY CERTAIN GROUPS THAT OPPOSE PEACE. THE ARMED FORCES
BELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND
POLITICAL PROBLEMS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST
CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND
SAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, FROM THIS VERY MOMENT, THE
ARMED FORCES REJECT ANY ACCUSATION IMPLICATING THEM IN THE ATTACK AGAINST
UCA, WHICH TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 JUL 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [SPEECH] [SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR PEASANT FRIENDS:

   FROM THE VERY 1ST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE PLEDGED OUR FULL
COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL PROGRAMS AND HAVE SAID THAT "AT NO TIME AND FOR NO
REASON WILL WE FORGET THE MANY NEEDY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY -- THAT IS, THE
NOBLE AND LONG-SUFFERING PEASANTS, WHO ARE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST
VIOLENCE."  

   THIS CEREMONY REAFFIRMS OUR GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE AGRARIAN
REFORM.

   WE WANT YOU TO REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR WORDS THROUGH OUR DEEDS.
THIS PRESENTATION OF 8,000 PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES
OF DECREE 207 -- THROUGH THE NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FOR AGRICULTURAL
LANDS (FINATA) -- REFLECTS OUR OBJECTIVES.

   WE HAVE CATEGORICALLY SAID THAT WE WILL NOT TURN BACK THE AGRARIAN REFORM
PROCESS.  QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, WE WANT TO FULLY SUPPORT IT IN ORDER TO
GUARANTEE THAT PEASANTS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM ARE FREE TO
CHOOSE THE KIND OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE GREAT FREEDOMS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS
OF THE REPUBLIC.

   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHER
PEASANTS ARE INDEED BENEFITED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM AND THAT THEY WILL NOT
BE USED AS A DEMAGOGICAL BANNER AT THE SERVICE OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, AS WAS
THE CASE UNTIL RECENTLY.  WE WANT PEASANTS' WELFARE TO BE THE OBJECTIVE OF
OUR AGRARIAN REFORM; WE WANT AGRARIAN REFORM TO DEVELOP WITHIN A LEGAL,
HONEST, AND PATRIOTIC FRAMEWORK.

   WE ARE AGAINST THE DEMAGOGUERY OF STATIC PATERNALISM, BECAUSE WE WANT
PEASANTS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FATE, TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR
PRODUCTION UNITS' DECISIONMAKING PROCESS, IN THE MARKETING OF THEIR
PRODUCTS, AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE.

   IT IS NEITHER FAIR NOR CORRECT, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST, TO
BENEFIT OFFICE WORKERS, WHO HAVE NEVER SWEATED IN THE FIELDS UNDER THE
AGRARIAN REFORM, WHEN YOU -- THE PEASANTS -- ARE NOW FACING DEBTS AND ARE
WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE YOU OWNED LAND.

   OUR GOVERNMENT AND YOU WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE THIS SITUATION TO ENSURE
THAT YOU WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY WORK YOUR LAND, KNOWING THAT THE FRUIT OF
YOUR LABOR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT YOUR FAMILIES.  WE ARE SURE THAT WITH
EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION, PROMPT CREDIT, ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND
THE HARDWORKING LEGACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE WILL TURN THE AGRARIAN
REFORM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL
BENEFIT ALL SALVADORANS BY PROMOTING PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

   DEAR PEASANTS:

   WE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK WITH YOU.  THROUGH THE RELEVANT
ORGANIZATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE
THE SALVADORAN PEASANTS' CONDITIONS.  

   THROUGH FINATA, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF MORE LAND
FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THOUSANDS OF PEASANT FAMILIES.

   DEAR FRIENDS:

   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE PEACE, BECAUSE WE ARE AWARE THAT
THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE DISTURBS THE CALM AND NORMAL PROCEDURE OF
RURAL ACTIVITIES; WE REALIZE THAT WE MUST END THE VIOLENCE SO THAT WE CAN
ALL GO BACK TO WORK AND BRING ABOUT A NATIONAL RECOVERY.  PEASANTS HAVE
SUFFERED THE MOST THROUGHOUT THE CONFLICT UNLEASHED BY THE TERRORIST
MARXIST-LENINIST GROUPS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO SEEK THE
PEACE THAT WE ALL WANT IN ORDER TO RESTORE SOCIAL HARMONY, MUTUAL RESPECT,
AND FRATERNAL LOVE AMONG ALL SALVADORANS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.  

   ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY
PLEASED TO PRESENT THESE PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF
DECREE 207.  WE CONGRATULATE AND INVITE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO
HELP THE FATHERLAND RECOVER FROM THE CRISIS AND TO BUILD FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND ALL SALVADORANS A FUTURE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, AND PROGRESS.

   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] LIMA TELEVISION PERUANA
NETWORK IN SPANISH 1733 GMT ON 28 JULY, CONTINUING ITS LIVE COVERAGE
OF FESTIVITIES ON THE OCCASION OF PERUVIAN NATIONAL DAY, BROADCASTS A
SPEECH TO THE NATION BY PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA LIVE FROM THE
NATIONAL CONGRESS CHAMBER IN LIMA.

   PRESIDENT GARCIA NOTES THAT HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN A TESTIMONY OF FAITH
TO DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROVIDES THE
FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNING A FREE PERU.  NOTING THAT THIS SPEECH IS HIS LAST
MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY FROM CONGRESS, GARCIA BEGINS TO COMMENT ON THE
ACHIEVEMENTS AND EVENTS OF HIS LAST YEAR IN OFFICE.  AFTER STRESSING THE
IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION TO OVERCOME PROBLEMS OF THE ECONOMY
AND OF VIOLENCE, GARCIA DECLARES:  "I AM HEREBY CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS
TO CHOOSE PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON 8 APRIL 1990.  APPLAUSE

   "I WOULD LIKE TO REMARK THAT I AM A POLITICIAN, THAT I PARTICIPATE IN
DEBATES, AND THAT MY LIFE IS INDEBTED TO THE APRA [AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] MOVEMENT.  YET AS PRESIDENT I HAVE A MAJOR SACRED
MISSION, THAT OF GUARANTEEING THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR
AND CLEAN."

   GARCIA NOTES THAT THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE REPLACED AND THAT THE
NATIONAL MEDIA ARE FROM THIS MOMENT ON PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE
CANDIDATES.  HE CALLS ON THE ARMED FORCES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.

   THE PRESIDENT CALLS ON PERUVIAN YOUTH TO ESCHEW VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF
EDUCATION AND WORKING TOWARD PROMOTING DEMOCRACY.

   GARCIA THEN TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION OF REGIONALIZATION,
NOTING THAT MANY GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING REORGANIZED TO BETTER
SERVE THE PEOPLE.  WHEN EACH REGION HAS ITS OWN ELECTED OFFICIALS, HE SAYS,
THE PEOPLE WILL EXERT MORE CONTROL OVER OFFICIALS' ACTIVITIES, AND
CORRUPTION WILL BE REDUCED.  PERU WILL NOT NEED TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL
SOLUTIONS TO ITS NATIONAL PROBLEMS.

   AFTER CALLING ON THE JUSTICE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO IMPROVE ITS
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, GARCIA ANNOUNCES: "I HEREBY CALL ELECTIONS --
FOLLOWING A CONSULTATION WITH THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT -- FOR REGIONAL
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GRAU REGION, CREATED ON 1 MARCH 1988, MADE
UP OF THE FOLLOWING PROVINCES: TUMBES, CONTRALMIRANTE VILLAR, ZARUMILLA,
HUANCABAMBA, MORROPON, PAITA, SULLANA, TALARA, AYABACA, AND PIURA ON 12
NOVEMBER 1989."  GARCIA ALSO ISSUES AN OFFICIAL CALL FOR 12 NOVEMBER
ELECTIONS IN THE AMAZONAS, AREQUIPA, AND MOQUEGUA-TACNA-PUNO REGIONS.

   AT 1801 GMT GARCIA BEGINS TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT OF TERRORISM AND
VIOLENCE.  HE CALLS ON THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS ALL POLTIICAL PARTIES TO
SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES IN PUTTING AN END TO VIOLENCE.  HE PROPOSES THAT
TERRORISTS BE TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS.  

   ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN PERU, PRESIDENT GARCIA
REITERATES THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN RESERVES
AS WELL AS REACTIVATING THE PRODUCTION SECTOR.  HE NOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF
FURTHER DEVELOPING AGRICULTURE AND PETROLEUM.  HE REVIEWS THE PUBLIC WORKS
PROJECTS, INCLUDING IRRIGATION AND RURAL ELECTRICIFICATION WORKS, THAT HAVE
BEEN INITIATED OR COMPLETED DURING HIS PRESIDENCY.

   GARCIA CALLS ON THE PEOPLE NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY TERRORISM,
SENSATIONALISM, OR PESSIMISM.  NOTING THAT THE PEOPLE ARE PERU'S MOST
IMPORTANT RESOURCE, THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR IMPROVING THE SOCIAL WELFARE
SECTOR.  HE DENIES THE RUMOR THAT SECTOR WILL BE PRIVATIZED.

   GARCIA ENDS HIS SPEECH AT 1851 GMT.


DEV-MUC3-0313 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   BUENOS AIRES, 28 JUL 89 (ARGENTINA TELEVISORA COLOR NETWORK) --
[SPEECH] [ALVARO ALSOGARAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ON FOREIGN DEBT
MATTERS] [EXCERPTS] GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  TODAY WE WILL
DISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM.  THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A
BIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL
ARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,
CONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN
DEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.

   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS
REPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE
ARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6
BILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND
TO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.

   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN
INTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.

   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN
THE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME
ECONOMY MINISTER [MARCH 1976], THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.
WHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE
MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND
INCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.
ALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.
SO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.

   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT
EVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN
PAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR
DEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING
ANYTHING.

   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS
THE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.

   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE
INTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST
CATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL
CREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY
NEEDS.

   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL
BANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A
CRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.

   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE
EXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY
CHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE
CANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.

   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO
PRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR
ABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE
NOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF
INTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE
BEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.

   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN
HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT
THAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED
WORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  

   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST
OF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS
OWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF
THE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,
FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.

   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO
PAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE
ISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
OBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
INTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND
PROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE
THERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE
COUNTRY IS AT STAKE.

   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW
THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,
FISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN
ARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.
WE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.

   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?
WE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE
IN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL
IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE
TAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE
ALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST
REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
FROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD
OR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE
MATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO
HAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,
MEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A
PERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS
MATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,
DOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS
NOR THE COUNTRY.

   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT
BANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE
SECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN
BE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED
IT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,
DEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE
WITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS
WERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE
REINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC
POWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL
SYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS
$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE
GUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN
DISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL
LEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.
NEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER
WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE
THEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE
IS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS
A CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT
MOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO
THIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO
BRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE
BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.

   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE
COUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT
THE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON
CONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS
IS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE
ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE
MEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY
RECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE
LIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.

   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPTS] MR PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, GENTLEMEN
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS:

   TEN YEARS AGO, THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY PRESIDED OVER BY
HAYA DE LA TORRE, CALLING UP ON LORD GOD FOR STRENGTH AND IN KEEPING WITH
THE POWERS VESTED IN US BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, APPROVED THE
NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING COMES FIRST AND THAT
ALL HONORABLE PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSALLY VALID RIGHTS.  THUS WE DECIDED TO WORK
FOR A FREE AND JUST SOCIETY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE
BASED ON POPULAR WILL AND ON THE FREE, PERIODIC CONSULTATION OF THIS WILL.

   WE BET ON CIVILIZED COEXISTENCE AS A WAY OF LAUNCHING A PROCESS BASED ON
STABLE AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS, HOWEVER,
WERE SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 1, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL'S BASIC RIGHTS
AND DUTIES FOR THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PERSONALITY.

   OUR CONSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE ACHIEVED AMONG VARIOUS AND
SOMETIMES ANTAGONISTIC POLITICAL FORCES.  THUS, SOME OF ITS ECONOMIC
ARTICLES MAY SEEM VAGUE. HOWEVER, UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION ANY IDEOLOGY CAN
GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND MAKE CHANGES IN ANY DIRECTION WHATSOEVER, AS LONG AS
THOSE FIRST CONDITIONS AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS ARE RESPECTED. [PASSAGE
OMITTED]

   THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER TO CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT BEFORE I
TURN THE PRESIDENCY OVER TO A CITIZEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.

   I CANNOT FAIL TO EXPAND ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE THIS YEAR, WHICH,
HONESTLY SPEAKING ARE MUCH FEWER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM DELIVERING A
SUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION,
FOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS.

   IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE
GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF
DEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS
FREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY
POSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM.
VIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM.  THE NATION HAS MORE
LEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM.

   LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY
THINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE.
DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS
SLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY
DEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM
SAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC
CRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES
AT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE.

   WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF
OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID
THAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS
BY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.

   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF
THOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING
THIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY
AND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES,
SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES
LEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE
INSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A
DICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED
POWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE.

   I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL
PERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
BY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE
DEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE
DEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.

   THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. I AM COMMITTED TO MORE FREEDOM AND
MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES WE DOUBT BECAUSE OF EXCESSES.
BUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION ABUSE WILL PREVAIL. [CONTINUED]

PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO SAID TODAY THAT DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER
AMBASSADOR AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC],
WAS THE "VICTIM OF THE POLITICAL INTOLERANCE OF GROUPS WHO DO NOT WANT
TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACY."

   IN STATEMENTS TO NEWSMEN, CEREZO SAID THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING
BARILLAS "ARE EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS SEEKING TO DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS BEGUN ON 14 JANUARY 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES.

   POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT BARILLAS, AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN DURING THE
FIRST 2 YEARS OF CEREZO'S ADMINISTRATION, WHICH BEGAN IN 1986, WAS GUNNED
DOWN BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AS HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL AFTER TAKING ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS TO A NEARBY BUS STOP.

   OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ATTACKERS, WHO WERE TRAVELING IN TWO
VEHICLES WITH TINTED WINDOWS, HAD BEEN WAITING FOR BARILLAS SINCE VERY EARLY
IN THE MORNING.  DE POLITICAL LEADER MANAGED TO AVOID THE FIRST SHOTS THAT
WERE FIRED AT HIM AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER A PARKED CAR, WHERE THE ASSAILANTS
PUMPED 6 ROUNDS INTO HIM.

   BARILLAS, 50, WAS SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PDC FROM 1970 TO 1974.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO AND ALFONSO CABRERA, PDC SECRETARY AND
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL FOR THAT PARTY, WENT TO BARILLAS' HOME WHERE THEY
VEHEMENTLY CONDEMNED THE CRIME.

   CABRERA TERMED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING "COWARDS," AND SAID THAT
THE CRIME IS PART OF A TERRORIST WAVE THAT HAS GRIPPED GUATEMALA FOR OVER 15
DAYS.  

   BARILLAS WAS A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN DELEGATION THAT PARTICIPATED IN A
MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG)
HELD IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR TO THAT
EUROPEAN COUNTRY.

   AFTER LEAVING THAT POST LAST YEAR HE WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO AS

SALVADOR TO COUNTER A NEW GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, WHICH HAS CAUSED AT
LEAST 48 MILITARY CASUALTIES OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS IN SEVERAL ACTIONS
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   TREASURY POLICE DIRECTOR COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ REPORTED THAT THE
STATE OF ALERT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT SABOTAGE AND THE DELIVERY OF WEAPONS
FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  IT INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN LAND AND AIR PATROLS AND
SEARCHES OF BUSES AND PRIVATE VEHICLES.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN
LAUNCHED TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST ECONOMIC MEASURES, INCLUDING THE
DEREGULATION OF STAPLE PRICES, THE PRIVATIZATION OF COFFEE EXPORTS AND
BANKING ACTIVITIES, AND AN INCREASE IN BUS FARES AND ELECTRICITY BILLS.

   COL HERNANDEZ SAID: "THE GOVERNMENT WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PEOPLE, SO
LAND TRANSPORTATION USERS WILL LOGICALLY BE AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE, BUT
BUSINESSMEN ARE ALSO TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS."

   A CLANDESTINE REBEL STATION ASSERTED THAT THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN
MORAZAN, USULUTAN, METAPAN, SAN MIGUEL, CABANAS, SAN VICENTE, LA PAZ, SAN
SALVADOR, AND THE CONFLICT-RIDDEN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE ARMED FORCES CLAIMED THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES OR THE CLASHES ANNOUNCED BY THE FMLN AND ASSERTED THAT, CONTRARY
TO THE FMLN REPORT, THREE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS HAD DIED AND FIVE HAD BEEN
KILLED IN VARIOUS CLASHES THAT OCCURRED IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN TOWNS, AND
IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL.  

   NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMY RECOGNIZED THAT TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO CIVILIANS HAD

FINANCING AND MASTERMINDING THE MURDERS OF POLITICAL LEADERS] AND OTHER WELL

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JUL 89 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] "I DO NOT WANT TO
INTERFERE AT ALL.  THE JUDGE WILL PRONOUNCE THE VERDICT; MEANWHILE, I
WILL WAIT AND KEEP SILENT," MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID YESTERDAY REGARDING HIS BROTHER SHORTLY
AFTER ENDING SUNDAY'S [30 JULY] HOMILY AT THE CATHEDRAL.

   THE PRELATE WAS REFERRING TO THE ARREST OF SALOMON ENRIQUE ROSA CHAVEZ,
WHO WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND
ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ERP).  THE FIRST
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ORDERED HIS TEMPORARY ARREST FOLLOWING A 72 - HOUR
PERIOD, AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW FOR CRIMES OF BEARING COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS
AND FOR BRIBERY; THESE CRIMES DO NOT REQUIRE A PRISON SENTENCE.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I HAVE REMAINED SILENT OUT OF RESPECT FOR
THE LEGAL PROCESS, WHICH IS STILL UNDER WAY.  MY BROTHER IS STILL IN PRISON,
AND THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO END," HE SAID.  THE
PRISONER WAS NOT RELEASED ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WILL BE RELASED ON MONDAY, 7
AUGUST.

   ASKED BY REPORTERS IF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIS BROTHER WOULD HURT HIS
[MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ'S] IMAGE OR THAT OF THE CHURCH, HE SAID THAT THE CHURCH'S
DUTY TO THE COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO FULFILL BUT THAT THE CHURCH'S EFFORTS
MUST CONTINUE, BECAUSE THE HUGE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS WHO COME TO THE
CATHEDRAL EVERY SUNDAY TO EASE THEIR PAINS CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

   "A SHEPHERD SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FLOCK, AND, WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS,
WE WILL CALMLY DEAL WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR MISSION," HE SAID.

   THE PRELATE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES THAT
AROSE DURING THE WEEK, SUCH AS THE CHARGES AND THE COUNTERCHARGES.  HE SAID
THAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING IS THE "CASE OF MSGR ROMERO," WHOSE MEMORY
CONTINUES TO INSPIRE MANY AND IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE MASTERMINDS AND
PERPETRATORS OF HIS ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION.  

   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE,
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION MEMBERS, AND WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES.  ROSA
CHAVEZ REFERRED TO THE CHARGES FILED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL DR MAURICIO ERNESTO
COLORADO, WHO LAST WEEK ASKED THE FIRST TREASURY COURT JUDGE TO DRAW UP AN
INDICTMENT AGAINST JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, AND A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I GREATLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS
ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF -- I ACCUSE YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME, AND WE ACCUSE EACH
OTHER.  THAT IS NO WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS, BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR LEADERS
TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SERIOUS.  OTHERWISE, WHAT WILL THOSE OF US WHO
ARE UNDERLINGS LEARN?  THAT IS WHY I HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL OF US
TO HELP CLEAR THE AIR SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PEACE FOR WHICH WE ALL
YEARN."

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ CONGRATULATED ALL JOURNALISTS IN HIS HOMILY AND SAID:
"I REMIND ALL JOURNALISTS -- AS POPE JOHN PAUL II ONCE SAID -- THAT NEWS, IF
ONE THINKS ABOUT IT, IS NEVER IMPARTIAL, BECAUSE IT AT LEAST INTENTIONALLY
AND IMPLICITLY RESPONDS TO IMPORTANT MATTERS.  JOURNALISM PROVIDES AN
INTIMATE LINK BETWEEN THE NEWS, EDUCATION, AND ESSENTIAL VALUES.  ALMOST ALL
MEN AND WOMEN WORKING FOR THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION MEDIA MUST TRY TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.  HOWEVER, EACH DAY THEY NEED COURAGE AND MUST HAVE
MUCH LOVE FOR THIS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY, SO THAT THEY WILL
REMAIN LOYAL TO THE VALUES OF THEIR PROFESSION.  THAT IS WHY OUR
CONGRATULATION MESSAGE BECOMES A PRAYER FOR THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM AND
HELP THEM NOT TO GIVE IN DURING DIFFICULT TIMES."

UNIDENTIFIED MEN.  

   THE AUTHORITIES DISCLOSED TODAY THAT LOPEZ, WHO WORKED AT THE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT'S IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 AUGUST
AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY TODAY.  

   LOPEZ' DEATH IS ONE MORE PDC LEADER MURDERED.  DANILO BARILLAS, ANOTHER
PDC LEADER, WAS KILLED ON 1 AUGUST, APPARENTLY BY EXTREME RIGHTIST GROUPS.

   SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE TWO KILLINGS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THIS CASE WHICH WAS NOT DISCLOSED
UNTIL TODAY.

   UNOFFICIAL SOURCES NOTED THAT IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TWO LEADERS KNEW
TOO MANY DETAILS AND POSSIBLY NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN COCAINE
TRAFFICKING.

   HOWEVER, LOPEZ' RELATIVES REJECTED THAT HIS MURDER HAD ANY CONNECTION
WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DISCOVERED AT THE AIRPORT THIS WEEK.

   SECURITY FORCES FOUND 22 KG OF COCAINE IN A SUITCASE OWNED BY JOSE
FERNANDO MINRO NAVAS, AN OFFICIAL OF THE PRESIDENCY'S ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT, ON 1 AUGUST.  MINRO WAS CAPTURED AND TURNED OVER TO A COURT.

RIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE [CODEH] HAS PREDICTED THAT THE TELA SUMMIT
WILL BE CHAOTIC BECAUSE, IN HIS OPINION, THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENTS WILL INTERFERE.  THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT
THE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND
ITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS
DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE
HERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE
OF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.

   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY
AT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO
GARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS
SO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW
CALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO
TESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED
SALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.

   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE
BRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS
ASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW
SERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.

   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL
MENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN
WAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF
NATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT
ALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN
ISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE
EXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD
REPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS
THAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS
THE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF
HONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE
THEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS
SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[END RECORDING]

   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON
CUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED
HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY
HANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.
HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.

   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT
BATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE
UNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE
MAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,
WHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY
CARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS
TO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS
ALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN
HIS STATEMENTS.  I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE MIND.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
REPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY?

   [COL SUAREZ] EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU.

   [REPORTER] I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT
INFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE
COUNTRY?

   [COL SUAREZ] LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM
TALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN
PEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS
CONTINUE.  THE POLICE ARREST PEOPLE BASED ON THE SUSPICION OR HARD,
RATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS.  I
BELIEVE YOU WILL SOON HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE PERSONS WHO HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.  [END RECORDING]

PEOPLE GUIDED BY THE RESPECTED MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE FOUNDER OF THE GREAT

OBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT MYSELF.  THE MAIN POINT IN THE DOCUMENT IS THAT WE
PROPOSE THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS.  THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE WE
DISCUSSED.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT ONCE THE CONTRAS ARE DISMANTLED, THERE
WILL BE AN AMNESTY, AND PRISONERS REMAINING IN NICARAGUA WILL BE RELEASED.
WE ALSO STRESSED THAT FOREIGN FORCES SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTION PROCESS; THE CIA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MEDDLE IN THE
NICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THIS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE U.S.  CONGRESS.
THEREFORE, WE ARE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR
NICARAGUAN SOVEREIGNTY.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONCERNING [WORDS INDISTINCT].
HOWEVER, IS IT NOT ALSO NECESSARY TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS?

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU SAY?  THAT WE MUST TALK TO THE CONTRAS?

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO TALK TO THE
CONTRAS?  

   [ORTEGA] WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS TO FIND
OUT HOW THEY CAN BE DISLODGED [FROM HONDURAS] AND RETURN TO NICARAGUA;
OR WE MUST DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY HERE IN HONDURAS --
BECAUSE SOME MAY WANT TO STAY IN HONDURAS AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO GO
ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS TO THE UNITED STATES.  I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED
STATES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES PROMOTED THE CONTRAS.  THE UNITED
STATES SHOULD NOT PLACE THIS BURDEN ON HONDURAS OR ON THE OTHER
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THEREFORE, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS
WITH THE CONTRAS TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE, TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE IN
AN ORDERLY MANNER AND NOT BY SHOOTING AT THEM.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THE CONTRAS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES.  

   [ORTEGA] GUARANTEES ALREADY EXIST IN NICARAGUA.  

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER ORTEGA, DO YOU HELP THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]?  

   [ORTEGA] WHAT?  

   [REPORTER] DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN?  

   [ORTEGA] WE ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAID IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT NICARAGUA
PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN.  THIS WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY
NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO.

   [ANNOUNCER] THE STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER DANIEL ORTEGA HAVE BEEN
INTERRUPTED BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO
TAKE OFF FROM THE TELA AIRPORT.  AT THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER
IS ASKING MR ORTEGA TO GO TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS
TRYING TO CONVINCE ORTEGA TO STOP MAKING STATEMENTS, BUT MR ORTEGA SEEMS
VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  AT THIS MOMENT,
PRESIDENT ORTEGA CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY LOCAL AND
FOREIGN NEWSMEN BECAUSE THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF.

   [REPORTER] MR ORTEGA...  

   [ORTEGA] INTERRUPTING CONCERNING YOUR QUESTION A FEW MINUTES AGO
REGARDING THE FMLN.  I JUST HELD A MEETING; I JUST HELD A MEETING WITH
THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  THEY ARE TOURING THE AREA, AND I HAVE MET
THEM.  THEY GAVE ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, USING AS A BASIS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE FMLN HAS
HELD WITH THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FLMN
RECENTLY MET WITH THE LEGALLY REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE FMLN HAS MET WITH SOCIAL GROUPS, AND, AFTER THESE
TALKS, THEY MADE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL: TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO REACH A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE
ENDURING.  OUR DESIRE IS TO SUPPORT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION -- AS
ESTABLISHED IN THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS - - TO FIND A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION TO THIS KIND OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]

   TEGUCIGALPA, 4 AUG 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE HONDURAN ARMY REPORTED
TODAY THAT IT DISMANTLED A SALVADORAN GUERRILLA CELL THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF
PROVIDING LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND TRANSPORTATION OF WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUA TO
EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY.  

   DURING MILITARY ACTIONS THAT BEGAN ON 29 JULY, ONE OF THE GUERRILLAS WAS
KILLED AND SIX WERE ARRESTED.  THREE OF THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE
SALVADORAN CITIZENS AND THE OTHER THREE WERE HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO
DOCUMENTS THEY WERE CARRYING.

   THE DETAINEES WERE MEMBERS OF A CELL THAT TRANSPORTED WEAPONS TO THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR
FROM NORTHERN NICARAGUA THROUGH EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND WESTERN HONDURAS.  

   THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ALSO TRANSPORTED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, LITERATURE, AND
FOOD, RAN SMALL BUSINESSES IN HONDURAS THAT SERVED AS "FRONTS," A MILITARY
SOURCE SAID.

   ACCORDING TO HONDURAN ARMY SPOKESMAN COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, THE
DETAINEES ARE IN COURT CUSTODY, AND 71 AK-47 RIFLES, RAMRODS, BAYONETS, AND
OTHER EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS PROOF AGAINST THEM.

   COL SUAREZ CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF "SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS THAT WE ARE
INVESTIGATING WITH A VIEW TO DISMANTLING THEM."

   THE OFFICER SAID THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN PROVEN IF THE WEAPONS ARE SUPPLIED
TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT "BECAUSE SO FAR WE ONLY KNOW THAT THE WEAPONS ARE TRANSPORTED
FROM NICARAGUA TO EL SALVADOR THROUGH HONDURAS."

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 6 AUG 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA HAS SAID IN LA PAZ, BOLIVIA THAT PANAMA
IS LIKE A COUNTRY BEING INVADED WITHOUT A SHOT BEING FIRED.  THAT IS
HOW THE PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE PERMANENT U.S. INVASION ON
PANAMANIAN TERRITORY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. SOLDIERS PERMANENTLY VIOLATE
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND FREQUENTLY OCCUPY UNAUTHORIZED ZONES
WITH TANKS AND SOLDIERS.

   SOLIS PALMA ALSO SAID PANAMA HAS AVOIDED PROVOCATIONS SO THAT THE
INVADERS CANNOT JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS, BUT IN CASE OF A CONFRONTATION, THE
PEOPLE AND THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES ARE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY.

   AS FOR PANAMA'S INTERNAL SITUATION, SOLIS PALMA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT IS
DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL GROUPS SO THAT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN BE CREATED
BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE CANAL BELONGS TO PANAMA AND NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT BE VIOLATED.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 AUG 89 (RADIO AMERICA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] WHAT IS THE PREVAILING ATMOSPHERE NOW?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK THAT ALL OF THE PRESIDENTS ARE HOPING THAT AN
AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WORKING ON THAT
AGREEMENT SO THAT A FINAL AGREEMENT CAN BE ISSUED. WE HAVE PREPARED
DOCUMENTS ON WHICH, I WOULD SAY, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS--SUCH AS
ON THE DOCUMENT ON THE [WORD INDISTINCT] OF THE CONTRAS, THE DOCUMENT
ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE SUIT NICARAGUA HAS
FILED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,
AND OTHER POINTS.

   I THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE EMERGES FROM THIS SUMMIT. I
AM SURE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS HOPING THAT NOTHING WILL RESULT FROM
THIS SUMMIT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY
EXERTING STRONG PRESSURES SO THAT NOTHING WILL COME FROM THIS SUMMIT.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT: WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES FOR NICARAGUA'S
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SUIT AGAINST HONDURAS?  

   [ORTEGA] THIS HAS TO BE LINKED TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN FOR
THE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL.  

   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTRAS MUST FIRST LEAVE?

   [ORTEGA] OF COURSE.  THAT IS OUR INSURANCE.  

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, HAS HONDURAS AGREED TO THIS?  

   [ORTEGA] WE ARE EXCHANGING VIEWPOINTS ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] THE SUIT REPRESENTS AN INSURANCE FOR YOU,
COMMANDER?  WHICH GROUPS HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PRESSURING?  

   [ORTEGA] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUPS. THERE HAVE BEEN DIRECT AND
INDIRECT CONTACTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTACTED THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN DELEGATIONS IN HOPES THAT NO AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. THE
AMERICANS CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTRAS. THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT BUSH MET WITH CONTRA LEADERS ON THE EVE OF THIS CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THIS MEETING.

   [REPORTER] WHEN YOU MENTION THESE PRESSURES, MR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH
COUNTRIES ARE YOU REFERRING?

   [ORTEGA] ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICARAGUA. I HAVE NO DOUBTS
THAT RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS EXERTING PRESSURE, BECAUSE IT WANTS TO
KILL THIS SUMMIT JUST WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IF NO
AGREEMENT IS REACHED AT THIS SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] BECAUSE WE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE
SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY AND SUFFICIENT SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE TO
DECIDE OUR OWN ACTIONS.

   [REPORTER] AT THIS STAGE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENTS SUMMIT?
IS THIS SUMMIT A FAILURE OR A SUCCESS?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS, EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES HAS
NOT GIVEN UP TRYING TO MAKE IT FAIL. THIS IS THE TIME, AND I AM SURE THAT IT
IS TRYING [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   LIMA, 7 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCES TODAY REPORTED
IN LIMA THAT THREE ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MRTA) HAVE DIED IN A CLASH WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE (PN).  THE GUERRILLAS
WERE TRAVELING IN A STOLEN VEHICLE ON 6 AUGUST, WHEN THEY WERE DETECTED BY A
PN PATROL IN CHICLAYO PROVINCE.  THE PATROL ORDERED THEM TO STOP, BUT THE
GUERRILLAS FLED.  THE POLICE PATROL GAVE CHASE AND CAUGHT THE GUERRILLAS 15
KM FROM CHICLAYO, ON THE ROAD TO CHONGOYAPE.

   A CLASH ENSUED, AND JUAN ZURITA, CESAR ORBEGOZO, AND ERNESTO BENAVIDES
WERE KILLED.  THE INTERIOR MINISTRY BULLETIN REPORTS THAT THE POLICEMEN
SEIZED TWO SUB-MACHINE GUNS, A REVOLVER, AND AN MRTA FLAG FROM THE
GUERRILLAS.

   THE PRO-GUEVARA MRTA STARTED ITS ARMED FIGHT IN 1984, WHEN IT RIDDLED THE
U.S. EMBASSY WITH BULLETS.

   THE MRTA HAS ALSO ATTACKED THE CHINESE, SOVIET, SPANISH, AND ARGENTINE
EMBASSIES.

   IN JANUARY, THE POLICE ARRESTED MRTA'S MAIN LEADER, VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS.
AT LEAST 100 MRTA MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE POLICE THIS YEAR.  

   POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU, WHICH WAS UNLEASHED BY THE MAOIST SHINING
PATH IN 1980, HAS KILLED MORE THAN 15,000 PEOPLE AND CAUSED LOSSES TOTALLING
SOME $12 BILLION -- SOME 60 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PERUVIAN FOREIGN DEBT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I
DO NOT SEEK, NOR WILL I SEEK, THE LAURELS OF VICTORY.  I DO NOT SEEK
HUMILIATING DEFEATS FOR ANYONE.  WHAT I SEEK IS PEACE.  I SEEK
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR HOMELAND.  I SEEK TO SOLVE THE SOCIAL
PROBLEMS OF OUR PEOPLE BY DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL
SALVADORANS.

   TO THE LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, A VITAL COMPONENT OF
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND OUR NATION'S IDEOLOGICAL PLURALISM, WE WISH TO
INVITE YOU TO JOIN US SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN WORK FOR PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR.  LET US SET THE PARTY BANNERS ASIDE AND PICK UP OUR NATIONAL FLAG.

   TO THE FMLN LEADERS, I REITERATE MY DETERMINATION AND POLITICAL RESOLVE
TO WORK FOR PEACE.  I AM TRULY INTERESTED IN PUTTING AN END TO THE BLOODY
FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE.  I HOPE THE FMLN WILL HEAR THE CALL MADE BY THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES AS ESTABLISHED IN THE
ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.  I ALSO HOPE THAT THE FMLN WILL SET ASIDE ITS
INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO CEASE ALL HOSTILITIES AND
THAT IT WILL DEMONSTRATE ITS PEACEFUL INTENTIONS BY STOPPING ALL TERRORIST
ACTIONS AGAINST THE PEOPLE.  I HOPE THE FMLN WILL MEET WITH US TO BEGIN THIS
PROCESS OF PERMANENT AND FIRM DIALOGUE, WHICH WE ARE WILLING TO BEGIN IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS ADOPTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ESQUIPULAS II
AT THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  THIS DIALOGUE SHOULD BE HELD WITHOUT
CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT ANY PROPAGANDA.

   TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE HARD AND
SAD CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR AND WHO ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
PEACE, I ASSURE YOU THAT MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK FOR PEACE BY
SETTING ASIDE ALL POLITICAL, PERSONAL, OR PARTISAN INTERESTS.  I WANT ALL
SALVADORANS TO CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVING A CIVILIZED END TO THE CONFLICT, AND
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL ATTITUDES THAT HINDER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE SET
ASIDE. PEACE MUST NOT BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR AN IDEOLOGICAL OR PARTISAN
STRUGGLE.  LET US SWITCH THE ROLES.  LET US BE THE INSTRUMENTS FOR ACHIEVING
PEACE.  THE SELFISH ATTITUDE THAT HAS HURT THE HOMELAND DEEPLY MUST BE SET
ASIDE, AND WE MUST PLACE THE SACRED INTERESTS OF OUR BELOVED EL SALVADOR
ABOVE ALL ELSE.  

   PEACE CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND
THAT ACHIEVING PEACE WILL BE THE BIGGEST VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE, AND THIS
DOES NOT MEAN IDEOLOGICAL SURRENDER.  WE ALL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF OUR CONSTITUTION.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES US IDEOLOGICAL
PLURALISM AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.

   SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US PRAY THAT GOD WILL OVERSEE THIS EFFORT FOR
PEACE.  MAY THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD GUIDE AND ENLIGHTEN US. THANK YOU AND
MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

30-DAY STATE OF EMERGENCY IN HUAROCHIRI PROVINCE, LIMA DEPARTMENT, DUE TO THE
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THIS PROVINCE.  

   ACCORDING TO THE PERTINENT DECREE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE,
"INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER ARE CARRYING OUT ACTS OF
VIOLENCE IN MINING CENTERS, CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES, BOTH TO

DEPARTMENTS.  

   THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, INVOLVING AT LEAST HALF OF THE 22-MILLION

SUSPENSION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE MILITARY CONTROL OF THE TERRITORY
AFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 AUG 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [REPORT] [ROSSIE
CASTILLO] [TEXT] NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON
SAID TODAY THAT THE POSITION ADOPTED BY EL SALVADOR THROUGH PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AT THE SUMMIT IN TELA, HONDURAS, IS POSITIVE BECAUSE
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  HOWEVER,
HE SAID THAT THE POSITION OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACTUALLY BE VERY CRITICAL NOW.  THE FMLN WILL
NOT LOOK GOOD INTERNATIONALLY IF IT REJECTS THE DIALOGUE.

   HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, IN WHICH HE ALSO REVEALED
THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO MEDIATE THE DIALOGUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ... FALLACIES. THIS IS
NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO WANT SOMETHING AND ENDED UP
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR
INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE [WORD INDISTINCT]
BEFORE THE LITTLE MANGY-DOGS WHO GO ABOUT PLANTING BOMBS HERE.  THEY
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PERHAPS THAT THEY ALWAYS HOLD A HEGEMONIC POSITION
HERE AND WILL TRY TO OBTAIN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION FOR THEIR
ILLEGAL FORCES, WHICH ARE STILL GOING AROUND [WORD INDISTINCT] AND
KILLING PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [CASTILLO] NEVERTHELESS, MAJOR, DO YOU VIEW THIS MEETING AS POSITIVE
[WORD INDISTINCT] WITH THE FMLN -- THAT IS, THE DIALOGUE -- NOW THAT
SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT?  DO YOU THINK PEACE CAN BE
ACHIEVED?

   [D'AUBUISSON] THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SALVADORANS -- AND IN THIS REGARD WE
SPEAK FROM THE HEART -- IS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  IF THE FMLN COOPERATES, WE
WELCOME ITS COOPERATION.  HOWEVER, IF IT DOES NOT COOPERATE, THERE WILL BE
FMLN MEMBERS WHO WILL DEMOBILIZE, THE SAME WAY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] ARE DESERTING.  THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE GIVEN GUARANTEES.  WE
WILL SEE LATER IF, AS THEY SAY, THEY ARE TRULY WORKING, OR STRUGGLING, FOR
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MORE POSITIVE ACTIONS.

   HOWEVER, WE SEE EVERYTHING AS BEING WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING PEACE IN
A SHORT TIME.  [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT IF THE FMLN DOES NOT AGREE TO THE DEMOBILIZATION,
THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IF PEACE IS NOT ACHIEVED.
REGARDING THE COMMISSION, HE SAID IT IS ALREADY BEING ORGANIZED AND WILL
BEGIN A DIALOGUE SOON.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON, IN PROGRESS] ...A CONTINUOUS
DIALOGUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS
INSTRUCTED THAT IT HAVE NO PRIOR AGENDA BUT THAT IT JUST BEGIN.  THEIR
FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE TO TALK, TO NEGOTIATE, TO
ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE.  AND THIS IS TO GO ON CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL SOLUTIONS
ARE FOUND AND THEY ACHIEVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FINAL
SOLUTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] 

   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT ARIAS HAS
OFFERED TO ACT AS MEDIATOR OR INTERMEDIARY.  HE SAID THAT IF THE
COMMISSION GOES TO SAN JOSE, HE WILL TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INVITE
THESE GENTLEMEN TOO AND TO GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED FOR THIS
MEETING TO BEGIN.  AFTER THAT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL DEVELOP THE
MECHANISMS.  [END RECORDING]

   MAJ D'AUBUISSON SAID THE COMMISSION WILL BE SWORN IN AND WILL MAINTAIN AN
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN REPRESENTATIVES.

   COMMENTING ON LEGISLATIVE WORK, HE SAID THAT TODAY THE POLITICAL
COMMITTEE WILL MEET TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION,
WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY NEGLECTED BY DR JAIME VENTURA.  THE ONLY
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION IS DEPUTY
ROBERTO ANGULO, VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE

   BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [EXCERPTS] [PASSAGE OMITTED] SIMON BOLIVAR
AND FRANCISCO DE PAULA SANTANDER GAVE OUR ARMED FORCES THE MISSION OF
DEFENDING FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, AND DEMOCRACY.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
THE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN AN
EASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING.  VERY FEW
NATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT
CHALLENGES.  CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE
THEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF
TRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR,
AND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS.

   AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS
STRENGTHENED.  THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH.  MANY
SOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY
ARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY.  ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF
OF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND
FELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE.  THEIR
EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN.

   THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES.  THE
DETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN.  OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS
NEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF
RECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES.  THIS WAS
THE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.  NOW, WHEN WE ARE
HARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP.  THE PEACE
INITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE
FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION.

   SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT
IDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE.  OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE
ACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  WE DO NOT
AGREE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE
QUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE
ARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL
HANDLING OF VIOLENCE.

   EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A
DEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.
THAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL
EFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION.

   THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A
SUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND.  I AM NOT REFERRING TO
DAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO
SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS.
DEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE.  WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST
PEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED.  THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] 

   I CONGRATULATE THE OFFICERS, CIVILIAN PERSONALITIES, SERGEANT AMAYA
ALVAREZ, AND PRIVATE MALAMBO TIQUE, WHOSE MERITS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY IN
THE NAME OF THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND THE GOVERNMENT.  [APPLAUSE] THIS
CEREMONY, IN WHICH WE HONOR THE HEROES OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ARMY, IS A
SUITABLE OCCASION TO MAKE KNOWN TO OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND
SOLDIERS ALIKE THE NATION'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR COURAGEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL
FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES.  WHEN THE ARMED FORCES ACADEMIES PARADE BEFORE
US, SO WILL THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SERVING
THE HOMELAND AND THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.  EVERY HONEST COLOMBIAN SUPPORTS
THEM.

   SOLDIERS: YOU, WHO WIELD THE NATION'S ARMS, REPRESENT THE BASIC GUARANTEE
THAT PRESERVES SOVEREIGNTY, LIBERTY, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  THANK
YOU.  [APPLAUSE]

50-YEAR-OLD PERUVIANS ARE OF MILITARY AGE, AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO
COMPLY WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW, IN THE RESERVE.

   THEREFORE, ONE NOT ONLY COMPLIES WITH THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN ONE
IS ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS, BUT ONE
CONTINUES COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW BY REMAINING IN THE RESERVE UNTIL 50 YEARS
OF AGE.

   ARTICLE 272 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES:  MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS
OF AGE AND WOMEN BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE NOT ON ACTIVE
MILITARY SERVICE ALL BELONG TO THE RESERVE, AND THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE
OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY CLAUSE 4 OF THIS LAW.

   IF THE LAW STATES THIS, I THEN ASK ALL PERUVIANS: ARE NOT TERRORISTS --
WHO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES RESERVES AND WHO TAKE ARMS TO ATTACK THE
NATIONAL POLICE AND ARMED FORCES -- VIOLATING THE OBLIGATORY MILITARY
SERVICE LAW?  IS NOT HE, WHO BY VIOLENT MEANS TRIES TO DESTROY THE
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF WHICH THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART, VIOLATING THE
MILITARY SERVICE LAW?

   THEREFORE, SINCE ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THOSE WHO
VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW CAN BE TRIED BY THE MILITARY
CODE OF JUSTICE, THEN TERRORISTS CAN BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS.

   THUS THE IDEA IS THAT ONE LAW, ONE ARTICLE, SHOULD ESTABLISH THAT THE
CRIME OF TERRORISM VIOLATES THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW, THEREFORE ENABLING A
QUICK AND DRASTIC PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS.  

   IT WILL THEREFORE NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  A CORRECT
INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALL THAT WILL BE NEEDED.  WE MUST ALSO
REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS APPROVED THERE WAS NO
SERIOUS TERRORIST PROBLEM.  BESIDES, YOU MUST KNOW THAT TO AMMEND THE
CONSTITUTION WE MUST WAIT NEARLY 2 YEARS, AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.

   MANY PERUVIANS THINK THAT IF MILITARY COURTS TRY TERRORISTS THEY WILL BE
SENTENCED TO DEATH.  THIS IS FALSE, IT IS NOT CORRECT.  THE MILITARY COURTS
WILL ONLY RULE SENTENCES IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, BUT THESE SENTENCES WILL
BE APPLIED FIRMLY.  THIS MEANS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED.

   I ASK ALL PERUVIANS AND ALL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL.
TERRORISTS MUST NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT
TRUST THE CIVILIAN COURTS.  THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST SIMPLY INTERPRET THE
CONSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY.  TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS
ARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY.  THE CONSTITUTION
MUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN
FAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.  

   I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION
 TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE
INITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM.

   THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE
ELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL
THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO
LIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY. THANK YOU.

   LA PAZ, 12 AUG 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPT] DEFENSE MINISTER HECTOR
HORMACHEA HAS REVEALED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ASKED TO BE
WITHDRAWN FROM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING BECAUSE THAT
MISSION HAS THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF THE POLICE.

   ORMACHEA EXPLAINED THAT THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN DRUG CONTROL WILL BE
EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY CHIEFS BEFORE A FINAL DECISION IS
MADE.

   ORMACHEA MADE THESE COMMENTS DURING HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE TO TALK
ABOUT THE VARIOUS ISSUES RELATED TO HIS MINISTRY.

   HE ADDED THAT THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE CURRENTLY CARRY OUT A SUPPORT
MISSION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS THE ENTIRE TASK IS
CARRIED OUT BY THE MOBIL UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS (UMOPAR), WHICH ARE UNDER THE
POLICE.

   IN HIS FIRST WEEK AS THE NEW MINISTER, ORMACHEA HELD PRELIMINARY TALKS
WITH SEVERAL MILITARY CHIEFS TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE ARMED FORCES' ROLE IN
CONTROLLING DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   HE SAID: "WE MUST CAREFULLY STUDY AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE
THE ARMED FORCES' DEGREE OF PARTICIPATION IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES WANTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT INITIALLY BEGAN, BUT THEY THEN DECIDED TO
CARRY OUT A SUPPORT MISSION.  HE ADDED: WE ARE GOING TO STUDY THIS AT THE
GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WITH THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE FINAL DECISION ON THE ROLE OF
THE ARMED FORCES.

   ORMACHEA ALSO SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY IS CLOSELY LINKED TO HOW THE
ARMED FORCES ARE EQUIPPED, BUT ALSO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY,
ESPECIALLY IN THE POOREST ZONES AND BORDER AREAS.

   HE SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN TALK LATELY ABOUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES,
ALTHOUGH THE REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN VERY CLEAR.  THERE WERE APPARENTLY
INCURSIONS BY UNIDENTIFIED ARMED GROUPS, MURDER, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT
MAY JEOPARDIZE THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SECURITY.

   ORMACHEA SAID THAT INTERNAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WILL
CONTINUE TO BE THE ARMED FORCES' MAIN CONCERN.

   REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MILITARY ADVISORS INVOLVED IN THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, ORMAECHEA NOTED THAT "THAT WORK WILL BE
USEFUL AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WORK OF BOLIVIAN
ORGANIZATIONS."  

   HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT CHANGING THE PREVIOUS DEFENSE MINISTRY'S
POLICY OF ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRALIZATION OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES IS A POSITIVE
STEP. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

COLOMBIA IS IN UTTER CHAOS TODAY.  THE COUNTRY'S MAGISTRATES RESIGNED
TODAY TO PROTEST THE MURDER OF COLOMBIAN JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA, AND
A FEW MINUTES AGO THE ASONAL [NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE JUDICIAL
BRANCH] JUDGES ALSO TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS.  MEANWHILE, THE
GOVERNMENT IS DESPERATELY ATTEMPTING TO CONVINCE THEM TO GO BACK TO
THEIR JOBS.

   TODAY, THE 54 MAGISTRATES WHO COMPOSE THE CIVIL, LABOR, AND PENAL COURTS
OF THE BOGOTA SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS UNTIL THE
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THEM SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR THEIR LIVES SO THAT
THEY CAN DISPENSE JUSTICE IN COLOMBIA.  

   THE MURDER OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA LED THE COLOMBIAN
MAGISTRATES TO SUSPEND ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  THE MAGISTRATES OF THE BOGOTA
SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL SAID THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT ADDED THAT
THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE THE NEXT VICTIMS EITHER.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED JUDGE] WE FEEL WE ARE WAGING A USELESS
STRUGGLE.  WE ARE FIGHTING FOR IDEALS THAT NOBODY SHARES.  WHAT WE WANT IS
FOR THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN TO SHARE THOSE IDEALS.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE, THE
COLOMBIAN JUDGES, WILL BE WILLING TO GIVE UP OUR LIVES FOR THOSE IDEALS AS
CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA DID. [END RECORDING]

   THE 22,000 JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES JOINED THE MAGISTRATES' PROTEST.
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CALLED FOR AN INDEFINITE
STRIKE, BEGINNING TODAY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISES HAVE
BEEN ONLY THAT, PROMISES.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PLAN TO PROVIDE PROTECTION,
ESCORTS, AND ARMORED VEHICLES HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

   IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT TO END THIS WAVE OF MURDERS THE GOVERNMENT
MUST SHOW THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ERADICATE IT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST
CONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY USING OUR ARMED FORCES WITH DUE RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS.  AS LONG AS THAT IS NOT DONE, NOT ONLY JUDGES, BUT THE BEST CHILDREN
OF COLOMBIA, WILL CONTINUE TO DIE.  [END RECORDING]

ANTIOQUIA POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO WAS
MURDERED THIS MORNING ON THIS CITY'S WEST SIDE.

   THE GUNMEN FIRED ON THE POLICE COMMANDER WHEN HIS VEHICLE STOPPED FOR A
RED LIGHT AT ROAD 80 AND 48TH STREET, NEAR MARTIN RODRIGUEZ VELODROME, A FEW
BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE GOVERNOR OF ANTIOQUIA WAS MURDERED ON 4 JULY.  

   THE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE, WHICH LASTED OVER 3 MINUTES, ALSO SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED ONE OF THE AGENTS ACCOMPANYING COL QUINTERO.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE POLICE CHIEF'S WHITE NISSAN PICKUP, WITH
LICENSE PLATES ME-7847, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ASSASSINS' GRAY MAZDA, LICENSE
PLATES MI-1630.

   A CRIMINAL COURT JUSTICE IDENTIFIED THE BODY OF THE POLICE COMMANDER
MURDERED THIS MORNING IN SALASAN, ON THIS CITY'S WEST SIDE.  THE POLICE
CHIEF WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD SEVERAL TIMES.  

   POLICE UNITS AND SECURITY CORPS AGENTS HAVE REINFORCED STRATEGIC POINTS
IN MEDELLIN AND POLICE CHECKPOINTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE SEARCH FOR
THE CRIMINALS.

   A METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER HAS REPORTED THAT FOR THE PAST WEEK, POLICE
CHIEF QUINTERO HAD BEEN WITHOUT A PERSONAL ESCORT.  THE POLICE CHIEF HAD
EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO RISK OTHER POLICEMEN'S LIVES.  HE
DISMISSED HIS PERSONAL ESCORTS, APPOINTING THEM TO OTHER DUTIES.

   THE POLICE COMMANDER'S ASSASSINATION HAS CREATED A LOT OF COMMOTION IN
COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR ELENA MONTOYA HAS STATED HER CONCERN
OVER THIS NEW EPISODE OF SELECTIVE VIOLENCE AND POINTED OUT THE EFFORTS THAT
THE POLICE COMMANDER HAD BEEN MAKING TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO THE CITIZENS OF
THIS REGION.

   METROPOLITAN POLICE CHIEF ANTONIO SANCHEZ HAS REJECTED THIS NEW ACT OF
VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE AS AN INSTITUTION.  THE MEDELLIN SECURITY
COUNCIL WILL INITIATE A SPECIAL MEETING IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES TO ANALYZE
THE SITUATION.

   COMMANDER QUINTERO FOUGHT DRUG-TRAFFICKING AND SUBVERSION IN ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT.  FROM THE MOMENT HE BECAME ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER, QUINTERO
BECAME KNOWN FOR HIS EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY AND FOR DESIGNING STRATEGIES
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC ORDER.

   ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE PARTICIPATED IN REGIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
MEETINGS WHERE WAYS TO FIGHT CRIME IN ANTIOQUIA WERE DISCUSSED.

   LAST WEDNESDAY HE ACCOMPANIED GOVERNOR MONTOYA TO TOLIMA FOR A SECURITY
MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN THE REGIONS.  AT THAT MEETING, MEASURES
WERE ESTABLISHED TO FIGHT SUBVERSION AND COMMON CRIMINALS.

THAT 800 COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS WERE TAKEN FROM BOGOTA ON BOARD
FOUR PLANES TODAY AND DEPLOYED IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN TO REINFORCE THE
MEDELLIN AUTHORITIES.

   A NATIONAL POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE 800 MEN "ARE PART OF A GROUP
CHOSEN BY THE POLICE AND ARMY TO COUNTERATTACK CRIME IN MEDELLIN."

   THE DEPLOYMENT WAS ORDERED BY THE POLICE AND ARMY HIGH COMMAND AS A
RESULT OF THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA POLICE CHIEF COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN
QUINTERO TODAY IN MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY.  

   ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, QUINTERO WAS FIRED AT "INCESSANTLY" IN A

INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM WHICH VARIOUS UNIDENTIFIED MEN GOT OUT
TO COMMIT THE CRIME.

   COL FRANKLIN QUINTERO, CONSIDERED BY HIS SUPERIORS AS AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY
OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME, WAS KILLED IN THE ACTION.

   THE COLOMBIAN DEPUTY POLICE DIRECTOR, GENERAL CARLOS ARTURO CASADIEGO,
SAID: "IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE MEDELLIN MAFIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE
CRIMES" TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   QUINTERO'S MURDER JOINS THAT OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA. WHO
WAS MURDERED IN BOGOTA ON 16 AUGUST.  AT THE TIME OF HIS MURDER, VALENCIA
WAS INVESTIGATING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S CHIEFS' LINKS.

   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN:
I AM ADDRESSING YOU TO EXPLAIN THE MEASURES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
THE STATE OF SIEGE [MEDIDAS DE ESTADO DE SITIO] WHICH HAVE BEEN
ADOPTED AT A TIME WHEN THE NATION HAS JUSTIFIED REASONS TO FEEL ANGRY
AND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
RECENT DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT.
SENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.  LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT
HE WILL RECOVER FROM HIS WOUNDS.

   THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A
WAVE OF ASSASSINATIONS AND DEATHS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AGAINST
REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY AND FROM ALL
INSTITUTIONS.  HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SEVERAL JUDGES, POLITICAL
LEADERS, SOLDIERS, CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF
THIS BARBARISM.

   VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL.  IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR
AGAINST JUSTICE; IT IS A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY.  THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY MUST RESPOND.  I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS
VALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE
PROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO
WORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER.  THIS
IS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

   TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND
OTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY
FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY.  I
INVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL
THE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE.  ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS
MUST JOIN THE EFFORTS.  NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

   IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL
PARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME.  WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND
SUFFERINGS.  ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID
MANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME,
WILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.  [CONTINUED]

DEV-MUC3-0353 (BBN)

   BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THAT
MEASURE WILL BE COMPLEMENTED WITH A DECREE -- WHICH FALLS UNDER THE
PROVISION OF THE STATE OF SIEGE -- ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO WITH
THE EXCUSE OF CARRYING OUT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OR OTHER ELECTION
ACTIVITIES USE WEAPONS OR THREATEN PEOPLE BY OTHER MEANS TO OBTAIN
SUPPORT OR VOTES FOR A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE OR LIST OF CANDIDATES AND
ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO USING THOSE SAME MEANS PREVENT A CITIZEN
FROM EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO VOTE, WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR 3 TO 6 YEARS
AND WILL HAVE TO PAY A FINE EQUIVALENT TO 10 TO 50 TIMES THE LEGAL
MONTHLY MINIMUM WAGE.

   AS FOR THE MEDIA, WHOSE ROLE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC
ORDER IN THE COUNTRY, I WOULD ONLY STATE THAT THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES
THEM FULL FREEDOM IN TIMES OF PEACE, BUT THEY WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
BEFORE THE LAW WHEN THEY ATTACK PEOPLE'S HONOR, SOCIAL ORDER, OR PUBLIC
TRANQUILLITY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN ENFORCE THOSE LAWS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE CONSTITUTION.

   BASED ON SPECIAL POWERS, TODAY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED OTHER DECREES THAT
THE NATIONAL CONGRESS APPROVED ON A GOVERNMENT REQUEST.  I WILL MENTION ONLY
ONE OF THOSE DECREES.  THIS DECREE AMENDS OUR PENAL CODE.

   THE PUBLIC NAMING OF JURORS WILL BE ELIMINATED.  ORGANIZED CRIME TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THAT JURY APPOINTMENT SYSTEM AND AVOIDED THE ACTION OF JUSTICE
BY INTIMIDATING JURORS.  THE NEW DECREE REDUCES FORMALITIES AND CREATES
ROVING JUDGES WHO WILL HAVE AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THUS
INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  THOSE JUDGES WILL JUDGE
ANY CRIME THAT WILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR REASONS OF PUBLIC ORDER.

   THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED.  THAT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN
THEY CANNOT BE SUPPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.

   WHEN DRAFTING THESE DECREES WE, AS USUAL, PAID DUE ATTENTION TO THE
HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S DECISIONS SO THAT THE CURRENT DECREES
FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE CONSTITUTION.

   THE THREAT THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME REPRESENT JUSTIFIES
THE SEVERITY OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED.  COLOMBIANS CAN BE SURE WE
WILL CONTINUE MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO REGAIN TRANQUILLITY IN
COLOMBIA.  I AM SURE WE WILL OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES.  A HANDFUL OF
CRIMINALS WILL NOT DEFEAT A UNIFIED NATION THAT IS WILLING TO STRUGGLE
AGAINST CRIME.

   WE ARE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING A DIFFICULT TIME.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE
EXPERIENCED EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND COLOMBIA OVERCAME THEM.  WE
MUST NOT STRAY FROM OUR PATH, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE CRIMINALS WANT.  BY
FALLING INTO DESPAIR WE WILL BE PLAYING THE TERRORISTS' GAME.  IF WE
CONTINUE AHEAD FIRMLY AND DECISIVELY, WE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER RESULTS.
INSTEAD OF WASTING OUR TIME IN DISPUTES AND RECIPROCAL REPROACHES, LET US
UNITE OUR ACTIONS AGAINST OUR COMMON ENEMY.  WE MUST WIN THIS WAR.  I AM
SURE WE WILL SUCCEED.  GOOD EVENING AND SEE YOU SOON.

FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF A MAGISTRATE, AND WITHDREW THEIR

   IT IS NOT THE MOMENT TO GO ON STRIKE OR TO RESIGN, JOSE GABRIEL SALOM,
PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OF BOGOTA, STATED.  HE AND 47 COLLEAGUES
HAD PRESENTED THEIR RESIGNATION LAST FRIDAY TO PROTEST THE ASSASSINATION OF
MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, PRESUMABLY BY PAID ASSASSINS OF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  VALENCIA GARCIA HAD REJECTED THE APPEALS TO EXONERATE PABLO

MASTERMINDED THE ASSASSINATION OF JOURNALIST GUILLERMO CANO, DIRECTOR OF THE

NOT DISCLOSE, HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

   [D'AUBUISSON] ALLOW ME TO RESERVE THE IDENTITY OF THE SOURCE, BUT HE DOES
HAVE MUCH CREDIBILITY.  HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT
MOVEMENT, AND HE DOES HAVE CREDIBILITY.  THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS
THE WAY THIS BIG MANGY DOG, THIS MR VILLALOBOS, THINKS.  IF HE WANTS TO COME
HERE AND PARTICIPATE, WE'LL TAKE HIS WORD, AND LET US SEE IF HE WILL REALLY
HAVE A LANDSLIDE VICTORY.

   [REPORTER] WOULD THERE BE ANY GUARANTEES FOR HIS PARTICIPATION?

   [D'AUBUISSON] DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST MANGY DOGS,
UNGO AND ZAMORA, ARE ALREADY HERE?  WE DO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS; THERE
IS A WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS.  NOW, IF THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT, THAT IS A
DIFFERENT STORY.  I AM JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE
HAD, IN ADDITION TO SOME NOTES ON THE ELECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY SOME
WHO CLAIM TO BE COMMANDERS.  THE OVERALL PICTURE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN THE
LAST FEW YEARS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THAT CHANGE, MAJOR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] IN PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE NOTES THEY [THE FMLN
COMMANDERS] HAVE SENT, INCLUDING THE ONES SENT PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS,
THEY SAID THAT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE POSTPONED THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE.
THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY DO HAVE PLANS TO JOIN THE PROCESS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MAJOR?   

   [D'AUBUISSON] IT MEANS TWO BASIC THINGS:  ONE, THEY ARE LOST.  THE OPTION
TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS NO LONGER EXISTS.  

   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE LOST IN THE MILITARY FIELD?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] THEY ARE LOST BOTH IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND IN
THE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  SECOND, THEY NO LONGER
HAVE THE SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW.  THERE
IS NO LONGER ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS TYPE OF REBEL MOVEMENT, FOR THIS TYPE OF
ARMED REBEL MOVEMENT TO SEIZE POWER.

   [REPORTER] YOU MEAN SUPPORT FROM THE USSR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] THERE IS NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNIST WORLD IN
GENERAL.  NATURALLY, THIS IS BASED VERY MUCH ON THE SO-CALLED PERESTROYKA.
THEREFORE, THEY WILL HAVE TO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT.  IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SHOOTING BULLETS
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS MUCH TALK HERE ABOUT FORMING AN INTERNAL OPPOSITION
FRONT; I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE "EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA" CAMPAIGN.  DO
YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS AND THE LINE THIS INTERNAL FRONT MIGHT
FOLLOW?

   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, NOT EXACTLY.  HOWEVER, IT IS LOGICAL THAT AN INTERNAL
POLITICAL FRONT COULD BE FORMED.  THAT WOULD BE A POLITICAL PROCESS WITHIN A
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  IT IS ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT.  THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN
THE WORLD TO DO THAT.

   NOW, THERE ARE SUBVERSIVE THOUGHTS.  WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE BIG MANGY
DOGS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS IN JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  ON
THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTING PUBLIC
ORDER.  IF WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CAUSE HARM AND HINDER THE PROGRAMS PREPARED
BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS CABINET, THEY ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT
ANYHOW.

   REMEMBER THAT VERY SIMPLE PHRASE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING.  THEY
CLAIM THAT IF ARENA FAILS, THEY ARE THE ALTERNATIVE.  THAT IS WHAT THE
GROUP OF UNGO, ZAMORA, AND ALL THOSE REALLY THINKS.  THERE IS ANOTHER
GREAT POSSIBILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN HERE:
ARENA WILL NOT FAIL.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL NOT FAIL.  HOWEVER,
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY ALL THE ILLEGAL, SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN TO
MAKE US FAIL.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
D'AUBUISSON BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [D'AUBUISSON]
ONCE THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE RURAL AREAS,
HARASSMENTS AND ASSASSINATIONS BEGAN SO AS TO GET OUR ATTENTION. THIS
WAS BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS KNOW THAT THE RURAL AREAS HAVE REACTED
FAVORABLY.  THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE GOING
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRARIAN REFORM, WHICH
SHOULD BE PERMANENT.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS CAN BE MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT RESORTING TO
VIOLENCE.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM CAN BE PRODUCTIVE, AND THAT IS OUR
GOAL.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM IN OUR COUNTRY WILL BE MADE PRODUCTIVE.

   [REPORTER] THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PEASANTS WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE SIX
CASES HAD BEEN DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNERS AND THE LANDS WERE LEGALLY
TURNED OVER TO THE OWNERS.

   [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WERE SIX OR MORE CASES.  IF WE LOOK
AT IT FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, SERIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE WHEN THE
LANDS WERE VIOLENTLY OCCUPIED.  MANY LANDS WERE IMPROPERLY OCCUPIED.  WE
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS.  WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS
FOR THESE PEOPLE.  IF THEY CANNOT STAY ON THOSE LANDS, THEY CAN TAKE OTHER
LANDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT 33 LAND TRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY
ABANDONED.  REFUGEES AND ARMY FAMILIES MAY BE BROUGHT TO THOSE REGIONS.
EVEN THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH OUR AGRARIAN REFORM PLAN CAN GO THERE.  NO ONE
WILL BE ABANDONED.

   [REPORTER] WHERE ARE THOSE 33 LAND TRACTS?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] IN GENERAL TERMS, AND TO END THIS INTERVIEW, DO YOU BELIEVE
THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE ONE OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN EL SALVADOR?  

   [D'AUBUISSON] YES, AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL WIN THE ELECTIONS IN THE
FIRST ROUND IN 1994.  IN THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WE WILL ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF
HAVING AN HONEST GOVERNMENT AND OF BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES
DEMOCRATICALLY.  THERE WILL BE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR
WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PROUD OF BEING SALVADORANS.  WE WILL NO LONGER NEED
OTHERS TO DONATE THINGS TO US BECAUSE WE CAN PRODUCE THEM HERE.  WE WILL
CONTINUE WORKING TO RESCUE THIS SHIP SO THAT IT CAN SAIL EFFICIENTLY.

   [REPORTER] MAJOR, WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR VISITING US TODAY AND FOR
DISCUSSING ALL OF THE ISSUES WE COVERED.  IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO LISTEN
TO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND THOSE OF YOUR PARTY REGARDING THE VARIOUS ISSUES.

   [D'AUBUISSON] THANK YOU.  THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW.  I WILL
ALWAYS BE WILLING TO COME BACK HERE AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN.  

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, MAJOR, AND WE THANK ALL OUR VIEWERS.

   BOGOTA, 21 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE ALLEGED
"COMPTROLLER" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
TODAY DURING THE RAID ON A FARM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT WAS
REPORTED IN BOGOTA.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE ARREST OF MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
SINCE THE ARMY AND POLICE LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
MAFIA LAST SATURDAY, OCCURRED ON A FARM NEAR TOLU MUNICIPALITY IN SUCRE
DEPARTMENT.

   ABOUT 24 PEOPLE WERE ALSO ARRESTED ALONG WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
MEMBER.  THE CARTEL IS THE LARGEST WORLD COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION,
WHICH STAGED A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTIONS LAST WEEK.

   IN FACT, MERCENARIES OF THAT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION ASSASSINATED IN LESS
THAN 48 HOURS, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, WAS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS AS PRESIDENT.

   MARTINEZ ROMERO, ONE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS MOST WANTED BY THE U.S. DRUG
ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA), HAD MANAGED TO EVADE A PLAN TO CAPTURE HIM
IN PANAMA CITY LAST 29 MARCH.

   UNOFFICIAL REPORTS IN BOGOTA INDICATE THAT THE WELL-KNOWN MAFIA MEMBER
COULD BE THE FIRST TO BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN KEEPING WITH
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE.  THESE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO
OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE JUSTICE TRIBUNALS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE RELATED TO THE
MAFIA HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE INTENSE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE
COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE, IN THE LARGEST OFFENSIVE EVER LAUNCHED BY
COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS.

   THE ACTIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
ANTIOQUIA, CUNDINAMARCA, AND VALLE DEL CAUCA, WHERE SO-CALLED ELITE PATROLS
HAVE TAKEN OVER EXTENSIVE AND SWANK PROPERTIES OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE "DRUG LORDS" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   REPORTS TODAY INDICATE THAT ONE OF THE PRIVATE HOMES BELONGING TO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "THE MEXICAN," WAS RAIDED IN BOGOTA.

   BUENOS AIRES, 21 AUG 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINA HAS EXPRESSED ITS
SOLIDARITY WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE DURING TODAY'S OAS
SESSION.  THE OAS ALSO EXPRESSED ITS "CONSTERNATION OVER AND REPUDIATION OF"
THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS IN THAT COUNTRY, AND STRESSED THE "INDOMITABLE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND RELATED
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES."

   THE OAS HELD A "SPECIAL AND URGENT" SESSION TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF
COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR LEOPOLDO VILLAR, WHO WANTED TO DIRECTLY INFORM HIS
COLLEAGUES IN THAT ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE VIOLENT EVENTS IN HIS COUNTRY.

   IN HIS SPEECH, THE ARGENTINE DELEGATE REPUDIATE THE CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT
ARE MEANT TO THREATEN MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIA'S JUDICIAL BRANCH, ESPECIALLY
THE MURDERS OF CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO,
AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.

   ACCORDING TO THE TEXT OF THE SPEECH -- RELEASED TONIGHT BY THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY IN BUENOS AIRES -- THE ARGENTINE REPRESENTATIVES CONDEMNED "THOSE
TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT, IN ATTACKING DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE OF LAW, VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE OAS CHARTER AND ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS
OF THE SYSTEM ORGANIZED TO DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN THOSE PRINCIPLES."

   IN EXPRESSING THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA
AGAINST WHAT THEY CALLED "THIS TRAGIC SITUATION," THE ARGENTINE DELEGATES
STATED THAT THE PROBLEM AFFECTING COLOMBIA "IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE
CONTINENT, BECAUSE, AS IT HAS BEEN CORRECTLY STATED, THE WORLD OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING HAS NO BORDERS OR FRONTIERS."

   THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION ALSO STATED THAT THE SOLIDARITY OF THE OAS
MEMBERS MUST BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "A CONDEMNATION OF ALL TYPES OF VIOLENCE
AND OF ALL CRIMINAL TERRORISM."

   IT MUST ALSO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH "THE ACTIONS INTENDED TO VIGOROUSLY
DEFEND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, OF WHICH COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE, THE
ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF MAN, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE CONTINENT."

   THE OAS RESOLUTION ALSO REITERATES THE MEMBER COUNTRIES' CONDEMNATION OF
ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE CONSUMPTION, PRODUCTION, AND TRAFFICKING OF
DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.

   IT ALSO REAFFIRMS THE COMMITMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE RIO DE JANEIRO PROGRAM FOR INTER-AMERICAN ACTION AND THE
GUATEMALA DECLARATION (ALLIANCE OF THE AMERICAS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING).

   THE AMBASSADORS TO THE OAS ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR INTENTION "TO INTENSIFY
THE PREPARATION FOR THE MEETING OF MINISTERS FROM ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES, WITH
THE GOAL OF REEVALUATING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DRUG PROBLEM AND ADOPTING
CONCRETE MEASURES TO ERADICATE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL."

REPORTERS OF THE NEW MAGAZINE POR QUE RESIGNED THEIR POSTS THIS
WEEKEND AFTER RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.  THE FORMER REPORTERS INDICATED
THIS SITUATION COULD MEAN THE MAGAZINE MAY CLOSE THIS WEEK.

   THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE ANONYMOUS THREATS BEGAN ON 18 AUGUST WHEN
THEY WERE ORDERED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN 72 HOURS.  THESE NEWSMEN WERE
FORCED TO RESIGN THEIR JOBS, BUT OTHER REPORTERS, WHO ALSO RECEIVED
THREATENING TELEPHONE CALLS, DID NOT.

   THE FORMER REPORTERS INDICATED THAT THIS IS YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON FREEDOM

DANILO BARILLAS, WHO WROTE COLUMNS FOR THE MAGAZINE, WAS MURDERED.

THREATS. SO, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THIS NEWS MEDIUM WILL DIE A FEW MONTHS
AFTER IT BEGAN.

REINFORCED ITS BORDER CONTROLS ALONG THE LONG AREA IT SHARES WITH COLOMBIA
TO IMPEDE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRYING TO ENTER ECUADOR.  IT ALSO
ANNOUNCED THE EXTENSION OF ITS BINATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO FIGHT THE DRUG
MAFIAS.

   ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO WAS CALLED BY
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS WHERE HE SAID, "WE WILL
TAKE ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS TO STOP THE VIOLENCE FROM SPREADING INTO
ECUADOR."  

   "OUR PUBLIC FORCES ARE ON GUARD" ADDED VALLEJO.  HE DID NOT RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHOSE OPERATION CENTERS ARE
NEAR THE BORDER, COULD TRY TO ENTER ECUADOR TO ESCAPE FROM THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE AFTER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S RECENT MURDERS.  

   VALLEJO, WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE STRONGMAN OF THE ECUADOREAN REGIME,
STATED THAT "ECUADOR IS FOREWARNED OF THE DANGER," BUT HE DID NOT, HOWEVER,
ANTICIPATE WHAT MEASURES WOULD BE TAKEN BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA'S
ADMINISTRATON TO IMPROVE ITS BORDER CONTROLS.

   IN THE PAST YEARS, COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE PURCHASED FARMS IN
ECUADOR TO ESTABLISH THEIR OPERATION CENTERS, AND IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT
ECUADORAN PORTS ARE BEING USED INCREASINGLY TO SHIP DRUGS TO THE UNITED
STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.  THE MINISTER ADDED "WE ARE FIGHTING DRUG
TRAFFICKING VERY STRONGLY."

SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA AND PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ' WARNING THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST
BE STRENGTHENED ARE VENEZUELA'S VISIBLE REACTIONS TO THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF
LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, RECENTLY ARRESTED
IN COLOMBIA AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCES, WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE LAND IN VENEZUELA TO
EXPAND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO PEREZ, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BE MOVED
TO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.  THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE NEED TO
ADOPT STRONG MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY.  "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE
MUST UNITE IN THIS BATTLE," THE HEAD OF STATE SAID.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT
VENEZUELA WILL SUPPORT COLOMBIA BY STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER.

   IN THIS SENSE, VENEZUELAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL FILMO LOPEZ UZCATEGUI
ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF "TASK FORCES" THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED ALONG
VENEZUELA'S WESTERN BORDER.  THESE TASK FORCES WILL CARRY OUT INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY UNITS STATIONED IN THE AREA.

   THE MINISTER REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PARAMILITARY PERSONNEL BEING
RECRUITED TO FORM THE "TASK FORCES" AND ADDED THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE
THAT OCCURRED IN EL AMPARO ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA LAST YEAR WHEN A
GROUP OF SOLDIERS MURDERED 17 FISHERMEN WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

   "WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TO
CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, THE MINISTER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCES STATIONED ALONG THE COLOMBIAN -
VENEZUELAN BORDER, AND CARRIED IN TODAY'S EDITION OF EL NACIONAL, MEDELLIN
CARTEL TREASURER MARTINEZ ROMERO WANTED TO BUY LAND IN ZULIA AND TACHIRA,
TWO VENEZUELAN STATES, TO EXPAND THE ORGANIZATION'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

   ACCORDING TO ZULIA STATE GOVERNOR ISMAEL ORDAZ, THE SECURITY CORPS HAVE
BEEN ALERTED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING "CAPOS"
MAY HAVE FLED INTO VENEZUELA AS A RESULT OF THE PERSECUTION UNLEASHED IN
COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.

   BOGOTA, 23 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] THE
GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS CONTINUES.  THE
OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN MEDELLIN HAVE RESULTED IN
70 RAIDS.  HOUSES, FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, AND APARTMENTS REPORTEDLY
OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE AUTHORITIES;
921 PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 2 OF WHOM FACE CHARGES THAT MERIT
THEIR EXTRADITION.

   THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN
ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  HOURS AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER DRUG TRAFFICKERS, REGIONAL AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED A
LARGE-SCALE PLAN TO CARRY OUT RAIDS AND CONFISCATIONS, AND TO SET UP ROAD
BLOCKS.

   TWENTY-TWO PROPERTIES -- INCLUDING FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, BUILDINGS, AND
RESTAURANTS -- WERE SEIZED UNDER THE CHARGES THAT THEY WERE OWNED BY MEMBERS
OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THE MOST OUTSTANDING CASES INCLUDE THE MONACO
BUILDING -- WHICH WAS ALMOST DESTROYED DURING A DYNAMITE ATTACK LAST YEAR,
WAS BEING REPAIRED, AND HAD PRACTICALLY BEEN RESTORED TO ITS FORMER SPLENDOR
-- GAMA BUILDING, INTERNATIONAL DISCOTHEQUE, CAMA SUELTA DISCOTHEQUE
FORTALEZA DEL LAURO DISCOTHEQUE, AND DON MATEO DISCOTHEQUE, UNDOUBTEDLY THE
MOST LUXURIOUS IN THE CITY.

   SEVERAL FARMS WERE ALSO SEIZED, INCLUDING EL BIZCOCHO FARM, WHERE SEVERAL
WEAPONS CACHES WERE FOUND, AND LAS AGUILAS FARM, BECAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS
FURNITURE AND APPLIANCES SURPASS 3 BILLION PESOS.  THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC
IN ALL THE CONFISCATED PROPERTIES IS THEIR LUXURY AND ECCENTRICISM, THUS
MAKING THEIR TOTAL VALUE INCALCULABLE.

   THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED WEAPONS, VEHICLES, AND COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT.  THE FIRST REPORT INDICATES 921 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BUT THE
FIGURE COULD BE HIGHER, GIVEN THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN RECENT HOURS.
THE ARRESTED PERSONS INCLUDE TWO WHO REPORTEDLY FACE ENOUGH CHARGES TO
GUARANTEE THEIR EXTRADITION.

   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH
INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS.  SHE IS ANA ELENA BEATRIZ
RODRIGUEZ, WHO IS THE THIRD EXTRADITABLE PERSON SOUGHT BY U.S.  AUTHORITIES
IN CONNECTION WITH MONEY LAUNDERING.  SHE WAS CAPTURED IN CARTAGENA.

   THE COLOMBIAN ARMY'S RAIDS ON PROPERTIES REPORTEDLY OWNED BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS STILL CONTINUE.  TWO NEW FARMS LOCATED WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE
IN PALMIRA MUNICIPALITY JURISDICTION WERE RECENTLY SEIZED BY THE ARMED
FORCES.  LA RUIZA FARM, A SYNONYM FOR OSTENTATION AND LUXURY, IS A
RECREATION CENTER OWNED, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, BY RAMIRO CORREA.
PEOPLE VISITING THE FARM COULD ENJOY THE POOLS, SURROUNDED BY LUXURY RUGS,
JACUZZIS, A TENNIS COURT, BARS, EXOTICALLY DECORATED BEDROOMS, AND A
FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM.

   THE AUTHORITIES SEIZED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, COMMUNICATION
EQUIPMENT, BULLET-PROOF VESTS, AMMUNITION FOR RIFLES, GRENADES BROUGHT FROM
ISRAEL, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND INFRA-RED SIGHTS -- WHICH NOT EVEN THE ARMY
HAS -- AT EL ROSAL FARM, LOCATED
 IN THE AREA OF POTRERILLOS.  THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED MOTORCYCLES
SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY.  MOST OF THE VALLEY WAS VISIBLE FROM A LOOKOUT
TOWER, PROBABLY FOR SECURITY REASONS OR FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.  THE
MAIN ATTRACTION AT THE FARM WERE TRAINED HIGH- STEPPING COLOMBIAN HORSES.
THE OWNERS OF THESE FARMS HAVE YET TO BE ARRESTED, AND THERE IS STILL NO
INFORMATION ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS.  THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES IS
CALCULATED IN MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS.

   THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL BLOWS TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN
ATLANTICO DEPARTMENT.  BERNARDO LONDONO QUINTERO, A NATIVE OF PEREIRA AND
ACCUSED OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED EARLY THIS
MORNING NORTH OF BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING
LONDONO'S ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE IS APPARENTLY SOUGHT BY THE U.S.
AUTHORITIES.  FURTHERMORE, THE BARRANQUILLA AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED
ALBERTO ORLANDES GAMBOA, A 34-YEAR-OLD NATIVE OF BARRANQUILLA WHO IS
CONSIDERED ANOTHER EXTRADITABLE PERSON. THE AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED HIS
WINE-COLORED TOYOTA LAND CUISER AND A BROWNING 9-MM PISTOL.S EVERAL RAIDS ARE
CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN NORTHERN BARRANQUILLA AT RESIDENCES PRESUMABLY OWNED
BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   GAVIRIA EXPERIENCED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS OF HIS POLITICAL
CAREER WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED CANDIDATE OF THE NEW LIBERALISM MOVEMENT.  IT
IS ALSO PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE BECAUSE
HE RECEIVED THE BANNERS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO WAS KILLED LAST FRIDAY.

SPECIAL A RESOLUTION TO ALLOW THE REGISTRATION OF THE NEW CANDIDACY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GAVIRIA] IF YOU ALL SUPPORT ME IN THIS EFFORT, IN THE
MIDST OF THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS IN OUR

HEADQUARTERS OF THE NEW LIBERALISM PARTY, WHOSE LEADER IS THE RECENTLY
MURDERED SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.

   A SECOND BOMB EXPLODED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY, ALSO LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN MEDELLIN, CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE.

   THE POLICE SAID THAT THE COUNTRY HOMES OF LEADER IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR

MUNICIPALITIES, RESPECTIVELY, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, WERE SIMILARLY ATTACKED
BY THE TERRORISTS.  

   IN ITS INITIAL REPORT THE POLICE ADMITTED THAT THE WAVE OF BOMBINGS COULD
BE LINKED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S WEEK-LONG NATIONWIDE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE
DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 24 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] WELL-KNOWN BANKER RAMIRO
CASTILLO LOVE WAS MURDERED TODAY BY A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS WHO
RIDDLED HIM WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AS HE WAS LEAVING HIS RESIDENCE IN AN
ELEGANT SUBURB IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THIS CITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, APPROXIMATELY SIX UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS BEARING
ARMS WENT TO HIS RESIDENCE THIS MORNING WITH THE INTENTION OF ROBBING OR
KIDNAPPING CASTILLO.  CASTILLO RESISTED, HOWEVER, AND WAS SHOT TO DEATH.
THE ATTACKERS ALSO WOUNDED CASTILLO'S SON.  

   AFTER MURDERING CASTILLO THE ATTACKERS JUMPED INTO ONE OF CASTILLO'S

   BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AS A
RESULT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER,
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' SECURITY IN PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAS BECOME A
MAJOR ISSUE.

   FOLLOWING ARE THE MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES WHEN
ENDANGERED.

   FROM NOW ON SUPPORTERS OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES DURING THEIR
CANDIDATES' PUBLIC APPEARANCES.

   MEASURES FOR CANDIDATES 

   1. ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF
THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT.  THE
CHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL
PROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.

   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY
THREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS
ESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.

   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS
ILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE
NAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.

   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS
ESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.

   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE
LAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE
ROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.

   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  

   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE
TO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR
CANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.

   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING
DEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.

   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE
CANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW
SUCH THINGS.

   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE
THEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS
AT UNUSUAL HOURS.

   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES
HAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.  THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST
UNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION.  CANDIDATES ARE MEN UNDER THE
DICTATORSHIP OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR SAFETY IN TIMES
OF RAGE.

   NO CITY (ISRAEL), 25 AUG 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH NETANYAHU BY
FRIEDMAN AND DAN] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [FRIEDMAN] YOU MUST KNOW BETTER
THAN I THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL
ISRAELI NATIONALS, ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING SECURITY-RELATED DEALS WITH
VARIOUS REGIMES WHICH -- TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD, AT LEAST --
APPEAR TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE.  WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT GUIDE
ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AS A STATE AND WHEN ISSUING PERMITS TO PRIVATE
COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALS WITH SUCH COUNTRIES?

   [NETANYAHU] I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS CRITERIA
DETERMINED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH ARE OFTEN RELATED TO OUR OWN
DEFENSE ISSUES.  ONE CRITERION, HOWEVER, IS CLEAR:  WE DO NOT ALLOW
COOPERATION WITH ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT STATE-AFFILIATED, SUCH AS CARTELS,
GROUPS, OR GANGS.  ALL THESE ARE OFF LIMITS.  THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT, AND NO GREY AREAS.  THEREFORE, IF THE REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA ARE TRUE,
THE PEOPLE ACTED COUNTER TO OUR POLICY AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

   [FRIEDMAN] WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS TO CERTAIN
REGIMES?

   [NETANYAHU] I REPEAT:  STATE MOVEMENTS ONLY, OR, LET US SAY, STATE
REGIMES.  THIS IS OUR POLICY.  ANY OTHER ACTION RUNS COUNTER TO OUR POLICY.

   [DAN] WHEN ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA IS
MENTIONED, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS REFERRED TO?  PERHAPS THE
STATEMENT IS EXAGGERATED, AND THERE ARE NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS
THREE ISRAELIS?

   [NETANYAHU] THAT IS A GOOD POINT; REPORTS ARE SO OFTEN BLOWN OUT OF
PROPORTION.  WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REPUTATION WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO
EXAGGERATED AND FANTASTIC -- I DO NOT WISH TO USE THE TERM ROMANTIC --
REPORTS IN THIS CONTEXT.  IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY REPORTS, AND WE WOULD
LIKE TO GET TO THE CORE OF TRUTH BEHIND THEM.  AFTER THAT, WE WILL DECIDE
WHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE.  WE MAY TAKE LEGAL STEPS, TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S
PASSPORTS, AND RESORT TO OTHER METHODS.

   [FRIEDMAN] IN THE PAST, MR NETANYAHU, YOU BELONGED TO AN ARMY UNIT IN
WHICH OUR FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED.  HAVE YOU FOUND FORMER ARMY FRIENDS IN
ANY OF THE MENTIONED NAMES?

   [NETANYAHU] NO, AND I HOPE NEVER TO FIND ANY.  

   [DAN] DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON?  

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS! 

   [FRIEDMAN] YES, IF IT EXISTS.  OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS
SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOLID GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION.

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS, I THINK IT REFLECTS THE MORAL CORRUPTION OF A
FEW INDIVIDUALS.  THE STATE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT EACH OF ITS
NATIONALS DOES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO
MERCENARY OR OTHER TEMPTATIONS.  THE EXPRESSION OF SELLING ONE'S SOUL TO THE
DEVIL IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR CASE.

   [FRIEDMAN] DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.  

   [NETANYAHU] THANK YOU.

   BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SINISTER EXTRADITABLES GROUP TODAY
THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY COLOMBIAN WHO IS EXTRADITED TO THE
UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO WHO HAS ANNOUNCED THAT INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN BE
EXTRADITED.

   THE CLANDESTINE GROUP, WHICH EARLY THIS MORNING SET FIRE TO THE LLANO
GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB IN RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, 40 KM NORTH OF MEDELLIN, SENT
A LETTER TODAY TO OMAR GARCES, FIRST SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE OF CALI, INFORMING
HIM OF THE THREAT TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EVERY PERSON EXTRADITED.

   GARCES, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL OFFICIALS IN
VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES SENT SEVERAL
MESSAGES WITH THE THREAT TO VARIOUS JUDICIAL OFFICES IN THAT AREA OF THE
COUNTRY, LOCATED 500 KM FROM BOGOTA.

   AS A RESULT OF THE EXTRADITABLES' THREAT, THE JUDGES ARE HOLDING A
MEETING TO WEIGH THE SITUATION AND DETERMINE THE VERACITY OF THE WARNING.
HOWEVER, THEY DECIDED THEY WILL NOT STOP WORKING.

   "THE TIME HAS COME TO UNITE AROUND THE COUNTRY'S FLAG TO RECOVER
COLOMBIA'S DIGNITY AND TO PREVENT ITS BAD SONS FROM CONTINUING TO SHAME IT
BEFORE THE WORLD," JUDGE GARCES SAID.  HE ALSO ASKED FOR PROTECTION FOR
HIMSELF AND THE OTHER JUDGES IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY.

   SANTIAGO, 25 AUG 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] LA SERENA
INVESTIGATIVE POLICE HAVE DEALT A HARD BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BY
ARRESTING FOUR PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ENTERED CHILE ACROSS THE NORTHERN
BORDER WITH 2 KG OF COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE VALUED AT $160,000.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ROSA DEL CARMEN ZABALA, 35,
RESIDING IN MIRAFLORES NEIGHBORHOOD IN LIMA, PERU; ROSENDA LUCRECIA RIBANE,
34, ALSO RESIDING IN MIRAFLORES, LIMA; CHAUFFER OSCAR AUGUSTO PORTOCARRERO,
25, RESIDING IN PUNTA NEGRA, LIMA; AND RUBEN URIEL GARCIA, 36, RESIDING IN
LIMA, PERU.  

   THOSE PEOPLE WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE LA SERENA JUDGE ON DUTY,
AND THE COCAINE WAS INCINARATED AT THE LA SERENA REGIONAL HOSPITAL.

   THE FOUR TRAFFICKERS CARRIED THE COCAINE IN SEALED PACKAGES READY FOR
SALE IN LA SERENA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE PACKAGES WERE HELD IN
ELASTIC CORSETS UNDER THEIR CLOTHS.  THE CORSETS HAD BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH
PEPPER TO DISGUISE THE COCAINE'S CHARACTERISTIC SMELL.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH CRISTIANI
BY KOBERG] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] WHEN MUCH TERRORIST VIOLENCE
IS CREATED AND WHEN MUCH STREET VIOLENCE IS CREATED, EVERYONE IS
ADVERSELY AFFECTED; WE BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT PREVENTS
VIOLENCE, IT IS DOING A MORE PROFESSIONAL JOB THAN IF IT ALLOWED IT TO
TAKE PLACE, BECAUSE ONCE THE VIOLENCE GETS STARTED, THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR ACTIONS MAY BE A LOT MORE UNFORTUNATE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE
POLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS.

   OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE
FMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS
GATHERED.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  UNFORTUNATELY MANY
OF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED.  MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE
INNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE
TO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE
ACTING WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

   THERE ARE CASES SUCH AS MR MASARIEGO.  WHEN HE WAS RELEASED, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM, AND WE HAVE HERE
DOCUMENTS PROVING THAT.  HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF
HIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  IT
HAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS
RELEASED.  THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ABROAD.  HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

   [KOBERG] MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE
HIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS.  HE WAS NOT
VERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME
OBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE.  ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  HE SAID
THAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE
GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.  WE HAVE
LEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP
IMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS
CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS
FRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT
UNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION?  COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE
ECONOMIC POLICY?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER
HAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY.  THIS WORD HAS BEEN
MANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT
WHAT THE FMLN WANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING
MEANS.  I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING.  A NEGOTIATION
IS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE
HAVE BEEN PROPOSING.  WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
POINTS POSSIBLE.  LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER
SIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL
NEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE
COUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE.  THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING
THEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC.  IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR
PROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS.

   IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY
PLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT
TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM.

   WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING.  THE FMLN REFUSES
TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING
CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY
BEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED.  THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.
THEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO.  LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE
VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED.  HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY
THIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW.  THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO
RESOLVE.  THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.  IT IS
NECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS,
NOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON.  WE SHOULD BEGIN BY
TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  IF THEY FIND
THEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
ALSO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STANCE.  THE FMLN KEEPS SAYING THAT THERE ARE
NO PROPER CONDITIONS FOR TALKING.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] LAST
MINUTE REPORT: IN CONFUSING EVENTS, POLICE LIEUTENANT ALFREDO CORREA
AND ONE PRIVATE WERE KILLED IN VALLE DEPARTMENT.  NO FURTHER
INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE, OTHER THAN THAT
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE EVENT.

   IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 10TH ARMY BRIGADE MEMBERS FOUND AND
CONFISCATED 2 METRIC TONS OF HIGH-GRADE COCAINE AT LA MONEDA FARM IN LECHI,
CAUCASIA, AT THE BORDER BETWEEN ANTIOQUIA AND CORDOBA DEPARTMENTS.  THE DRUG
WAS FOUND IN SEALED WATERPROOF PACKAGES IN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THIS MAKES
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE DRUG WAS READY TO BE AIR DROPPED OVER THE SEA TO BE
PICKED UP BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IN ADDITION, A LARGE NUMBER OF ARMS, A
SIZABLE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION, AS WELL AS AUTOMOBILES AND RADIO SETS WERE
CONFISCATED.  THE DRUG WAS SET ON FIRE IN THE PRESENCE OF JUDGES AND
MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  A CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIP WAS ALSO DESTROYED.

   ARSON SEEMS TO BE THE NEW CRIMINAL STYLE USED IN ANTIOQUIA.  IN LESS THAN
24 HOURS, FOUR FARMS HAVE BEEN SET ON FIRE.  THREE OF THESE FARMS, LOCATED
NEAR MEDELLIN, ARE OWNED BY POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL LEADERS EDGAR GUTIERREZ
CASTRO, IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR, AND AUGUSTO LOPEZ.  THE MOST RECENT OF THESE
INCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THE LLANO GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB EARLY THIS MORNING.
SEVERAL ARMED MEN SHOWED UP AT THE SITE AND SET THE CLUB ON FIRE AFTER
THREATENING AND BEATING UP THE WATCHMEN.  THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT
YET BEEN DETERMINED.  THE MANAGER DID NOT ALLOW REPORTERS INTO THE PLACE.  IT
WAS REPORTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE ATTACKERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS
EXTRADITABLES WHO SAID THE ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN IN REPRISAL FOR THE
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THEM.  THE ARMED MEN LEFT THE PLACE SHOUTING THAT
THEIR REACTION HAS JUST BEGUN AND THAT THEIR STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE.
FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CLUB AND THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE WERE PREVENTED BY
WORKERS WHO REACTED PROMPTLY.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THESE ACTIONS.
THE ARMY THIS AFTERNOON WILL RECEIVE THE INITIAL U.S.  TACTICAL SUPPORT AS
PART OF THE NEW ANTITERRORIST OFFENSIVE, GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE REPORTED.
U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES WILL FLY TO COLOMBIA ARMED TWIN-TURBINE BELL-212
HELICOPTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE PENTAGON WILL SHIP RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT.  THE HELICOPTERS WILL BE FLOWN BY COLOMBIAN MILITARY CREWS, U.S.
STATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES SAID IN WASHINGTON.  FOR THE TIME BEING, BOTH
GEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION AND VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ARE NOT
CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MILITARY MEN IN COLOMBIA.  

   OVER THE PAST 72 HOURS, THE ARMY RAIDED FIVE FARMS, ONE HOME, AND A
BAR-RESTAURANT OWNED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, CAMILO ZAPATA, AND PABLO
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA.  THE RAIDS WERE CONDUCTED BY 13TH BRIGADE TROOPS IN CHIA,
PACHO, AND BOGOTA.  THIS FARM, KNOWN AS EL CASTILLO DE MARROQUIN, OWNED BY
ZAPATA AND ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS, WAS RAIDED ON
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, THIS VERITABLE FORTRESS,
LOCATED ON THE EL COMUN BRIDGE, WAS MANAGED BY RETIRED POLICE MAJOR ALVARO
TOVAR TOVAR.  LUXURIOUS CARS, A GOLD-ORNAMENTED CHAPEL, A SWIMMING POOL
FITTED WITH A HEATING SYSTEM, 15 STABLES WITH FINE HORSES, A TENNIS COURT,
AND THE IMPRESSIVE CASTLE ALL MAKE UP A FARM WORTH MILLIONS.  EXTENSIVE
GARDENS, LONG TRAILS, AND AN ATTRACTIVE LAKE COMPLEMENT THE WONDERFUL NATURAL
LANDSCAPE OF THE REAL ESTATE RIGHT BY THE BOGOTA NORTHERN FREEWAY.  THERE
ARE EXOTIC ADORNMENTS ON THE WALLS.  FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A BOTERO
PAINTING WORTH 4 MILLION PESOS.  IN ONE ROOM, THERE WERE MANY ELECTRIC
APPLIANCES AND A FULL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SET.  THE EXORBITANT WEALTH IS
INDICATED BY EVEN A WITCHCRAFT ROOM.  [CONTINUED]

   BRIDGETOWN (BARBADOS), 24 AUG 89 (CANA) -- [TEXT] WASHINGTON,
D.C.--THE BAHAMAS GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING COLOMBIA'S FIGHT ON ILLEGAL
DRUG TRAFFICKING. "THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT
EVENTS IN COLOMBIA. WE APPLAUD THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT FOR THE BOLD
STEPS HE IS TAKING, BUT WE MUST SHOW THE CARTELS THAT HE IS NOT
ALONE," BAHAMAS' FOREIGN MINISTER CHARLES CARTER SAID.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS
FOLLOWING THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. CARTER SAID THAT "ALL OF
US IN THIS HEMISPHERE" MUST SHOW THE DRUG DEALERS THEY ARE "PART OF THE WAR".

   THE BAHAMAS WANTS TO HOST A MEETING THIS YEAR OF LEADERS OF THE
HEMISPHERE TO DEFINE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WAGING AN ALL OUT WAR ON
THE PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.
CARTER TOLD CANA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR A
WELL PLANNED, COORDINATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TACKLE ALL
ASPECTS OF THE DRUG PROBLEM. HE SAID HIS COUNTRY HOPED SUCH A SUMMIT COULD
BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD CANA THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD INDICATED TO THE
UNITED STATES IN JANUARY A WILLINGNESS TO HOST THE SUMMIT BUT, TO DATE,
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION.  "WE DISCUSSED
THE IDEA OF THE SUMMIT AT THE CARICOM (CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY) FOREIGN
MINISTERS MEETING, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, AT THE ORGANIZATION OF
AMERICAN STATES (OAS) AND WE INFORMED THE UNITED STATES BY DIPLOMATIC NOTE
IN JANUARY OF OUR DESIRE TO HOST THE MEETING BUT SO FAR THE UNITED STATES
HAS NOT RESPONDED. WHETHER WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GO AHEAD WITH IT I'M NOT
SURE," CARTER EXPLAINED.

   CARTER WAS AGAINST USING UNITED STATES TROOPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE
CARIBBEAN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS, POINT OUT THAT "THE DEMOCRATIC
TRADITIONS IN SOME OF OUR COUNTRIES WOULD BE THREATENED IF WE WERE TO RESORT
TO THE USE OF FORCE." HE SAID ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS ONE BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY
AND THE UNITED STATES FOR JOINT POLICING COULD EXTENDED TO INVOLVE OTHER
COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED ARE
CONSUMED IN NORTH AMERICA. "WE ARE NOT THE MARKETS.  COUNTRIES LIKE THE
BAHAMAS, JAMAICA, TRINIDAD, CUBA AND BARBADOS ARE ONLY USED BY THE DRUG
LORDS TO REACH THE 3 BILLION DOLLAR UNITED STATES MARKET," HE REMARKED. "WE
AREN'T REALLY THE TARGET AND THEREFORE WE MUST FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF
DEMAND. AND WE IN CARICOM, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAHAMAS, ARE READY TO BE
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE UNITED STATES DRUG PROBLEM."

   CARTER SAID AMONG THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A SUMMIT WOULD BE "A JUDICIAL
ATMOSPHERE" THAT WOULD LET THE DRUG BARONS, DEALERS AND USERS "KNOW THAT
THEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY ARE OR WHEREVER THEY GO."

   DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY.
BANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND
BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF
140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS
WERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE
UNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, FOR
SOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS,
CONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS
CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY
GROUPS.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR,
LAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL.  HIS
REMAINS [29-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING.  THEY ALSO BRING TO
THE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE
COUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION.

   MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED,
CONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN
THAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.  LOOKING AHEAD,
THE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS
HAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER.  THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY
ARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS,
LABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS.  PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT
HAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA.  LUIS
CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION.  PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT
MAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE
INDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 25 AUG 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE KIDNAPPING OF FIVE
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE MURDER OF A PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN IN
GUATEMALA CITY THIS WEEK SHOOK THE COUNTRY AND UNLEASHED A WAVE OF
CRITICISM AGAINST THE VINICIO CEREZO ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF WHAT
CRITICS CALLED "ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS."

   SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES TODAY WERE: "RAMIRO CASTILLO'S MURDER
CONDEMNED," "CRIME AGAINST BUSINESSMAN CAUSES GENERAL INDIGNATION,"
"DEPUTIES ASK FOR END TO VIOLENCE," "THE BLOODBATH MUST STOP," AND "CALL FOR
GOVERNMENT MINISTER'S RESIGNATION."

   THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO DISAPPEARED THIS WEEK ARE VICTOR HUGO
RODRIGUEZ JARAMILLO, HIS WIFE, SILVIA MARIA AZURDIA UTRERA, IVAN ERNESTO
GONZALEZ FUENTES, CARLOS CONDE, AND HUGO GRAMAJO.

   THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, WHICH EMERGED FROM
THE ESQUIPULAS PEACE AGREEMENT, EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN TODAY OVER THE LATEST
VIOLENCE WHICH, IT SAID, IS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
COUNTRY.

   THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT THE LIVES OF THE KIDNAP VICTIMS BE RESPECTED AND
IT ADDED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE "ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN THE
CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR."

   RAMIRO CASTILLO, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL AND ONE OF THE
MOST PROMINENT GUATEMALAN BUSINESSMEN, WAS SHOT TO DEATH ON 24 AUGUST BY A
GROUP OF ARMED MEN WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE IN SANTA CATARIAN PINULA, 30 KM
SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE AUTHORITIES SAID HE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO PREVENT A THEFT FROM
OCCURRING IN HIS HOUSE BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE FAMILY RULED OUT THAT
POSSIBILITY.

   ONE OF CASTILLO'S CHILDREN, 23-YEAR-OLD RAMIRO, WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE
INCIDENT.

   CASTILLO'S MURDER CAUSED ANGER, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
SECTOR.

   THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND
FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS (CACIF), WHICH HOUSES THE PRIVATE SECTOR
ORGANIZATIONS, BLAMED THE CEREZO ADMINISTRATION AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY
FORCES "FOR THEIR INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS, AND IT ASKED
FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE BALDIZAN'S RESIGNATION BECAUSE "HE HAS
OBVIOUSLY BEEN INCOMPETENT IN DOING HIS JOB."

   CLANDESTINE, 27 AUG 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] 1.
ON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE [SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN]
CATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE
ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL
LAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE
AND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL [OMAR NAPOLEON] AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN
PANAMA [IN 1987].

   2.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND
CONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
AND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS
ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY
AND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND
ENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS
GIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT
HINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.

   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,
CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY
HAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT
RESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'
DISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR
ACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND
DEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.

   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF
NEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE
ARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO
CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF
THE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT
BE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.

   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO
STAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY
WILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL
LEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
ACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.  [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 26
AUGUST 1989.

METROPOLITAN POLICE THIS MORNING DEFUSED FIVE BOMBS AND ARRESTED FIVE
SUSPECTS.  DURING THE OPERATION, THE POLICE RECOVERED SEWING MACHINES
[MAQUINAS DE CORSAR] WORTH 25 MILLION PESOS.  A VEHICLE AND A
MOTORCYCLE WERE CONFISCATED.

   FOUR POLICE AGENTS FROM THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BOYACA COMMAND KIDNAPPED
BY THE SO-CALLED ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION [ELN] WERE RELEASED ON 27
AUGUST AT 1800 IN GRENADA, EASTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  THE POLICE AGENTS

PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONAL POLICE ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS WHEN THEY WERE
KIDNAPPED ON THE MEDELLIN-BOGOTA HIGHWAY.

   THE RELEASED POLICEMEN HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO THEIR SUPERIORS YET AND
THEREFORE COULD NOT TALK TO THE MEDIA.  THE ELN REPORTED THAT IT TREATED THE
POLICEMEN WELL AND THAT THIS RELEASE IS AN ACTION IN FAVOR OF A MORE
HUMANIZED WAR, WHICH IS A SLOGAN THESE GUERRILLAS HAVE PROCLAIMED IN THE
PAST 5 YEARS.  SHORTLY BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THESE POLICEMEN, THE ELN

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE FORCES HAVE
RAIDED AN OFFICE IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA THAT APPARENTLY SERVED AS THE "FINANCIAL
HEADQUARTERS" OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP HEADED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS
MADE TODAY BY THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE NUMBERS OF THE
BANK ACCOUNTS THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAS IN COLOMBIA AND ABROAD.  THE
AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED 30 SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS, TELEFAX, AND OTHER
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER SEVERE SETBACK FOR RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, ONE OF THE MAFIA BOSSES MOST WANTED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS THE MEXICAN, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RIGHT-HAND
MAN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S TOP BOSS.  GACHA'S GROUP
HAS SUFFERED MANY LOSSES DUE TO THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT
AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS, ELITE ARMY TROOPS HAVE SEIZED SEVERAL LARGE FARMS OWNED BY
RODRIGUEZ GACHA IN THE TOWN OF PACHO, AS WELL AS LUXURIOUS RESIDENCES IN
BOGOTA. A SON OF RODRIGUEZ GACHA, FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, AND THE GROUP'S
"CHIEF OF FINANCES," FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO--WHO IS WANTED BY THE U.S.
AUTHORITIES--ARE BEING HELD BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.  

   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE "WAR" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ON THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS, A SUPERIOR COURT HAS REVOKED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND OTHER PERSONS LINKED TO MASSACRES
CARRIED OUT BY RIGHTIST MILITARY GROUPS BEING TRAINED BY ISRAELI, BRITISH,
U.S., AND WEST GERMAN MERCENARIES, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE RULING WAS MADE KNOWN YESTERDAY. TODAY THE COUNTRY IS STILL AMAZED,
CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE MAFIA LEADERS
MASTERMINDED THE MASSACRES, AS REPORTED BY JUSTICE MARIA ELENA DIAZ, WHO WAS
SHOT TO DEATH LAST MONTH, EVIDENTLY AS A REPRISAL FOR HAVING STATED THIS
OPINION.

   THE ARREST WARRANT ALSO INCLUDED LUIS RUBIO ROJAS, A FORMER MAYOR OF THE
TOWN OF PUERTO BOYACA, AN OPERATIONS CENTER OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY
ELEMENTS, AND SEVERAL ARMY DETACHMENT ELEMENTS WHO REPORTEDLY PROMOTE
TERRORIST SQUADRONS.  

   IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT ARMED ULTRA-RIGHTIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN
TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, INCLUDING JAIR KLEIN, A FORMER ISRAELI ARMY
COLONEL WHO COMMANDED HIS COUNTRY'S ANTITERRORIST CORPS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO SAID
IN A MESSAGE "TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," WHICH WAS ISSUED THIS EVENING
BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, THAT "THE SURVIVAL OF COLOMBIA, ONE OF
THE MOST STABLE AND OLDEST DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA, IS IN DANGER."

   THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT CATEGORICALLY STATED:  "WE CANNOT REST UNTIL WE
HAVE DESTROYED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.  WE HAVE CAPTURED
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTIES AND
AIRCRAFT, AND WE WILL STEADFASTLY PURSUE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS DESPITE THEIR
RESOURCES AND MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS."

   THE PRESIDENCY SAID THAT BARCO'S MESSAGE WAS ALSO BROADCAST BY THE MOST
IMPORTANT TELEVISION NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

   DRUG TRAFFICKERS "MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES
RUNNING FROM A CIVILIZED SOCIETY," BARCO SAID IN HIS MESSAGE.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED THAT "THERE MUST BE NO RESPITE OR HOME FOR THEM" AND
THAT "THERE MUST BE NO MARKET FOR THEIR DRUGS."

   BARCO'S DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS BROADCAST
SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT FABIO OCHOA RESTREPO, FATHER OF JORGE
LUIS, FABIO, AND DAVID OCHOA VASQUEZ -- WHOSE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN REQUESTED
BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES -- SENT A PUBLIC LETTER TO BARCO PROPOSING THAT THEY
START "WITH A CLEAN SLATE."

   BARCO ADDED THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT
JUST STRUGGLING AGAINST COLOMBIA, BECAUSE "THE WHOLE WORLD IS UNITED IN ITS
INDIGNATION AND IN ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE ACTIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY CARRYING
OUT."

   VIRGILIO BARCO SAID DRUG TRAFFICKING IS "A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT IS
BEING NURTURED BY THE HABITS OF MILLIONS OF COCAINE CONSUMERS, SOME OF WHOM
ARE PROBABLY LISTENING."

   "THOSE WHO DEPEND ON COCAINE HAVE PERMITTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOST
VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD HAS KNOWN," THE PRESIDENT
STATED.

   "WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED A MATTER OF PERSONAL HABITS HAS HAD EXPLOSIVE
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY," HE ADDED.

   BARCO WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:  "NATURALLY, IT IS MORE
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REDUCE THE DEMAND THAN FOR US TO REDUCE THE OFFER.  WE
CANNOT FULLY DESTROY DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING
EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS AND WHILE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO CONSUME
ILLEGAL DRUGS SOMEWHERE, IN SOME COUNTRY."

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS 10
DAYS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 28 AUG 89 -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS
AT TOBALABA AIRPORT, THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE [PCCH] HAS ISSUED
THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE:

   THE DICTATORSHIP INTENDS TO USE STILL UNCLEAR INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE A
FEW DAYS AGO AT TOBALABA AIRPORT TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF PROVOCATION AND
ALARM WITH THE PURPOSE OF DISRUPTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL
PROCESS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ON 14 DECEMBER.

   PINOCHET'S OPEN INTERVENTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS
REMAINED CLEAR IN HIS 23 AUGUST SPEECH AND WAS RECENTLY DENOUNCED BY
OPPOSITION LEADER PATRICIO AYLWIN AND BY ALL OPPOSITION POLITICAL FORCES.

   THE DECLARATION ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, CNI -- AN
ORGANIZATION THAT FOR MANY YEARS HAS SHAMEFULLY VIOLATED THE MOST BASIC
RIGHTS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE BY USING THE MOST CRUEL AND INHUMAN FORMS OF
TERROR AND VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILEAN DEMOCRATS AND WHOSE DISSOLUTION HAS BEEN
PROPOSED EVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT'S CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI -- INTENDS TO
MISGUIDE THE PEOPLE BY ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO IMPLICATE THE PCCH IN AN
INCIDENT IN WHICH IT HAD NO PARTICIPATION WHATSOEVER.

   THE CNI DECLARATION, EXPRESSLY ORDERED BY AUTHORITIES OF THE REGIME, GOES
TO THE EXTREME OF INFAMOUSLY MANIPULATING FAMILY TIES TO ATTACK OUR GENERAL
SECRETARY, COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM.

   THE REGIME SEEKS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TERROR AND INTIMIDATION IN ORDER
TO IMPOSE THE ANTIDEMOCRATIC DEMANDS RECENTLY MADE BY PINOCHET.

   TO THIS END, AND AS PINOCHET HIMSELF HAS STATED, THE REGIME IS WILLING
EVEN TO RESORT TO FORCE ONCE AGAIN.  PART OF THIS PLAN IS THE MURDER OF LUIS
VARGAS, WHO WAS ARRESTED AND TORTURED BY THE CNI AND LATER THROWN OUT OF A
FIFTH- FLOOR WINDOW OF THE MILITARY COURT BUILDING AFTER BEING FALSELY
CHARGED WITH HAVING AN ARSENAL IN HIS HOME; THE SCANDALOUS COURT DECISION
THAT LEAVES UNPUNISHED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INHUMAN DEATH OF RODRIGO
ROJAS DENEGRI AND THE SERIOUS INJURY OF CARMEN GLORIA QUINTANA; THE SHAMEFUL
SUPREME COURT DECISION CLEARING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE CRIMES
AGAINST 10 CHILEANS IN LATE 1976; THE REGIME'S INTENTION TO IMPOSE A NEW
AMNESTY LAW TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
PAST 16 YEARS UNPUNISHED; THE ARREST AND INCOMMUNICADO DETENTION OF 13
PEOPLE, AMONG THEM A PREGNANT WOMAN ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENTS AT
THE TOBALABA AIRPORT AND FOR WHOSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRITY WE
FEAR.

   THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF PINOCHET, THE CNI, AND THE CIRCLES CLOSE TO
THE DICTATORSHIP'S DESPAIR IN VIEW OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE DEMOCRATIC
STRUGGLE AND THE GROWING UNITY OF ALL OPOSITION FORCES AROUND A SINGLE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND A COMMON PLATFORM DESIGNED TO DEMOCRATIZE THE
COUNTRY.

   AS ALWAYS WHEN IT FEELS THREATENED, THE DICTATORSHIP HAS DECIDED TO
DIVIDE AND CONFUSE THE OPPOSITION FORCES.

   WE APPEAL TO ALL DEMOCRATS TO COME TOGETHER EVEN MORE FIRMLY SO THE LEVEL
OF UNITY ACHIEVED BY THE OPPOSITION SECTOR WILL NOT ALLOW SUCH MANEUVERS TO
JEOPARDIZE THE RESOLUTE PROGRESS TOWARD THE MUCH DESIRED DEMOCRACY AND
FREEDOM FOR OUR PEOPLE.

   WE ALSO URGE THAT THIS PROVOCATION BE DENOUNCED BY DOUBLING EFFORTS TO
OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEAT THE DICTATORSHIP ON 14 DECEMBER, THUS TAKING A
DECISIVE STEP IN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFINITIVELY OUST THIS REGIME OF HATRED,
DEATH, AND PAIN.

   SIGNED: AMERICO ZORRILLA, JAIME INSUNZA, AND CARLOS MOLINAS FOR THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.

OF THE "WAR" DECLARED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN REPRISAL FOR THE MAJOR
BLOWS THEY HAVE BEEN DEALT BY THE AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF COLOMBIA.  

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL POLICE REPORTS, SIX BOMBS EXPLODED IN MEDELLIN,
THE COUNTRY'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, WHERE THE RESPONSE FROM THE DRUG DEALERS
HAS BEEN MORE STRONGLY FELT IN RECENT DAYS.

   THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN LIQUOR STORES WHERE, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL
ESTIMATES, THE DAMAGE IS EXTENSIVE.

   MEDELLIN WAS THE FIRST CITY HIT BY THE DRUG CARTEL'S "COUNTERATTACK"
AFTER THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES" ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THEY VOWED
TO WAGE A "WAR" ON THE GOVERNMENT, JUDGES, BUSINESSMEN, AND JOURNALISTS
NATIONWIDE.  THE EXTRADITABLES ARE DRUG TRAFFICKERS SOUGHT BY U.S. COURTS.

   ON SUNDAY, NINE BOMBS EXPLODED AND COMPLETELY DESTROYED SEVERAL
STATE-OWNED BANKS.

   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED IN BOGOTA IN FRONT OF A TRAVEL AGENCY,
BUT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE HAS YET TO BE REPORTED.

   THE INTENSE OFFENSIVE BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION BEGAN
2 WEEKS AGO IN THE WAKE OF A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS THAT CLAIMED THE
LIVES OF PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE
OFFICER, AND A JUDGE.

   THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, COMBINED ARMY AND
POLICE FORCES RAIDED SEVERAL PROPERTIES OWNED BY HERNANDO SUAREZ BURGOS,

DEPARTMENT.

   UNITS OF THE ELITE FORCES, THE MAIN ONES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATIONS, ALSO
RAIDED THE PRIVATE RESIDENCE OF BUSINESSMAN EDGARDO BARROS, PRESIDENT OF THE
SPORTING SOCCER CLUB OF CALI.

   POLICE SPOKESMEN ALSO REPORTED TODAY THAT MORE THAN 7,000 PEOPLE WHO HAD
BEEN ARRESTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE OFFENSIVE WERE RELEASED WHEN IT WAS
FULLY PROVEN THEY HAD NO LINKS WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS.

   MEANWHILE, APPROXIMATELY 4,000 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AWAITING JUDICIAL

FAR BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

HEADS IN COLOMBIA, THE LATTER HAD LAVISHED PRAISE ON THE ASSISTANCE EXTENDED
BY OUR DEFENSE SECTOR TO COLOMBIA.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SHAHAL] IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  ISRAEL TRAINED
COLOMBIAN DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT ELEMENTS; THIS WAS DONE IN THE
CUSTOMARY WAY AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEFENSE MINISTER.  COLOMBIA
BOUGHT SECURITY PRODUCTS FROM ISRAEL, SUCH AS THE KFIR PLANES, WHICH
WERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COAL PURCHASE.  ON THE DAY I MET WITH THE
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HE SIGNED AN ORDER APPROVING THE PURCHASE OF THE

BOGOTA CONFIRMED TODAY THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE 10,797 PEOPLE
ARRESTED AFTER SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ON 18 AUGUST HAVE BEEN
RELEASED.

   THE RELEASES TOOK PLACE AS THE PREVENTIVE ARREST DEADLINES ESTABLISHED IN
THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREES ISSUED ON 25 AUGUST BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S
LIBERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO EXPIRE.

   COLONEL EDUARDO AREVALO, PRESS DIRECTOR FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, TOLD
AFP THAT THE AUTHORITIES COULD ONLY DETAIN SUSPECTS FOR 7 WORKING DAYS.

   IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT WHEN ARRESTS ARE MADE ON SPECIFIC DRUG TRAFFICKING
CHARGES, HE EXPLAINED.

   "THERE ARE NO EXACT FIGURES REGARDING THE PERSONS RELEASED, BUT I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF THE DETAINEES ARE INVOLVED," COL
AREVALO SAID.

   THAT PROPORTION OF THE ALMOST 10,797 DETENTIONS MADE DURING THE
OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AGAINST COMMON CRIMINALS AND
PRESUMED ACCOMPLICES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS, LEADS TO THE ASSUMPTION
THAT APPROXIMATELY 3,500 PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY AT THE JAILS, POLICE
INSPECTION OFFICES, AND OTHER BRANCHES.

   THE LEGAL SITUATION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AS THEIR
TERMS EXPIRE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, AREVALO SAID.

   AREVALO EXPLAINED TO AFP THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW DIFFICULTIES
REGARDING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND ARRESTED, ADDING THAT THE
DIFFICULTIES STEM FROM THE WORK STOPPAGE IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN PROTEST
OVER THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE CARLOS VALENCIA IN BOGOTA.  

   HE SAID THAT AMONG THE DETAINEES ARE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE
EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES.

   ONE OF THE EXTRADITABLES IS EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, CAPTURED WHILE HE
WAS VACATIONING ON HIS FARM IN TOLU, A VILLAGE IN THE NORTHWESTERN PROVINCE
OF SUCRE ON THE CARIBBEAN COAST, APPROXIMATELY 750 KM FROM BOGOTA, AND HIS
TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT.

   THE PROCEDURES FOR MARTINEZ ROMERO'S EXTRADITION WERE CARRIED OUT
UNEVENTFULLY AFTER THE U.S. EMBASSY MADE THE REQUEST.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN

SUPREME COURT SUSPENDED THE DEADLINES FOR THE ELECTION OF JUSTICES AT 27
HIGHER COURTS.

   THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE
10 WORKING DAYS TO STATE THEIR POSITIONS REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF THE

AUTHORIZING FUTURE EXTRADITIONS.

   "WE MUST NOT ACT HASTILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ERRORS.  SOME OF

LIBERTO GUTIERREZ MARQUEZ, THE ALLEGED FRONT MAN OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL AND
BROTHER OF A FORMER COLOMBIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL, WAS FOUND MURDERED TODAY

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT LIBERTO GUTIERREZ HAD RECENTLY DISAPPEARED AND
APPARENTLY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY (EPL)

SOME STATEMENTS MADE EXCLUSIVELY TO MADRID RADIO BY A FORMER MEMBER OF
THE CHILEAN SECRET POLICE.  JOSE MANUEL MARTIN MEDEM REPORTS:

   [MARTIN MEDEM] THE EXILES FROM CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND URUGUAY REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, THE
ARMED FORCES OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF LATIN AMERICA ACTED JOINTLLY, WITHOUT
RESPECTING BORDERS, IN REPRESSION.  IN THIS WAY, THEY WERE ABLE TO KIDNAP AN
EXILE FROM WHERE HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND MAKE HIM RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF
ORIGIN, WHERE MANY WERE TORTURED AND MURDERED.  OUR COLLEAGUE, JAVIER
GONZALEZ, HAS NOW MANAGED A WITNESS REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THESE ACCUSATIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] A FORMER MEMBER OF DINA [NATIONAL
INTELLEGENCE DIRECTORATE], THE CHILEAN SECRET SERVICE UNDER PINOCHET,
HAS ASKED REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN SPAIN.  HE IS JUAN JOSE SOTO
VARGAS, WHO WORKED IN THE DINA CITIZENS' INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE.  HE HAS
TURNED AWAY FROM THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE MAINTAINED HIS IDEOLOGICAL
STANCE.  SOTO VARGAS, A DOCTOR BY PROFESSION AND A PASTOR OF AN
EVANGELICAL CHURCH, HAS MADE EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO MADRID RADIO IN
WHICH HE CONFIRMS POLICE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REGION'S MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF STATE TERRORISM.

   [SOTO VARGAS] WE, IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY, WORKED WITH THE ARGENTINE
FEDERAL POLICE AND WITH THE ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST
SUBVERSION IN 1976 AND SHORTLY BEFORE ISABEL MARTINEZ DE PERON LEFT POWER.
WE ALSO WORKED JOINTLY WITH THE SECURITY FORCES OF URAGUAY, PARAGUAY, AND
BRAZIL.  I WORKED IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN BRAZIL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AGENCY.  WELL,
RELATIONS WERE THE BEST AND THIS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SOUTH AMERICAN ARMED
FORCES, AT TO INSTALL ITSELF IN SOUTH AMERICA OR TO IMPOSE ITSELF THROUGH
GUERRILLA TACTICS AND VIOLENCE.

   [GONZALEZ] SOTO VARGAS HAS ALREADY REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH HE HAS HAD TO LEAVE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.  HE
SAYS THAT HE DID NOT TORTURE OR KILL ANYONE AND THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DID
NOT HAPPEN IN CHILE.  HOWEVER, HE ADMITS THAT GENERAL CARLOS PRATS, THE HEAD
OF THE ARMY UNDER PRESIDENT ALLENDE, WAS ASSASSINATED IN BUENOS AIRES UNDER
ORDERS OF THE PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.

   [SOTO VARGAS] THERE IS PROOF, EVEN JUDICIAL PROOF, THAT THERE WAS
PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN ARMY WHO WERE ORDERED
TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WORKED IN THE MILITARY
SECTION OF THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN ARGENTINA, GEN VICTOR HUGO BARRIERA

GENERAL OF THE FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLANNED THE POLICE ACTION IN
A MEETING WITH GENERAL AUGUSTO RODRIGUES ARANGO OF THE SOUTHERN
UNIFIED COMMAND AND COLONEL LUIS FERNANDO GUZMAN VASQUEZ OF ARMY
HEADQUARTERS IN LETICIA, COLOMBIA.

   TUMA SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS LEFT MEDELLIN AND CALI IN SMALL
AIRPLANES, PROBABLY WITH FALSE DOCUMENTS, TO GO TO MANAUS, WHERE THEY WOULD
PREPARE TO LEAVE FOR EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES.  ALL THE HOTELS OF MANAUS
ARE UNDER STRICT SURVEILLANCE.

   THE FIRST ATTEMPTS BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO ENTER BRAZIL WERE
DISCOVERED WHEN THE POLICE FOUND THREE IMPORTED CARS.  THE CARS, WHICH ARE
LUXURY MODELS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN, ARE INCLUDED IN A LIST OF
26 CARS SENT TO THE FEDERAL POLICE BY THE COLOMBIAN JUSTICE MINISTRY.  THE
CARS WERE LEFT BY AN UNIDENTIFIED COLOMBIAN AT A CAR WASH IN TABATINGA.  AS
THE CARS WERE NOT PICKED UP BY THEIR OWNERS FOR SEVERAL DAYS, THE OWNER OF

ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS AT WAR.  THE RICALDONE
INSITUTE IS ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT SCHOOLS RUN BY SALESIAN PRIESTS
IN EL SALVADOR.

   FATHER CORO STATED DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT STUDENT MIGUEL
ERNESTO MIRANDA REINA, 18, "WHO WAS THE BEST MECHANICS STUDENT IN THE
INSTITUTE,' WAS DESPICABLY AND COWARDLY SHOT IN THE BACK WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO APPROACH HIS HOUSE IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR ON 22 AUGUST.
FATHER CORO ACCUSED THE "ATLACATL" BATTALION SOLDIERS, PARTICULARLY AN
OFFICER, "A LIEUTENANT, SERGEANT, OR WHOMEVER," WHO LATER ATTEMPTED TO
DISTORT THE EVENT BY STATING THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT WAS A "REBEL"
BECAUSE HE WORE REBEL BOOTS AND HAD A REBEL BOOK.

   THE SALESIAN PRIEST, WHO HAS LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY
FOR THE PAST 16 YEARS, SAID THAT THE STUDENT WAS RETURNING HOME AFTER
WORKING ON HIS THESIS AS HE WAS TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR.  THE STUDENT
WORE THE SCHOOL'S UNIFORM, HAD HIS IDENTIFICATION PAPERS, AND CARRIED
A BOOK ON RELIGION THAT SHOWED JESUS CHRIST WITH A BEARD ON ITS COVER.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL AN INNOCENT
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS AN HONOR STUDENT, THE SOLDIERS HAD STARTED TO KEEP A
WATCH ON THE INSTITUTE, TO STOP STUDENTS TO HARRASS THEM MENTALLY BY
ASKING THEM IF THEY KNEW MIRANDA REINA, TO PLACE A CHECKPOINT IN FRONT
OF THE MURDERED STUDENT'S HOME, AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES.  HE ADDED
THAT IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT STOPPED, THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY IN EL
SALVADOR WILL PROTEST TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY FEELS AFFECTED BY
THESE ACTIONS AS THEIR SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS EDUCATED THE YOUNG SO THAT
THEY CAN EARN A LIVILIHOOD AND THAT THESE MEASURES -- POSSIBLY ORDERED
BY MID-LEVEL COMMANDERS -- HINDER THEIR ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES

EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE USED IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT THE POLICE DO NOT HAVE "EXACT
INFORMATION," GEN GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS
SEIZED IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS FROM THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATIONS-- INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS, AND PROPERTY TITLES--"ALLOW US
TO PROGRESS IN OUR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
NETWORKS."

   THE POLICE CHIEF ADDED THAT "THE POLICE ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING
THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED.  NO POLITICAL OR PUBLIC FIGURE HAS BEEN FOUND TO
BE INVOLVED WITH NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AS A RESULT OF THESE PAPERS,"
HE SAID, BUT HE ADMITTED THAT BRIBERY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
"ELEMENTS OF DESTABILIZATION" THAT THE MULTIMILLIONAIRE COCAINE MAFIAS
USE.

   GEN GOMEZ PADILLA ADMITTED THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO BEEN
THE VICTIM OF BRIBERY CASES.  "THANK GOD THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CASES,
JUST FOUR OR FIVE," BUT THESE HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN TIME AND THOSE
FOUND HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT "WE HAVE HAD SOME EXEMPLARY MEN WHO HAVE GIVEN
THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL WORK."

   IN THE LAST 3 YEARS, 1,300 POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE WORKING
ON CASES RELATED TO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING, GOMEZ PADILLA REPORTED.  HE
ALSO ADMITTED HE HIMSELF HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS.

   MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA STRESSED BEFORE THE FOREIGN PRESS THAT
"COLOMBIA IS A SOVEREIGN NATION THAT HAS A VERY QUALIFIED AND
PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES," AND THAT IN ORDER TO FIGHT NARCOTICS
TERRORISM "WE DO NOT NEED FOREIGN FORCES."

   WITH THIS REMARK, GEN GOMEZ AGAIN REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE
UNITED STATES MIGHT SEND TROOPS TO FIGHT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
GROUPS IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.

   "THE FACT WE NEED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT IS SOMETHING
ELSE," THE POLICE CHIEF SAID, ADDING THAT "WE WELCOME ANY AMOUNT OF
MONEY."

   GOMEZ PADILLA POINTED OUT THAT "AS NEVER BEFORE, THE ARMY, THE
SECRET AGENTS, AND THE POLICE ARE TRULY COMITTED TO THE STRUGGLE AND
HAVE ASSIGNED 80,000 UNITS TO FIGHT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AGAINST
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING."

   AS OF 18 AUGUST, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED ITS MOST RECENT
 OFFENSIVE AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND ADOPTED MEASURES THAT
INCLUDED EXTRADITON, THE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COCAINE "HAS
NEARLY STOPPED," GOMEZ PADILLA SAID.

   THE GENERAL STATED THAT THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE SEEKING NEW
MARKETING ROUTES AND NEW BORDER AREAS TO INSTALL THE COCAINE REFINING
LABORATORIES.

   HE ADDED THE COLOMBIAN TOPOGRAPHY -- MOUNTAINOUS AND WITH VERY
DENSE JUNGLES -- CONCEALS THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR
INSTALLATIONS, "BUT SOONER OR LATER WE ARE GOING TO FIND THEM; THEY
CANNOT HIDE FOREVER."

   TAIPEI (TAIWAN), 4 SEPT 89 (CNA) -- [TEXT] THE PRESIDENTS OF THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA JOINTLY DENOUNCED
TERRORISTS AND DRUG-PUSHERS AS "TWO MAJOR POLLUTIONS OF THE WORLD"
MONDAY.

   IN A JOINT COMMUNIQUE THEY SIGNED BEFORE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT MARCO
VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO CONCLUDED HIS SIX-DAY VISIT HERE, THE TWO HEADS
OF STATE REITERATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO PROMOTE WORLD PEACE AND
INTERNATIONAL CO-PROSPERITY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENT LI TENG-HUI SIGNED ON THE COMMUNIQUE
IN TAIPEI MONDAY MORNING.  THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENTIAL ENTOURAGE LEFT
FOR HOME IN THE AFTERNOON.

   THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THE WORLD COUNTRIES SHOULD RESPECT EACH OTHER'S
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, RESPECT THEIR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM OF CHOICE, AND
REFRAIN FROM INTEFERING WITH DOMESTIC AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

   EVERY COUNTRY'S FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD ALSO BE GOVERNED BY THE
PRINCIPLES OF PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO DISPUTES, NOT INVADING OTHERS'
TERRITORIES, AND RESPECTING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF NATURAL RESOURCES OF
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, SAID THE COMMUNIQUE.

   CEREZO AND LI EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER ARMAMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL
DISPUTES WHICH MIGHT AGGRAVATE TENSION IN THE WORLD.

   THEY ALSO "STRONGLY DENOUNCED" ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS AND PLANTING
AND PUSHING OF DRUGS, SAYING THE TWO ARE "MAJOR POLLUTIONS OF THE
WORLD."

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS POINTED OUT THAT PEACE EFFORTS REAFFIRMED BY
FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN THREE RECENT SUMMITS TO PROMOTE
MUTUAL RESPECT AND PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE ARE "EXTREMELY IMPORTANT."

   THE ROC AND GUATEMALAN PRESIDENTS SAID THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE
SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF BILATERAL TIES, REAFFIRMING THEIR RESOLUTE
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE AND STRENGTHEN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.

   THEIR JOINT REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TREATIES AND
ACCORDS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CONCLUDED THAT THESE BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS HAVE FORMED A BROAD BASE FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR
RESPECTIVE DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNIQUE.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO THANKED PRESIDENT LI FOR THE ROC'S FINANCIAL,
AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCES TO GUATEMALA.
THE TWO SAID THESE COOPERATIVE PROJECTS SHOULD CONTINUE.

   THE TWO HEADS OF STATE ALSO EXPRESSED SATISFACTION OVER INCREASING
EXCHANGES OF VISITS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
PROMOTED ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

   THEY AGREED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION SHOULD
CONTINUE IN ORDER TO BOOST MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP AND BENEFIT THEIR
PEOPLES.

   RECOGNIZING CULTURAL AND SPORTS EXCHANGES' CONTRIBUTION TO
CONSOLIDATING BILATERAL FRIENDSHIP AND PROMOTING PEACE, THE TWO
PRESIDENTS AGREED TO STRENGTHEN THE EXCHANGES BY INCREASING
INVITATIONS AND QUOTA FOR SCHOLARSHIPS.

   CEREZO IN THE MEANTIME CORDIALLY INVITED PRESIDENT LI TO VISIT
GUATEMALA.  THE LATTER ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH GREAT PLEASURE,
AND ASKED THEIR STAFFS TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS.

   DURING HIS STAY HERE, CEREZO HAS BEEN WARMLY AND COURTEOUSLY
WELCOMED AND TREATED.  HE HAS ALSO BEEN CONFERRED AN ODER OF THE
HIGHEST HONOR TO A CIVILIAN LEADER.  BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE, HE GAVE A
PRESS CONFERENCE TO TALK ABOUT HIS VISIT.

   BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] MEDELLIN -- AN
BOMBING ATTACK ATTACK ON 3 AUGUST OCCURRED AT A BRANCH OF BANCO
POPULAR, AT THE INTERSECTION OF 49TH AVENUE AND 50TH STREET, ITAGUI
MUNICIPALITY, TO THE SOUTH OF ABURRA VALLEY. FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE
INJURED, AND SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE OCCURRED.

   THE INJURED WERE 19-YEAR-OLD ROBINSON RAMIREZ, 30-YEAR-OLD ROBERTO
ARCESIO PABON, AND 40-YEAR-OLD HUGO MORALES, AND TWO OTHER
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TREATED AT ITAGUI'S SAN RAFAEL

   AN OFFICIAL REPORT STATES THAT THE BLAST COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE
BANK FACILITIES AND CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO NEARBY BUSINESSES AND
SEVERAL AREA RESIDENCES.

   IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS NEW ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT A FEW
MINUTES BEFORE THE 5TH DAY OF A CURFEW, WHICH WAS ORDERED ON 30 AUGUST
BY THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.  IN ORDERING A CURFEW, THE MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ.

PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 12 WERE WOUNDED TODAY, INCLUDING 3 MEMBERS OF
THE ANTIOQUIA POLICE, IN AN ATTACK AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT
IN RIONEGRO.

   SEVERAL MEN TRAVELING IN TWO VEHICLES ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT'S MAIN

WEARING COLOMBIAN ARMY FATIGUES, GOT OUT OF A RED RENAULT AND
INDISCRIMINATELY OPENED FIRE ON THE PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDERGOING ROUTINE
SEARCHES AT THE AIRPORT ENTRANCE.  ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, AND 12 WERE
WOUNDED.  THE AIRPORT SECURITY POLICE THEN KILLED THE ATTACKER.  THERE
WAS GENERAL CHAOS AT THE AIRPORT, A SITUATION THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A
GREATER TRAGEDY.  THE MOTIVES AND THE IDENTITIES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE NEW VIOLENCE ARE SO FAR UNKNOWN.

DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.  THE PLANE HAD BEEN FLYING TO CALI LAST WEEK,
BUT IT HAD TO LAND AT THE LOS GARZONES AIRPORT, LOCATED 10 MINUTES
FROM MONTERIA, AFTER DEVELOPING MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES.

   THE C-123 HERCULES PLANE WAS DYNAMITED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AS
IT SAT IN A DARK SECTION OF THE LOS GARZONES AIRPORT OF MONTERIA.
AIRPORT SOURCES SAID THE GRAY PLANE HAD BEEN IN ROUTE TO CALI LAST
WEEK, BUT ITS CREW HAD TO LEAVE IT IN MONTERIA BECAUSE OF ITS
MECHANICAL DEFECTS.  THE POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS PLACED
UNDERNEATH THE PLANE.  THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED A LARGE PART OF THE
CABIN, INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND CONTROLS.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED DURING
A HEAVY DOWNPOUR.  THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NO
CASUALTIES.

   THE AIRPLANE WAS UNDER SPECIAL PROTECTION, BUT THE GUARDS WERE
INSIDE THE AIRPORT WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  ONLY THE AIRPORT
PERSONNEL AND CIVIL AERONAUTICS WATCHMEN WERE AT THE TERMINAL WHEN THE
EXPLOSION OCCURRED.

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] FULLY AWARE OF OUR
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE, THE PCCH AND THE
LEFTIST SECTOR, AS PART OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL SPARE NO SACRIFICE TO
SECURE AN IMPORTANT VICTORY BY ELECTING PATRICIO AYLWIN PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC AND ESTABLISHING A DECISIVE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS FOR THE
OPPOSITION, INCLUDING THE UNITED LEFT AND THE PAIS [BROAD PARTY OF THE
SOCIALIST LEFT].

   IN OUR OPINION, SAID VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THIS IS NOT JUST AN
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.  WE DO NOT SEE IT AS SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIAL
MOBILIZATION CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE BURDENED BY HUNDREDS OF DAILY
PROBLEMS, A MOBILIZATION TO RECOVER THEIR RIGHTS TO FOOD, JOBS,
HEALTH, HOUSING, AND EDUCATION -- TO A WAY OF LIFE WORTHY OF HUMAN
BEINGS.

   FIVE OR SIX MILLION HUNGRY AND POOR CHILEANS IS A SCANDAL, AND THEY
DESERVE A SHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THOSE WHO TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT.

   WE NEED TO DEMAND AND DEFEND THE RESPECT FOR LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN
GUARANTEED DURING THESE PAST 16 YEARS IN OUR FATHERLAND.  A SINGLE DAY
DOES NOT GO BY WITHOUT A DEFENDER OF FREEDOM BECOMING A VICTIM OF THE
REGIME'S REPRESSIVE APPARATUS.

   THE COMMUNIST REPRESENTATIVE ADDED: WE WANT PEACE FOR CHILE.  WE
WANT THE DEADLY VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM UNLEASHED ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973
TO END ONCE AND FOR ALL.

   THE CHILEAN DILEMMA CONTINUES TO BE DEMOCRACY OR DICTATORSHIP,
LIBERTY OR TYRANNY, PERPETUATION IN POWER OR A NEW LIFE.  VOLODIA
TEITELBOIM HAS INDEED MADE A CALL TO GET ORGANIZED, TO UNITE, AND TO
CONVINCE.  THE PERPETUATION OF POWER IS NOW CALLED HERNAN BUCHI.  WE
MUST ALL UNITE TO DEFEAT PINOCHET.  BUCHI IS HIS MAN.

   TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.
THEY JUST HAD TO CHANGE A LETTER OF BUCHI'S PROPAGANDISTIC SLOGANS TO
RESTORE THE TRUTH: BUCHI IS NOT THE MAN; RATHER, HE REPRESENTS HUNGER.

   IN ITS 15TH CONGRESS THE PCCH MADE A CALL TO DEFEAT THE MINISTER
WHO HAS MADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POOR, THE MINISTER WHO HAS NOW BECOME
A DEMAGOGUE AND IS PROMISING THE MOON AND AN UNREALISTIC WORLD FOR THE
PEOPLE; THAT IS, THE MINISTER WHO IS PROMISING EVERYTHING HE FAILED TO
ACCOMPLISH IN HIS YEARS AS MINISTER.

   BUCHI'S INSINCERE PROMISES ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY ANOTHER TALKATIVE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE REGIME: MR ERRAZURIZ.

   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM THEN ADDED: IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE VICTORY OF
DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE UNITED FORCES OF ALL THOSE
WHO HOPE FOR LIBERTY.

   WE HEREBY CALL FOR THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF COMMANDOS FOR
DEMOCRACY AND BROAD COMMITTEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DISPLAY
INITIATIVES, ENCOURAGE IMAGINATION, AND FORM CARAVANS OF PEOPLE WHO
WILL GIVE EXPLANATIONS FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON,
IMPLEMENTING A FERVENT AND OVERWHELMING DYNAMIC CAPABLE OF CHANGING
CHILE ON 14 DECEMBER 1989.

   OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THE CRUCIAL
CROSSROADS OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  THEY ARE PLAYING IT NOW, FIGHTING
WHOLEHEARTEDLY, CONVINCED THAT THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY WILL REPRESENT
A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EMPHATIC AND
RIGHTEOUS NO TO IMPUNITY, AND A SUBSTANTIVE YES TO LIBERTY FOR ALL
POLITICAL PRISONERS AND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE CENTER].

   THE OUTSTANDING COMMUNIST LEADER AND INTELLECTUAL SAID THAT THESE
ARE DAYS FOR GENEROSITY AND SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR.  SEEKING DEMOCRACY, WE
ARE SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISAGREEMENTS
IN THE PAST.  WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE MOTIVATED BY
DIFFERENT POLITICAL CONCEPTS, THIS IS A CREATIVE TIME FOR A COMMON
DENOMINATOR, JOINT ACTIONS, AND FOR EVERYONE TO LEND A HAND.

   IF THE OPPOSITION MARCHES UNITED TOWARD 14 DECEMBER, IT WILL
ACHIEVE A OVERWHELMING VICTORY THAT WILL BE REGISTERED IN CHILEAN
HISTORY AS A GOLDEN DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE.

   SUCH A VICTORY WILL FINALLY RESTORE A RIGHT THAT HAS REPEATEDLY
BEEN REQUESTED AND VIOLATED: THE RIGHT TO REJOICE AND TO TRUST IN THE
FUTURE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE WILL SLIP UNNOTICED THROUGH THE
SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TO KILL A CHILEAN WITH IMPUNITY.

   THE PEOPLE, ADDED VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, ARE BEGINNING TO PAINT THE
WALLS WITH A SLOGAN: THE PEOPLE WIN, THE DICTATORSHIP IS OVER.  THE
DICTATORSHIP WILL END AND THE PEOPLE WILL WIN.

   IF WE WIN IN 14 DECEMBER AND DOUBTLESSLY WE WILL, AND IF WE --
ALWAYS ACTING IN UNISON -- IMMEDIATELY SPOIL PINOCHET'S PLANS, WE WILL
[WORD INDISTINCT] THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PERPETUAL
BOSS.

   THE TOP LEADER OF CHILEAN COMMUNISTS WARNED THAT THE DANGERS AND
DIFFICULTIES DEMAND THAT WE REMAIN ALERT AND WORK EVEN HARDER.  WE
MUST BURY ALL ATTEMPTS BY THE GENERAL AND HIS FAITHFULS TO STOP OR
REVERSE CHILE'S PROGRESS TOWARD NEW HORIZONS.

   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN, DURING A
MEETING AT THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PARTY OFFICES,
EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MAKE ALL CHILEANS ACTIVE AGAIN IN DEMOCRATIC
LIFE.  THIS PURPOSE REFLECTS THE SENTIMENTS OF A VAST MAJORITY OF THE
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY PAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP AND PUT AN
END TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NEGLECT AND TO THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN
HUMANS, BETWEEN PARIAHS AND PRIVILEGED ONES, AND BETWEEN FIRST-CLASS,
SECOND-CLASS, OR THIRD-CLASS PEOPLE, WHERE SOME ENJOY EVERY RIGHT
WHILE OTHERS ARE DENIED EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE.

   IN HIS SPEECH OVER A PARTIAL RADIO NETWORK, THE PCCH SECRETARY
GENERAL SAID: WE DREAM ABOUT AND STRIVE FOR A CHILE WITHOUT MISSING
PEOPLE, WITHOUT EXECUTED PEOPLE, WITHOUT BURNED YOUTHS, WITHOUT
POLITICAL PRISONERS, WITHOUT EXILES -- A FATHERLAND OF EQUALS AMONG
EQUALS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 4 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] OFFICIALS FROM COLOMBIA'S AVIANCA
AIRLINE DENIED REPORTS TODAY THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN FOUND AND DEFUSED
INSIDE ONE OF ITS AIRPLANES IN THE CITY OF MEDELLIN.  THIS REPORT IS
RELATED TO THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUGTRAFFICKING MAFIA HAS DECLARED ON
THE COUNTRY, A WAR THAT HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED IN RECENT HOURS.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, POLICE ANTI-EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DEFUSED A
POWERFUL CHARGE OF DYNAMITE FOUND IN AN AVIANCA 727 PLANE THAT ARRIVED
IN MEDELLIN FROM PEREIRA WITH 180 PASSENGERS ABOARD.

   THE REPORT, BROADCAST BY A TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM AFTER HAVING
BEEN CONFIRMED BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS OFFICIAL, STATED THAT THE BOMB
WAS FOUND BY THE PLANE'S CREW MEMBERS AFTER THEY DETECTED A HEAVY
SMELL OF POWDER SHORTLY AFTER LANDING.

   THIS SITUATION, WHICH HAS BEEN BLAMED ON THE "NERVOUSNESS" THE
COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING, TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER A MAN
DRESSED IN A CAMOUFLAGE MILITARY UNIFORM KILLED 1 PERSON AND WOUNDED
13 OTHERS WITH A MACHINEGUN AT MEDELLIN'S JOSE MARIA CORDOBA

   MEDELLIN, 4 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A NEW TERRORIST ACTION SHOOK
MEDELLIN IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA THIS EVENING WHEN TWO MEN RIDING ON
A MOTORCYCLE THREW AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AT A POLICE POST LOCATED IN THE
EXCLUSIVE SUBURB OF EL POBLADO.  MIRACULOUSLY, THE THREE POLICEMEN AND
TWO CIVILIANS WHO WERE INSIDE ESCAPED INJURY.

   THE POST, KNOWN AS AN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTER (CAI), WHICH PLAYS
THE ROLE OF A POLICE CONTROL POST, WAS DESTROYED BY THE EXPLOSION OF
THE DEVICE.

   THREE POLICEMEN AND TWO CIVILIANS WERE INSIDE THE POST, WHICH WAS
NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY BUILT, BUT
MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

   ONE OF THE POLICEMEN TOLD AFP THAT THEY SAW TWO MEN ON A MOTORCYCLE
SWIFTLY PASSING BY THE CAI AND THEN THROWING A RED PLASTIC BAG.

   THE THREE POLICEMEN AND THE TWO CIVILIANS MANAGED TO RUN A FEW
METERS DOWN THE STREET BEFORE THE DEVICE EXPLODED.

   ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE'S POWER HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED BY EXPERTS,
THE DETONATION WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE STRUCTURE, MEASURING
APPROXIMATELY 11 SQUARE METERS.

   PRECISELY 1 MONTH AGO THE SAME CAI HAD BEEN DESTROYED WHEN ITS
WALLS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED.

   A WOMAN WHO PASSED THROUGH THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK WAS
NOT INJURED EITHER, EVEN THOUGH HER VEHICLE SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE
DAMAGE, PARTICULARLY THE WINDOWS, WHICH WERE DESTROYED.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION OCCURRED 12 HOURS AFTER A MAN WAS INVOLVED
IN A SPECTACULAR SHOOT-OUT AT THE JOSE MARIA CORDOBA AIRPORT IN
MEDELLIN, WHERE THE GUNMAN AND A YOUNG MAN DIED AND 10 PERSONS WERE
WOUNDED, INCLUDING THREE POLICEMEN.

   THE CAI'S DESTRUCTION OCCURRED 4 HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE
CURFEW, IMPOSED BY MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ 6 DAYS AGO IN AN ATTEMPT
TO CURTAIL THE TERRORIST ACTIONS WHICH HAVE SHAKEN THE CITY,

KILLED SOME 50 METERS FROM THE BERNARDO O'HIGGINS PROMENADE, AT 10
WEST BULNES STREET. THE STREET IS POORLY ILLUMINATED. IT IS BELIEVED
THAT THERE WERE NO EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, TWO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WERE USED; ONE A

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [REPORT] [RICHARD JACOBSEN]
[TEXT] A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL MEET WITH LEFTIST
REBELS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER IN A PRELIMINARY DIALOGUE TO END ALMOST 10
YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, IT WAS REPORTED TODAY BY A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL ANNOUNCE ON 7 SEPTEMBER THE
CREATION OF A COMMISSION AND THE DATE AND PLACE OF THE TALKS WITH THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) REPRESENTATIVES, IT
WAS STATED BY COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER MAURICIO SANDOVAL.

   "THE MEETING WILL BE HELD BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER," SANDOVAL TOLD
REUTER.

   SANDOVAL'S STATEMENTS WERE GIVEN AFTER FMLN COMMANDER ANA GUADALUPE
MARTINEZ SAID TODAY IN MEXICO CITY THAT THE REBELS HAD ACCEPTED A
GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL TO HOLD TALKS BEFORE 15 SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY
OF EL SALVADOR'S INDEPENDENCE.

   "WE THINK THAT THE MEETING COULD BE HELD IN MEXICO CITY, AND ON 7
SEPTEMBER WE WILL ANNOUNCE A SERIES OF MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE
DIALOGUE" -- THE FIRST BETWEEN CRISTIANI'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN, MARTINEZ SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE.

   SHE DID NOT RULE OUT THE DECLARATION OF AN UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE.
"PERHAPS YES, PERHAPS NO," MARTINEZ ANSWERED WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT.

   SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE TALKS COULD BE HELD IN COSTA RICA OR MEXICO.

   "IT IS ALMOST SURE THAT THE TALKS WILL BE HELD IN MEXICO," HE SAID.

   SANDOVAL SAID THAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED TOWARD THE TALKS WAS PROOF
OF THE PLEDGE ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS SWORN IN ON 1 JUNE
TO SOLVE A CONFLICT WHICH HAS COST EL SALVADOR MORE THAN 70,000 LIVES.

   "SPECIFIC STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE," HE SAID.

   GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS
WILL PROBABLY PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE, MORE SUBSTANTIAL,
TALKS.

   SANDOVAL DID NOT SAY WHO WOULD COMPRISE THE GOVERNMENT'S DIALOGUE
COMMISSION BUT OFFICIALS HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND
THE CHURCH WOULD NOT BE REPRESENTED -- A PREVIOUS FMLN DEMAND.

   "WE ACCEPT THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION THAT WILL ATTEND THE
DIALOGUE BE COMPOSED AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS," COMMANDER MARTINEZ SAID
TODAY.  "WE BELIEVE IT IS NEGATIVE FOR THE ARMY NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN
A DIALOGUE WHERE THE WAR WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IT WILL BE A MISTAKE FOR
THE MILITARY NOT TO ATTEND THE MEETING."

   VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO TOLD REPORTERS ON 4 SEPTEMBER THAT
THE ARMED FORCES -- AND THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES -- WOULD BE
INCLUDED IN WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A "SUPPORT COMMISSION" THAT WOULD
PLAY AN ADVISORY ROLE IN THE TALKS.

   THREE ROUNDS OF TALKS BETWEEN THE FMLN AND PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON
DUARTE'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONCLUDED ITS TERM ON
1 JUNE, FAILED TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF A CIVIL WAR.

   TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PEACE DIALOGUE OCCURRED AMID FIERCE
CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND REBELS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF EL
SALVADOR.

   A MAJOR CLASH OCCURRED IN EASTERN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE
REBELS KILLED 14 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS.

   THE ARMED FORCES ALSO SAID THEY HAD CAUSED "NUMEROUS" REBEL
CASUALTIES DURING A CLASH WHICH OCCURRED NEAR CHILANGA, BUT THEY

PROPOSAL IS A GOOD ONE AND THE ARMED FORCES APPLAUDS IT, AND IS IN A
POSITION TO ACCEPT IT, AS LONG AS THE FMLN ALSO COMPLIES WITH IT. [END

   SPEAKING AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, COL MONTANO SAID THAT THE MAIMED
FMLN FIGHTERS' PRESENCE AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL IS AN INDICATION
THAT FMLN LEADERS ABANDON THEIR FIGHTERS WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE USEFUL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] I BELIEVE THAT IF THE FMLN WANTED TO
SEND THOSE PEOPLE ABROAD, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, THEY COULD
VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO.  THEY HAVE THE FIGHTERS AT THE CATHEDRAL FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INHUMANE.  I HAVE EVEN READ AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY FMLN ALLIES WHO
SAY THAT THE SITUATION OF THE MAIMED CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED FOR
HUMANITARIAN REASONS.  HOWEVER, DID THEY DISPLAY HUMANENESS WHEN THEY
BURNED BUSES, LEFT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, OR DESTROYED SO
MANY THINGS THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC? [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE HOMILY DELIVERED YESTERDAY BY MONSIGNOR GREGORIO
ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WHO ACCUSED THE AIR
FORCE OF BOMBING THE SANTA ELENA CHURCH IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, COL
MONTANO SAID THAT SOME LEFTIST CLERGYMEN DISTORT THE FACTS FOR
PROPAGANDA PURPOSES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTANO] WITH THEIR HUMANITARIAN IMAGE, THEY
OFTEN OPPOSE THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, THEY OPPOSE THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIZATION AND, IN FACT, THEY OFTEN PLAY UP TO THE FMLN.  IN
REALITY THEIR ATTACKS AND DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES
ARE UNFAIR.  THEY BLAME THE ARMY FOR THINGS IT IS NOT GUILTY OF OR
RESPONSIBLE FOR. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 SEP 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AFFIRMED TODAY THAT MANY OF THE SALVADORAN REFUGEES IN
HONDURAS ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS BUT THAT HE WILL MAKE A "GOOD
WILL" GESTURE TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 3,800 OF THEM REPATRIATED.

   "THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING A GOOD WILL GESTURE BY ACCEPTING THE
REPATRIATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHILE KNOWING THAT MANY OF
THEM ARE RELATIVES OF CRIMINAL TERRORISTS (GUERRILLAS), SAID
SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT AND INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO.

   THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS AND THE UN HIGH
COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES ARE PREPARING THE RETURN OF THESE
SALVADORANS WHO FLED TO HONDURAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE TO
ESCAPE FROM THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   MERINO STATED: "WE WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF AT ANY GIVEN
MOMENT THERE WAS A JUSTIFICATION FOR RESORTING TO VIOLENCE, NOW, 10
YEARS LATER, THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION AT ALL AND THE MOMENT HAS COME
FOR BEGINNING A NORMAL LIFE."

   ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO MALES
AMONG THESE REFUGEES IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE LINKS WITH THE
GUERRILLAS.

   ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT FIND MEN OF OVER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THERE WERE
MANY PREGNANT WOMEN," MERINO TOLD THE PRESS.

   THE GOVERNMENT SELECTED SETTLEMENT AREAS FOR THE REPATRIATED, WHERE
IT WILL GIVE THEM MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND A FUNCTIONING
INFRASTRUCTURE.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE REFUGEES HAVE ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO
THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN, IN WAR-TORN AREAS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF
CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS, OR IN LA UNION
DEPARTMENT.

   "TO SEND THEM THERE," MERINO SAID, "WOULD BE TO CONDEMN THEM TO
PERMANENT UNDERDEVELOPMENT.  THEY WANT TO RETURN TO PLACES THAT DO NOT
PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR FOR A NORMAL LIFE."

   THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS, WHICH CLAIMS TO
REPRESENT THE REFUGEES, HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF WANTING TO SEND
THE REPATRIATED TO "CONCENTRATION CAMPS GUARDED BY THE ARMED FORCES."

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 5 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER
SHARED BY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA IS TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE CAUSE
OF CONCERN FOR THE CARACAS GOVERNMENT.  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING ORDERED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IS VIEWED BY LOCAL COMMENTATORS
AS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO VENEZUELA DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO COLOMBIA,
WITH WHOM VENEZUELA SHARES OVER 2,000 KM.

   THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENTS.  ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE
RAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,
SMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
CRIMINALS.  THE WAR DECLARED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THE DRUG
CHIEFTAINS, AND PERHAPS SOME DRUG KINGPINS, MAY SEEK REFUGE IN
VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WARNED THAT IF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER THEIR INDUSTRIES TO VENEZUELA THEY
WILL HAVE TO "FACE VENEZUELAN JUSTICE, AND CERTAINLY EXTRADITION
TRIALS." THE STATES OF ZULIA, TACHIRA, AND APURE --IN WESTERN
VENEZUELA -- BORDER COLOMBIAN TERRITORY AND HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF
DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS MANY TIMES.  IN THE PAST FEW DAYS
VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE MAIN BORDER
POSTS BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING TO
VENEZUELA.

   GOVERNOR OF ZULIA STATE ISMAEL ORDAZ CONFIRMED TO NEWSMEN THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED CONTROL AND VIGILANCE MEASURES AT THE
BORDER WITH COLOMBIA.  HE NOTED THERE IS BROAD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE
VENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   DURING A RADIO PROGRAM ON MONDAY, 4 SEPTEMBER, JOURNALIST JOSE
VICENTE RANGEL, FORMER MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, MAINTAINED THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS TIME THAT DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ENTERED A
LONG TIME AGO.  RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A
BRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION.  FURTHERMORE, HE
SAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED
RESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE
VENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE.  MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID,
DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME
5 BILLION BOLIVARES (SOME $135 MILLION) IN PROPAGANDA.  THIS FIGURE IS
EXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW,
THE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES ($2.7 MILLION) FOR
THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS.

   RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY
ADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS.  HOWEVER, WHILE
COLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE
ECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS
IN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF
ADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY
COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE
NORTH.  IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS
AND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE
IDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN
IDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE
STATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND
PROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO
ELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.

   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD
THEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.

   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
THAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR
STATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE
UNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.

   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT
PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO
CALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR
MOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL
BASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.

   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE
STRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE
VIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO
RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE
INTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
THESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.

   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY
ADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE
POLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES
COMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.

   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER
-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT
THE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES
OF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.

   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY
SERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS
SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.

   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH
COUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF
CONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE
THAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE
NEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.

   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH
MARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.
DRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN
COLOMBIA.

   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE
SHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,
WE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE
DEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.

   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT
TOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.

   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT
INVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,
AND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.

   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL
TREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.

   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND
UNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT
MUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT
IS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.

   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD
STRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR
NATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR
FAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST
COLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE
NATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  WE CAME TO DEFEND
IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT.  WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND
THE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT.  WE ARE HERE TO
REITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED
BEHIND 28 YEARS AGO.

   I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. [APPLAUSE]

   MEDELLIN, 5 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] A RADIO STATION NEWSMAN HAS
REPORTED THAT AN ALLEGED SPOKESMAN FOR "THE EXTRADITABLES," A GROUP
THAT CLAIMS TO BE LINKED TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A RESTAURANT TODAY AND A 5 SEPTEMBER
SHARPSHOOTER ATTACK AT THE LOCAL AIRPORT.

   A NEWSMAN FROM RADIO CARACOL OF MEDELLIN REPORTED RECEIVING A
TELEPHONE CALL FROM A MEMBER OF THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMING
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BURNING OF A COUNTRYSIDE RESTRAURANT. THE
CALLER JUSTIFIED THIS ACTION BY SAYING THAT THE RESTARANTS' OWNERS
PAID HOMAGE TO A MILITARY LEADER.

   MEDELLIN, WHICH IS THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' TRADING HEADQUARTERS IN
COLOMBIA, WAS HIT BY A WAVE OF THREATS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING
BUT FALSE ALARMS THAT NEVERTHELESS PROMPTED THE POLICE TO CONSTANTLY
PATROL THE CITY AND EVACUATE SHOPPING CENTERS IN SEARCH OF NONEXISTENT
BOMBS.

   WORKERS SAID THAT THE RESTAURANT, WHOSE OWNER WAS A FOLLOWER OF
RECENTLY ASSASSINATED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS
TORCHED BY RIFLE-TOTING YOUTHS.

   THEY LOCKED FOUR WORKERS IN AN OFFICE UNTIL THE FIRE STARTED.  THE
RESTAURANT SUFFERED 20 MILLION PESOS ($50,000) IN LOSES.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ATTACK
ON 5 SEPTEMBER IN WHICH A MAN DRESSED IN COMBAT GEAR FIRED AN
AUTOMATIC RIFLE AT INDUSTRIALISTS AND BUSINESSMEN AT THE MEDELLIN
AIRPORT.

   THE SHARPSHOOTER, WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICEMEN, MANAGED TO KILL 1
PERSON AND WOUND 12 OTHERS.  THE ANONYMOUS CALLER GAVE NO EXPLANATION
FOR THE ATTACK, A CARACOL NEWSMAN TOLD REUTER.

   TWO WEEKS AGO THE EXTRADITABLES DECLARED "TOTAL WAR" AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AFTER HE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO
REPRESS THE DRUG BARONS IN WHICH 11,000 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED AND
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE
CONFISCATED.

   BOGOTA, 6 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE REPORTED TODAY THAT
U.S. JOURNALIST BERNARDETTE PARDO, WHO WAS SENT TO COLOMBIA BY THE
SPANISH-SPEAKING UNIVISION TELEVISION NETWORK TO COVER THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT'S "WAR" AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS INJURED LAST NIGHT
DURING AN ATTACK IN MEDELLILN.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT PARDO WAS IN A RESTAURANT IN MEDELLIN
ACCOMPANIED BY CAMERAMAN CARLOS CORRALES AND COLOMBIAN MOVIE ACTOR
JORGE SAENZ WHEN A MEDIUM-INTENSITY BOMB EXPLODED IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT.

   PARDO, OF CUBAN ORIGIN, SUFFERED FRACTURES IN HER CLAVICLE AND
RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE AND WOUNDS IN HER NECK.  SHE IS CURRENTLY AT A
HOSPITAL IN MEDELLIN.  CORRALES WAS INJURED BY SPLINTERS IN VARIOUS
PARTS OF HIS BODY.

   THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK WAS APPARENTLY CARRIED OUT BY A
COUPLE THAT WAS SITTING AT A TABLE CLOSE TO THE JOURNALISTS.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, A WOMAN WENT TO THE RESTROOM, THEN LEFT IN A
HURRY FOLLOWED BY THE MAN, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING HER, SHORTLY BEFORE
THE EXPLOSION.

   ON THE NIGHT OF 3 SEPTEMBER UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED TWO
BOMBS IN A PARKING LOT AND GARDEN OF A MEDELLIN HOTEL WHERE SEVERAL
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE STAYING.  THE JOURNALISTS ARRIVED IN COLOMBIA
A FEW DAYS AGO TO COVER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THAT INCIDENT, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE LARGEST DRUG-TRAFFICKING RING IN THE WORLD, HAD
DECLARED AN ALL-OUT "WAR" AGAINST FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO REMAIN
COLOMBIA.

   LIKEWISE, COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS WERE THREATENED A FEW DAYS AFTER
THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE BEGAN, IN REPRISAL FOR THE HARD BLOWS DEALT
TO THE DRUG CARTEL, IN THE PAST 3 WEEKS.

   IN A STATEMENT FOR A FRENCH NEWSPAPER, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL'S MAIN "CAPO" SAID THAT JOURNALISTS AND JUDGES "WILL
PAY THE CONSEQUENCES" OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUGGLE, WHICH HAS RESULTED
IN HUNDREDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARRESTED AND NUMEROUS PROPERTIES OWNED
BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS CONFISCATED.

   THE ATTACK AGAINST THE UNIVISION JOURNALISTS OCCURRED
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE POLICE IN ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT -- THE CAPITAL OF WHICH IS MEDELLIN -- OF THE ARREST OF
FOUR DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHOSE EXTRADITION MAY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY THE
UNITED STATES.

   THE NAMES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE NOT DISCLOSED TO THE PRESS.
HOWEVER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THEIR ARREST TOOK PLACE DURING INTENSIVE
OPERATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THIS CITY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AS
A RESULT OF WHICH 21 MERCENARIES OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAVE FALLEN.

   MEMBERS OF THE SAME NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION DETONATED
TWO BOMBS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SET A RESTAURANT ON FIRE IN
MEDELLIN, POLICE SPOKESMEN REPORTED.

USE DRUGS.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT $8 BILLION HAS BEEN ALLOTED FOR
THIS PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS.  THE
MEASURES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED.  HOWEVER, THE BUSH PLAN BRINGS HOPE IN
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG USAGE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] THIS IS A COCAINE BY-PRODUCT CALLED CRACK
WHICH WAS CONFISCATED A FEW DAYS AGO BY POLICEMEN AT A PARK IN FRONT

CANDY, BUT THIS IS TURNING OUR CITIES INTO BATTLEFIELDS AND IS KILLING
OUR CHILDREN. [END RECORDING]

   THIS IS HOW PRESIDENT BUSH BEGAN HIS SPEECH, IN WHICH HE DELIVERED
HIS PLAN TO U.S. CITIZENS ON FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE HUGE
NUMBER OF DRUG USERS MADE THE GOVERNMENT INCREASE THE $2 BILLION
BUDGET LAST YEAR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART, IN 1985 THE
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT 23 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS WERE USING DRUGS ON
A CASUAL BASIS; THAT IS, AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE PAST MONTH.  LAST
YEAR, THIS FIGURE DROPPED BY OVER 1/3, WHICH MEANS THAT 9 MILLION U.S.
CITIZENS HAVE CEASED BEING OCCASIONAL DRUG USERS.  ALTHOUGH THE
OVERALL COCAINE USAGE HAS DROPPED, THE FREQUENT USE OF COCAINE HAS
ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  THESE ARE THE CASUAL COCAINE
USERS, THOSE WHO CONSUME CRACK, AND WHO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND
URGENT PROBLEM. [END RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADVISERS SAID THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF THE
DIFFICULTIES OF THE PLAN, HOWEVER HE BELIEVES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS.

   THE BOGOTA NEWSPAPERS DEDICATED THEIR MAIN HEADLINES THIS MORNING
TO THE U.S.  PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.  IN GENERAL THEY COMPARED HIS SPEECH
TO A DECLARATION OF WAR: "BUSH WAGES WAR (EL ESPECTADOR), "BUSH
DECLARES WAR" (EL SIGLO), "8 BILLION AGAINST DRUGS" (EL TIEMPO).

   THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT DEDICATE ANY EDITORIAL TO BUSH'S SPEECH, BUT
LIMITED THEMSELVES TO PUBLISHING EXCERPTS OF HIS SPEECH, TAKING
SPECIAL NOTE OF THE 5-YEAR $2 BILLION AID PLAN FOR COLOMBIA, PERU, AND

REVOKED A CONTROVERSIAL DECREE, ISSUED 24 HOURS BEFORE, THAT EMPOWERED
THE MILITARY TO TAKE OVER THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN AREAS SCOURGED BY THE

THE JUDGES HANDLING DRUG TRAFFICKING CASES TO MILITARY BASES, ATTORNEY
GENERAL ALFONSO GOMEZ MENDEZ TOLD REUTER.

WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY AN "UNPOPULAR" MEASURE.

   ASKED WHEN THE JUDGES WOULD BE TAKEN TO MILITARY BASES, ATTORNEY

ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE, WERE USED BY THE MAFIA TO TRAIN
RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.

   ACCORDING TO SECRET POLICE INVESTIGATIONS, THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS

   NAMED THE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE FOR DRUG CONTROL, IT WAS
HELD AUG 29-31 HERE, AND REPRESENTATIVES PRAISED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE REPRISAL AGAINST DRUG LORDS AND THEIR MAFIAS.

   ARGENTINA, CHILE, COLOMBIA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA PERU, COSTA

BY DISPLACED COLOMBIAN DRUG DEALERS.

ENORMOUS C-130'S.  HERE, MAFIA WARLORDS OPENLY THREATENED TO CARRY OUT
THEIR TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND KILLINGS "IN BROAD DAYLIGHT TO SHOW WE

   MEXICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ENRIQUE ALVAREZ DEL CASTILLO CONGRATULATED
THOSE IN ATTENDANCE AND OFFERED THE EXPERIENCE MEXICO HAD ACQUIRED
DURING 10 YEARS OF AN AGGRESSIVE DRUG WAR.

   BESIDES MORAL SUPPORT, MEXICO UNDERLINED THE NEED FOR COORDINATED
EFFORTS IN LAWS AND ACTION.  FIRST, THAT COURTS HAND DOWN STIFF
SENTENCES; SECOND, THAT NO BAIL BE GRANTED IN DRUG TRIALS; THIRD, THAT
ALL PROPERTY DERIVED FROM DRUG PROFITS BE CONFISCATED AND LEGALLY USED
TO DEFRAY COSTS OF COMBATTING DRUG TRAFFIC.

   IN THE FINAL RESOLUTION, THE NINE NATIONS ACCEPTED TO EXCHANGE
INFORMATION, COORDINATE ALL ACTIVITIES JOINTLY - BUT CARRY THEM OUT
SEPARATELY BECAUSE OF THE DELICATE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY -
COMPLETE COOPERATION IN ALL AREAS AND TO REGARD THE DRUG EFFORT AS AN

   VIENNA (AUSTRIA), 12 SEP 89 (DER STANDARD) -- [TEXT] "NONE OF US
WANTED THE WAR.  NOW THAT WE STARTED IT, WE HAVE TO WIN IT." WITH
THESE WORDS MARGARET J.  ANSTEE, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE UN OFFICE IN
VIENNA, OPENED THE SECOND INTERREGIONAL MEETING OF THE HEADS OF
NATIONAL DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (HONLEA) IN VIENNA ON MONDAY
[11 SEPTEMBER].

   THE CONFERENCE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO LAST UNTIL FRIDAY, FOCUSES ON
INTERNATIONAL TRENDS AND STRATEGIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ILLEGAL
NARCOTICS TRADE, AS WELL AS THE DRAWING UP OF A FIRST "POSITIVE
BALANCE SHEET" SINCE THE VIENNA HONLEA MEETING OF 1986, AND THE 1987
INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONFERENCE.  SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PUT ON
THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA AND ALL OTHER PARTS OF LATIN
AMERICA.

   "WITH ITS FIGHT AGAINST THE ILLEGAL NARCOTICS TRADE, COLOMBIA HAS
ASSURED ITSELF A PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR AGAINST DRUGS,"
ANSTEE SAID.  THIS "BATTLE" IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM OF AN
INDIVIDUAL STATE, BUT A CONCERN OF THE WHOLE WORLD, SHE SAID.

   "EVEN THE MURDER OF A COLOMBIAN JUDGE, POLICE HEAD, OR POLITICIAN,
WHO WAS TRYING HARD TO BRING DRUG DEALERS TO COURT, IS NOT MERELY AN
ATTACK AGAINST HIS PERSON AND HIS FAMILY, NOT ONLY ONE AGAINST THE
LAWS AND THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO AN ASSAULT AGAINST US ALL, THE UN
OFFICIAL SAID.

   SHE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS NOW PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT
THE ANTI-DRUG CONVENTION, WHICH WAS CONCLUDED IN 1988 AND, UP TO NOW,
SIGNED BY 71 STATES, TRANSLATES INTO CONCRETE STEPS AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE -- EVEN BEFORE THE PROTRACTED RATIFICATION PROCEDURE IS
CONCLUDED.

   JAVIER CUELLO TREJO, THE MEXICAN WHO WAS ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE
CONFERENCE BY ACCLAMATION, SAID: "THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS IS NOT
ONLY OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE FOR LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE
SURVIVAL OF THE ENTIRE MANKIND.  WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION, WE AND OUR
PEOPLES ARE VICTIMS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE FROM SUPPRESSING OTHER
PEOPLE."

   THE SITUATION IN THE SPHERES OF THE NARCOTICS TRADE AND CONSUMPTION
HAS DRAMATICALLY DETERIORATED EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD DURING THE PAST
3 YEARS, CHRISTOPH HARSDORF, HEAD OF THE FRG DELEGATION, NOTED AT THE
PERIPHERY OF THE UN CONFERENCE.

COMMISSION OF GUATEMALA [CDH] CHARGED HERE TODAY THE "SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY" OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE SECRET SERVICE OF
THE ARMY (G-2) IN THE DEATH OF FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WHOSE
BRUTALLY MUTILATED BODIES WERE FOUND ON 10 SEPTEMBER IN A GUATEMALA
CITY SUBURB.

   THE FINDING COMES IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, KILLINGS,
AND DYNAMITE ATTACKS WHICH WERE UNLEASHED STARTING IN MID-JULY AND
WHICH HAS SHOCKED THE GUATEMALANS.  THE WHEREABOUTS OF SEVEN OTHER
STUDENTS, KIDNAPPED BY ALLEGED DEATH SQUADS, REMAIN UNKNOWN.  THESE
SQUADS HAVE BEEN ON THE RAMPAGE SINCE 23 AUGUST.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE TO VARIOUS POLITICAL, TRADE UNION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ORGANIZATIONS, THE CHDG BRANCH IN SAN JOSE REQUESTED "URGENTLY" THE
SENDING OF MESSAGES TO THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSIES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARMY
CONDEMNING THE "IMPUNITY" OF THE DEATH SQUADS.

   TWO OF THE MURDERED VICTIMS -- SILVIA AZURDIA AND HER HUSBAND
VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ -- WERE ABDUCTED BY EIGHT MEN IN CIVILIAN
CLOTHES BEFORE WITNESSES WHO EVEN PROVIDED THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE
LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS OF THE TWO VEHICLES USED BY THE KIDNAPPERS.

   THE CDHG EXPRESSED "DEEP CONCERN OVER THESE EVENTS WHICH REFLECT A
TOTAL LACK OF POLITICAL WILLINGNESS" ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO
END REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE.

   ACCORDING TO HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, GUATEMALA HOLDS A RECORD
IN THE HEMISPHERE, 40,000 MISSING PERSONS IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.

   ON 11 SEPTEMBER, IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT THE MUTILATED AND
BULLET-RIDDLED BODIES OF THREE MORE UNIDENTIFIED GUATEMALANS WERE
FOUND.

   ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS KILLED LAST WEEKEND WAS CARLOS
HUMBERTO CABRERA, WHO HAD RETURNED TO GUATEMALA AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
EXILE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GUARANTEES ANNOUNCED BY THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO REPATRIATE HOME ANY GUATEMALAN WHO WISHED TO
COME, THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED TODAY.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, HUMBERTO CHUTA, A BROTHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS,
STATED THAT "IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LIVE ALL OUR LIVES AS IF WE
WERE DOGS."  HE REQUESTED CEREZO "DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO
INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION, IF HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
HAPPENED."

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] SINCE A MINE
IS A WEAPON OF A MILITARY NATURE AND SINCE ITS USE HAS INCREASED IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS THROUGHOUT VARIOUS UNPOPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY
WHERE MINE FIELDS HAVE BEEN PLANTED, THE SWEEPING OF THIS TYPE OF
WEAPON WILL NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE GRADUALLY FOR TECHNICAL AND
OPERATIONAL REASONS.  THEREFORE, THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED TO SUSPEND
THEIR USE WILL BE:

   1.  END THE MANUFACTURING OF BOOBY TRAPS.

   2.  END TO THE PLANTING OF NEW MINE FIELDS.

   3.  IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF ALL MINES PLANTED IN AREAS OF HIGH RISK
FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF THOSE AREAS THAT, FOR
TECHNICAL REASONS -- LOSS OF MAP OF THE MINED AREAS -- CANNOT BE SWEPT
IMMEDIATELY.

   4.  GRADUAL SWEEPING OF THE MINE FIELDS LOCATED IN AREAS OF LOW
RISK FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND MARKING OF SITES WHERE, FOR
TECHNICAL REASONS, THE MINES CANNOT BE REMOVED.

   5.  THIS ORDER DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLAYMORE MINES USED IN THE
AMBUSH OF SOLDIERS.

   WE WILL COORDINATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MEASURES WITH
HUMANITARIAN AID ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.

   LIKEWISE, WE EXPECT THE ARMY TO SWEEP THE MINE FIELDS THAT SURROUND
THE GARRISONS AND FIXED MILITARY POSTS LOCATED IN HEAVILY POPULATED
AREAS.  THESE MINES ARE CONSTANTLY HARMING THE PEOPLE OR THEIR
DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

   LIKEWISE, THE ARMY MUST CEASE ALL BOMBING AND SHELLING OF CIVILIAN

GOVERNMENT.

   HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT THEY WILL BE STUDIED TODAY AND TOMORROW
DURING MEETINGS HERE BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION.

   THE NINE POINTS REVEALED BY THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ARE:

   1. BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION
PARTIES.

   2. JOINT ACCORD ON MEASURES TO ENSURE THE END OF ALL FORMS OF
REPRESSION AND FULL RESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES THAT WOULD BE
VERIFIED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND OAS.

   3. PACT TO CONTINUE HONEST JUDICIAL PROCESS GUARANTEEING THE
DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF MONSIGNOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO
AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN DEATH SQUADS.

   4. ACCORD TO DISSOLVE THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT CAUSES POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL CONFRONTATION THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF REFORMS PROMOTED
BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO PRECEDED CRISTIANI.

   5. PACT ON MEASURES FOR SELF-MONITORING AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF
THE ARMED FORCES.

   6. COMMITMENT FROM THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL
SUBMIT ACCORDS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT COULD EMERGE FROM
THIS DIALOGUE THAT BEGINS TODAY FOR APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY.

   7. ACCORD TO ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS TO BRING
ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ACCELERATE AN
END TO THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.

   8. MUTUAL GUARANTEES FOR THE OPERATION AND SETTLEMENT OF FORCES
THAT WILL GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR A CEASE-FIRE WITHOUT THIS IMPLYING A
VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   9. INITIAL STEPS FOR THE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN INTO SALVADORAN
POLITICAL LIFE.

   AS FOR THIS LATTER POINT, HANDAL SAID THAT THE FMLN MUST BECOME A
POLITICAL PARTY BY REGISTERING ITS FOLLOWERS AND ESTABLISHING A
RAPPORT WITH THE MEDIA.

   HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS GUERRILLA GROUP HAS ESTABLISHED A "NO
LATER THAN 15 NOVEMBER" DEADLINE TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE ACCORD.

OPTIMISM, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS OPENED A
DIALOGUE IN MEXICO CITY TODAY TO ESTABLISH PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WITH
A SPECTACULAR PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE INSURGENTS THAT THEY ARE
PREPARED TO DECLARE A DEFINITIVE CEASE-FIRE AND BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   THIS PROPOSAL -- WHICH ENTAILS A DECISION TO LAY DOWN ARMS IF
CERTAIN PRIOR CONDITIONS ARE MET -- DID NOT MEET WITH A MATCHING
PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN A
MODERN BUILDING BELONGING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN A
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF MEXICO CITY.

   COMMANDER MIGUEL SAENZ OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) SAID DURING A RECESS THAT "THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMISSION
DID NOT BRING ANY SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL."

   ALL THE MEN WERE WEARING COATS AND TIE, WHEREAS THE FEMALE FMLN
COMMANDERS WERE IN VERY FORMAL ATTIRE.

   THE MEETING IS TAKING PLACE IN A 10-SQUARE-METER ROOM IN WHICH THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AND GUERRILLAS SIT FACE-TO-FACE, WITH THE
MODERATORS AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.  THE ROOM HAS AN ANNEX TO WHICH
THE NEGOTIATORS WITHDRAW DURING RECESSES TO ANALYZE THE OTHER SIDE'S
POSITIONS.

   MSGR ROMEO TOBAR ASTORGA, WHO IS THE MODERATOR OF THE MEETING AND
PRESIDENT OF THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, HAD ASSERTED BEFORE
THE START OF THE MEETING THAT HE COULD SEE A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH SIDES
"TO END A WAR THAT HAS CAUSED MANY VICTIMS."

   "ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A MARXIST, BECAUSE THAT IDEOLOGY IS ATHEISTIC
AND MATERIALISTIC, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS URGENT THAT THIS DIALOGUE
LEAD TO THE PEACE WE LONG FOR," HE ALSO SAID.

   SAENZ, WHO ALSO SOUNDED OPTIMISTIC BUT CAUTIOUS, SAID DURING A
BRIEF TALK WITH NEWSMEN THAT PROCEDURES FOR THIS AND SUBSEQUENT
MEETINGS ARE UNDER DISCUSSION, AND TIMETABLES, STAGES, AND SITES
SHOULD RESULT FROM THEM.

   SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, OSCAR SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE
JUSTICE MINISTER AND ONE OF THE OFFICIAL DELEGATES, ASSERTED THAT
"THERE IS UTMOST WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE" ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

   IN ADDITION TO SANTAMARIA, THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION ARE PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN MARTINEZ, POET DAVID ESCOBAR,
AND ADVISERS HECTOR CONTRERAS AND ABELARDO TORRES.  TOBAR ASTORGA IS
ACCOMPANIED BY MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   BESIDES SAENZ, THE FMLN IS REPRESENTED BY COMMANDERS SHAFIK HANDAL,
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ, MERCEDES LETONA, MARIO
ROJAS, AND DANIEL LOPEZ.

   AT 1045 (1645 GMT), 1 HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, THE FMLN
RELEASED ITS PROPOSAL TO THE PRESS, WHICH INCLUDES A CEASE-FIRE ON 15
NOVEMBER, A DEFINITIVE END TO THE HOSTILITIES ON 31 JANUARY, AND THE
INCORPORATION OF ITS LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS INTO THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL LIFE THROUGH A POLITICAL PARTY.

   THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED BY THE FMLN INCLUDE REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEMS, AN END TO ALL MANNER OF REPRESSION, THE PURGING
 AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, THE FULL EXERCISE OF
FREEDOMS (VERIFIED BY THE UN AND THE OAS), THE REORGANIZATION OF THE
ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE HOLDING OF THE 1991 LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE
ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   THE FIRST STEP THE FMLN WOULD TAKE ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS IN PLACE
WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF ITS MILITANTS AND ITS MEDIA. "THIS
STEP INVOLVES RISKS, BUT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THEM," THE GUERRILLA
DELEGATES SAID.

   THE TALKS WERE CONTINUING EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT ACCESS TO
THE PRESS AND AMID A DISCREET SECURITY MEASURE ESTABLISHED BY THE
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT -- JUST A COUPLE OF MEN WITH "WALKIE-TALKIES" AND
DISGUISED WEAPONS.

   SAVE FOR AN UNFORESEEN OBSTACLE, THE MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO
CONTINUE TOMORROW, THURSDAY.

RESTREPO] [TEXT] NICARAGUA WILL HOLD GENERAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR IN
FEBRUARY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, HAS
BEEN BRAZENLY MANEUVERING SO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO
THE EMPIRE'S INTERESTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  BESIDES ITS INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MAINTAINED A TEAM DEDICATED TO
ELECTORAL TERRORISM TO SERVE THE OPPOSITION SECTORS IN HANDLING
CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA, DISTRIBUTING MONEY, AND FALSIFYING AND STEALING
TALLY SHEETS.  THESE TERRORIST AGENTS BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN
PANAMA, WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, CAN BE APPLIED
TO NICARAGUA.

   AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD PROCLAIMING U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE
FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, PRESIDENT BUSH IS "CONSIDERING"
MAKING AN INITIAL DONATION OF $3 MILLION TO THE OPPOSITION.  THE STATE
DEPARTMENT HAS ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT "PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEEN
CONSIDERING RESORTING TO THE CIA TO CONTROL THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS
AND TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS."

   ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOT DISCARDING THE
USE OF THE SO-CALLED "CONTRAS" TO HARASS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
FROM HONDURAS TO CREATE CHAOS DURING THE ELECTIONS, GIVING THE UNITED
STATES AN EXCUSE TO OCCUPY NICARAGUA MILITARILY."

   ACCORDING TO CONTINENTAL OBSERVERS, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS DECIDED
"THAT THE NICARGUAN ELECTIONS MUST BE WON BY THE UNITED STATES."

   VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO'S CANDIDACY IS A SIMPLE COVER-UP, THE SAME AS
THE CANDIDACY LAUNCHED BY THE SECTORS THAT OPPOSE OUR COUNTRY'S
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.

   ANY ANALYST CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO
TAKE ITS HANDS OFF CENTRAL AMERICA."  THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON IS
SEEKING FORMULAS TO SEND MONEY TO THE OPPOSITION, NOT ONLY LEGALLY,
BUT ALSO THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS AND PHANTOM ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH,
UNDER THE EXCUSE OF "DEFENDING DEMOCRACY" OPERATE IN AFGHANISTAN,
ANGOLA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST; SUPPORT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA; AND
ENGAGE IN OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

   PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT "THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA
ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO THE MARXIST GOVERNMENT IN
NICARAGUA HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA."  ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS, "THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT IS READY TO SPEND AT LEAST $200 MILLION TO WIN THE
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA."  IT IS ALSO READY TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST
THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, THEREBY INCREASING DESPERATION, BECAUSE IT
BELIEVES THAT THE PEOPLE'S DESPERATION, MISERY, HUNGER, AND DEATHS
MIGHT PRODUCE A REBELLION FAVORABLE TO U.S. INTERESTS."

ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PROVIDE ALTERED GUATEMALAN PASSPORTS TO
COURIERS WHO BRING TO GUATEMALA COCAINE THAT IS LATER TAKEN TO THE
UNITED STATES.

   ARTURO CHUR DEL CID, DIRECTOR OF THE GUATEMALAN IMMIGRATION
DEPARTMENT, HAS REPORTED THAT IN BOGOTA, DURING A RECENT MILITARY
OPERATION AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE POLICE SEIZED THREE GUATEMALAN
PASSPORTS.

   THE SEIZED DOCUMENTS WERE ISSUED TO GERMAN ALBERTO MARIN RAMOS,
CESAR AUGUSTO SALDANA, AND IRMA YOLANDA SAMAYOA VELIZ.

   CHUR DEL CID SAID: "THE PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED BY GUATEMALA'S
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT.  THEY COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND TAKEN TO
COLOMBIA WHERE THEY WERE FOUND WITH DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS, READY FOR
USE BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS."

   THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT THE DOCUMENTS WERE CAREFULLY ANALYZED AND
THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT DATA ON THE PASSPORTS WAS ALTERED
AND THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT THOSE OF THE TRUE OWNERS OF THE
DOCUMENTS.

   AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, ANYONE WITH A COLOMBIAN VISA WANTING
TO COME TO GUATEMALA MUST FIRST CONSULT WITH AUTHORITIES TO SEE IF
THIS IS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE TO KEEP THE COUNTRY
FROM SERVING AS A SPRINGBOARD OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

BUT HAVE NOT BROKEN OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS, AN M-19 SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED
TODAY.

   RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE AFFAIRS,
ANNOUNCED THAT AFTER THE TALKS ON 13 SEPTEMBER IN SANTO DOMINGO (400
KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA), THE AGREEMENT FOR THE M-19 TO DEMOBILIZE AND
RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE WAS POSTPONED.

   IN STATEMENTS BY TELEPHONE TO REUTER FROM SANTO DOMINGO, HIPOLITO
BLANCO, A RANKING M-19 SPOKESMAN, SAID "WE HOPE TO HOLD ANOTHER
MEETING SOON; THE TOPICS WE MUST AGREE UPON ARE COMPLEX AND WE MUST
TAKE TIME TO ANALYZE THEM."

   BLANCO POINTED OUT THAT "YESTERDAY'S MEETING WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
CORDIALITY," BUT "THE MECHANISMS TO BROADEN DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY
AND DEMOBILIZATION" ARE ISSUES THAT MUST STILL BE STUDIED IN-DEPTH.

   BLANCO ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS BEING CONSIDERED IS A
PARDON FOR M-19 MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
VIOLENT OCCUPATION OF THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985, WHEN
APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   THE M-19 IS ONE OF SIX ACTIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN COLOMBIA AND THE
ONE THAT HAS MADE THE GREATEST PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.

   THE GROUP IS NATIONALIST IN IDEOLOGY.  IT HAS 1,000 ARMED MEN, IS
BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SPECTACULAR OPERATIONS, AND MAY WELL BECOME THE
FIRST COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS INDEFINITELY.

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT ON 17 MARCH
AND OPENED TALKS IN MAY WITH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS CALLED
"WORKING TABLES."

   THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE "WORKING TABLES" -- WHICH ENDED THE
FIRST WEEK OF JULY -- WILL BE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY
IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, LAWS,
OR DECREES.

   SOME OF THE REFORMS DEAL WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY GROUPS
IN CONGRESS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   OTHER GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH THE
GOVERNMENT THIS MONTH TO SPEED UP THE PEACEMAKING PROCESS.

   THE ONLY GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS STAYED AWAY FROM THE PEACE
PROCESS IS THE CASTROITE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, WHICH CEASED
BOMBING PIPELINES ON 25 AUGUST, BUT HAS CONTINUED ITS GUERRILLA
OPERATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY ESTIMATES, THE SIX INSURGENT GROUPS IN
COLOMBIA HAVE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 7,000 ARMED MEN.

STATES HAS REQUESTED THAT THESE MEN BE EXTRADITED TO RESPOND TO
CHARGES AGAINST THEM IN THAT COUNTRY.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT PELAEZ ROLDAN WAS ARRESTED IN BOGOTA AND IS
CHARGED BY A COURT IN DETROIT OF CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE COCAINE IN
THE UNITED STATES.

   BUENO DELGADO WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE ON SAN ANDRES ISLAND IN
THE CARIBBEAN AND WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO BOGOTA AND HANDED
OVER TO JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES.

   ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, SPOKESMEN SAID THAT
REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OF THE SUSPECTED DRUG LORD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
FROM FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA COURTS, WHERE HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
SMUGGLING AT LEAST 5,000 KG OF COCAINE INTO THE UNITED STATES AND
LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

   LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT EXTRADITED THE ALLEDGED
"FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES.  HE IS
EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO AND HAS TO ANSWER CHARGES IN AN ATLANTA COURT
OF "LAUNDERING" MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION THROUGH A PANAMANIAN BANK.

   THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS HAVE THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR
EACH COLOMBIAN EXTRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, AND THIS THREAT HAS THE
WHOLE COUNTRY TENSE AND ANXIOUS.

   THERE ARE RUMORS CIRCULATING IN SEVERAL CITIES THAT NARCOCRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PREPARING AN OPERATION CALLED "BLACK SEPTEMBER" THAT
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT WEEKEND BY POISONING WATER SUPPLIES AND
ATTACKING COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND NIGHT CLUBS.

MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] TODAY, 14 SEPTEMBER, THE
CHIEFS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARCE BATTALION STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS
BROKEN THE UNILATERAL TRUCE.  THE ARCE BATTALION CHIEFS SAID THAT
CLASHES TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF PERQUIN AND ADMITTED THAT TWO
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES.

   IN REGARD TO THOSE STATEMENTS, WE CONSIDER THAT:

   1. FOR 7 YEARS AND AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM THAT AREA, THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES DO NOT HAVE FIXED POSITIONS NORTH OF MORAZAN
DEPARTMENT.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS
HAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES.  THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED
BY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED
IN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES.

   2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION
[WORD INDISTINCT] BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE,
BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG
WHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES.

   3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE
ESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE
REGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE
EVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF
BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 14 SEP 89 (RADIO RELOJ NETWORK) -- [TEXT] THE
REBELS' DECISION TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ABANDON THE ARMED
STRUGGLE AND MAKE OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FLMN] OF EL SALVADOR A LEGAL PARTY, FAR FROM WEAKENING THE GUERRILLA,
STRENGTHENS ITS REVOLUTIONARY POSITION. A COMMENTARY WRITTEN BY RITA
CEBALLOS FROM PRENSA LATINA NOTES THAT IN ADDITION OF BEING DECISIVE
IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A DRASTIC INTERNAL CHANGE, THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
THE GUERRILLA IS A POLITICAL BLOW TO THE SALVADORAN EXTREME RIGHT.

   PRENSA LATINA ADDS THAT THE DISARMAMENT AND PEACE OFFER GIVES
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI A SITUATION HE HAS TO RESOLVE
IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREA. NO MATTER WHAT THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE IS
DURING THE CONSULTATION SESSIONS BEING HELD IN MEXICO BETWEEN THE
EXTREME RIGHT'S NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE FLMN, THE SALVADORAN REACTIONARIES WILL NOT BENEFIT. THE FLMN SAID
IN THE MEETING IN MEXICO THAT EITHER THE REGIME ACCEPTS THE CONDITIONS
SUGGESTED BY THE GUERRILLA OR PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCES HE
FAVORS A WAR HE CANNOT WIN.

   THE GUERRILLA PROPOSES THE TOTAL CEASE OF HOSTILITIES BEFORE 31
JANUARY, END OF THE REPRESSION, SELF-CLEANING OF THE ARMY, AND THE
RESTRUCTURING OF THE MUNICIPAL AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM, AMONG OTHER
PROPOSALS.  PRENSA LATINA COMMENTS THAT THE SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH THE
GUERRILLA CHIEFS PRESENTED THEIR PROPOSALS AND THEIR CONTENTS LEFT
CRISTIANI'S CABINET AT THE DEFENSIVE AS WELL AS ITS MANEUVERS TO
DISARM THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE AGREEMENT OF ARENA, THE ULTRA-RIGHT
RULING PARTY, TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLA OPENS A POSSIBILITY FOR PEACE
IN EL SALVADOR.  WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) OF COLOMBIA DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE TECA
- VASCONIA OIL PIPELINE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT,
THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE (ECOPETROL) OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION WAS STAGED IN PUERTO BOYACA WHERE THE OIL
PIPELINE WAS DESTROYED AND MUCH ELN PROPAGANDA WAS STREWN.

   ECOPETROL STATED THAT THE ATTACK OCCURRED "DESPITE THE SUBVERSIVE
GROUP'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WILL SUSPEND THIS TYPE OF ACTION TO
FACILITATE THE PUBLIC DEBATE OF OIL POLICY."

   THIS OIL PIPELINE CONNECTS VASCONIA IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY WITH THE LINE THAT GOES TO BARRANCABERMEJA IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA
WHERE ECOPETROL HAS ITS MAIN REFINERY.

   THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WAGING AN ARMED STRUGGLE
FOR 25 YEARS AND IS LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, CLAIMS
THAT THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE HYDROCARBONS AND MINING INDUSTRIES IS A
WAY OF PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM SACKING THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES.

   SINCE JANUARY 1988 WHEN IT BEGAN ITS ATTACKS ON OIL PIPELINES, THE
ELN HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 130 ATTACKS AGAINST THE TECA - VASCONIA
PIPELINE, THE PACIFIC PIPELINE, AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL ARTERY, THE
CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE.

[HERNANDO CORRAL] [TEXT] THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS
FOR NORBERTO HERNANDEZ ROMERO AND RAFAEL RIVERA ALARCON AND CHARGED
THEM WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE MURDER OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS
CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO.  THE SAME JUDGE ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT FOR
JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ AND CHARGED HIM WITH BEING THE
MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME.  THESE THREE PERSONS HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED
AND ARE BEING SOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   LUIS ALFREDO GONZALEZ CHACON, PEDRO ZAMBRANO DELGADO, NORBERTO
MURRILLO CHALARCA, ARMANDO BERNAL ACOSTA, HECTOR MANUEL ZEPEDA
QUINTERO, AND ALBERTO JUBIS HASZVUMB WERE ARRESTED A FEW DAYS AGO IN
BOGOTA AND CHARGED WITH BEING ACCOMPLICES TO THE CRIME.  THE THIRD
CIVIL JUDGE ALSO DECIDED TO RELEASE LUIS FELIPE TORRES, THE MAN WHO
CARRIED A POSTER AND A HAT AT THE MURDER SCENE AND WHO WAS INITIALLY
ACCUSED OF HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT JAIME DE JESUS VALENCIA MARTINEZ, THE
ALLEGED MASTERMIND OF THE CRIME, OFFERED 50 MILLION PESOS TO POLICE
OFFICIALS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF SIX PERSONS WHO HAD
BEEN ARRESTED IN A LUXURY APARTMENT IN BOGOTA.  VALENCIA IS ALSO
CHARGED WITH BEING THE OWNER OF THE MACHINEGUN THAT WAS FOUND IN THE
APARTMENT IN WHICH THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED.

   THE DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A SWORN STATEMENT BY FORMER
MINISTER CARLOS OBANDO VELASCO THAT CERTIFIES THAT HE WAS WITH JUBIS
HAZVUMB ON THE DAY GALAN WAS KILLED.  THE LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM THAT
GALAN SARMIENTO WAS KILLED BY AN UZI SUBMACHINEGUN AND THAT THE ONE
FOUND AT THE APARTMENT WHERE THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED WAS AN
INGRAM.  BALLISTIC TEST RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REVEALED.  THE
DEFENSE LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED THE COURT DECISION, AND NOW THE COURT
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE
IS TO STAND.

   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE FRG EMBASSY IN BOGOTA TODAY
REJECTED A REPORT THAT SOME OF ITS OFFICIALS ARE LINKED TO THE
POWERFUL DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.

   THE REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE GERMAN WEEKLY "WELT AM SONNTAG,"
WHICH BASED ITS INFORMATION ON FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE SOURCES
WHO STATED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION ASSIGNED TO
BOGOTA ARE LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING AND HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE
OPERATIONS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD.

   AN FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN WHO WAS QUESTIONED BY DPA SAID: "WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT A MISSION MEMBER WHO HAS BEEN LINKED TO DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN PUBLICATION, APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION
OBTAINED BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOR THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN
TRANSFERRED FROM BANKS IN COLOMBIA TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN PANAMA
AND LUXEMBOURG.

   LAST WEEK, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS DECLARED "WAR" ON
THE COCAINE GANGS, EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES EDUARDO MARTINEZ
ROMERO, THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  ROMERO
IS ACCUSED OF BEING THE "BRAIN" BEHIND THE CARTEL'S MONEY-LAUNDERING
OPERATIONS.

   AT PRESENT, MARTINEZ ROMERO IS BEING CHARGED AT AN ATLANTA COURT
FOR ALLEGEDLY LAUNDERING MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION IN THE BANCO DE
OCCIDENTE DE PANAMA.  ACCORDING TO "WELT AM SONNTAG," THIS BANK SENT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FUNDS TO THE DEUTSCH-SUEDAMERIKANISCHE BANK.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKER'S EXTRADITION HAS CAUSED TENSION AND ANXIETY IN
COLOMBIA BECAUSE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHEREIN THEY
THREATENED TO KILL 10 JUDGES FOR EACH COLOMBIAN SENT TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY.

   THE FRG EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT THE ALLEGED LINKS OF EMBASSY
OFFICIALS WITH THE MAFIA "WERE INVENTED BY A NEWS AGENCY -- NOT DPA --
THAT WROTE THE INFORMATION IN BONN."  THE INFORMATION WAS LATER
PUBLISHED BY "WELT AM SONNTAG," WHICH, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, WAS A
NEWSPAPER "THAT WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT."

   SO FAR, THE "WAR" BEING CARRIED OUT BY COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS HAS LED
TO THE CAPTURE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE DRUG CARTEL
AND THE CONFISCATION OF NUMEROUS PROPERTIES BELONGING TO THE "CAPOS"
PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE BIGGEST
MAFIOSOS IN THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON AND BOGOTA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, NO DATE (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE SETTING OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND THE KIDNAPPINGS ARE
AN ATTEMPT BY SOME TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT JUSTIFICATION FOR USING A
STRONG HAND, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID.  THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE
BOMBS AND THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF CANDIDATES IS THE WORK OF
TERRORISTS.  REPORTING THAT THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE
PRESENTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, CEREZO AREVALO URGED CITIZENS TO HELP
IN THE EFFORTS TO CONTROL VIOLENCE.

   [CEREZO] "FIRST, WE NEED THE PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP, WHICH
IMPLIES HAVING THE COURAGE TO PASS ON INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT,
BECAUSE PEOPLE FEAR REPRISALS FROM CRIMINALS.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE NOT
ALL UNITED TO FIGHT CRIME AND TERRORISM, WE GUATEMALANS WILL CERTAINLY
BE AFFECTED SERIOUSLY IN THE FUTURE BY THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE, WHICH
SEEMS TO BE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE
PAST.

   "SECOND, I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOME SECTORS HAVE TURNED TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY REQUESTING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP
REPRESENTATIVES BE SENT HERE, AS IF THE GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT].
PEOPLE ARE AWARE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, YET THEY HOLD THE
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE.  I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TURN TO
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO THIS -- SO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN HELP US CONTROL TERRORISM.

   "THIRD, I MUST RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE PARTIES, THE UNION OF THE
NATIONAL CENTER, HAS ADOPTED A POSITIVE ATTITUDE BY MAKING SUGGESTIONS
TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HOW TO CONTROL CRIME.  WE ARE GOING TO STUDY
THEIR PROPOSALS.  WE BELIEVE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSALS COME FROM AN
OPPOSITION PARTY, WE SHOULD ANALYZE THEM.  WE URGE ALL SECTORS IN
GUATEMALAN SOCIETY NOT TO SIMPLY ADOPT THE EASY ATTITUDE OF ACCUSING
THE GOVERNMENT.  WE SHOULD INSTEAD ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF REJECTING
CRIME."

   REGARDING THE PROPOSALS HE WILL MAKE DURING HIS UPCOMING VISIT TO
THE UN HEARDQUARTERS AND THE RECENT ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA, WHICH HE
SAID ARE AIMED AT DESTROYING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACHIEVED DURING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, CEREZO AREVALO ADDED:

   [CEREZO] "AMONG THE ISSUES WE ARE GOING TO POINT OUT IS THAT, AT
THIS MOMENT, GUATEMALA IS THE TARGET OF AN ATTEMP TO UNDERMINE THE
CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED THE HELP OF
DEMOCRACIES THAT ARE FRIENDS OF GUATEMALA, BUT NOT IN THE CAPACITY OF
JUDGES.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED TOTAL SUPPORT TO CONTROL A DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OFFENSIVE THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY
AND THAT SEEKS TO DESTROY THE REPUBLIC."

   THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THE LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES
WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY SINCE CEREZO WAS SWORN IN LEAVE THE
COUNTRY AGAIN TO DISCREDIT GUATEMALA, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID.

   [CEREZO] "DURING 3 AND 1/2 YEARS OF DEMOCRACY, IN WHICH WE
IMPLEMENTED PLANS AND GUARANTEED THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS, GUATEMALA
BEGAN TO WELCOME ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE: REFUGEES -- GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE
BEEN LIVING IN EXILE FOR YEARS IN MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES; PEOPLE
WHO HAD BEEN THREATENED AND WHO WERE LIVING IN COSTA RICA AND WHO HAVE
RETURNED.  WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THESE PEOPLE WORK BECAUSE, FOR
US, THEY ARE GUATEMALANS WHO HAVE RETURNED.  HOWEVER, WE ARE BEGINNING
TO RECEIVE REPORTS FROM THEM.  THEY HAVE TOLD US THEY ARE BEING
SYSTEMATICALLY THREATENED OVER THE TELEPHONE.  WHO KNOWS WHERE THESE
PEOPLE ARE OR HOW THEY GOT THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBERS?  HOW IS THIS DONE?
THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING THESE FORMER REFUGEES LEAVE THE
COUNTRY TO AGAIN REPORT THAT WE ARE VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS IN
GUATEMALA TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  I WOULD SAY
WE ARE BEING AFFECTED BY TWO TRENDS THAT ARE FIGHTING AGAINST
GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY." [CONTINUED]

COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE [FAC] COMMANDOS AND PILOTS TODAY RECEIVED ORDERS
TO STAND READY TO TAKE OFF, INTERCEPT, CAPTURE, OR SHOOT DOWN
UNIDENTIFIED OR HOSTILE AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER THE NATION'S TERRITORY.
THE GOVERNMENT ADOPTED THESE MEASURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  HERE IS A REPORT BY AMPARO MONTON:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MONTON] THE ORDER WAS ISSUED BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR
FORCE COMMANDS, WHICH ALSO DECIDED TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AND
OTHER WEAPONS ABOARD FAC AIRCRAFT.  ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS
MANUAL SENT TO ALL AIR BASES, ORDERS ARE GIVEN TO CAPTURE, DESTROY, OR
SHOOT DOWN PLANES IN 11 INSTANCES, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: WHEN
PLANES FLY OVER FORBIDDEN OR RESTRICTED AREAS; IN THE EVENT OF
UNAUTHORIZED LANDINGS; WHEN THE [WORD INDISTINCT] DO NOT ESTABLISH
RADIO CONTACT WITH THE INTERCEPTOR PLANE FLYING OVER THEM; WHEN
AIRCRAFT LAND IN PLACES NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS
OFFICE; WHEN THEY LAND ON CLANDESTINE AIRSTRIPS.

   INSTRUCTIONS WERE ALSO ISSUED TO ALL AIR COMMANDS TO KEEP TWO
ARMORED AIRCRAFT ON ALERT AT ALL TIMES EITHER ON THE GROUND OR IN THE
AIR.  THE ONLY EVENT IN WHICH THE SHOOTING DOWN OF A HOSTILE AIRCRAFT
MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED IS WHEN SUCH AN ACTION WOULD ENDANGER INNOCENT
PEOPLE OR OCCUPIED BUILDINGS.

   IN ADDITION, THE FAC COMMAND DIVIDED THE PROCEDURE INTO FOUR
PHASES, NAMELY: DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, INTERCEPTION, AND
DESTRUCTION.  THESE MEASURES WILL APPLY TO ALL SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING
AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING PLANES OF COLOMBIAN OR FOREIGN REGISTRY.  [END

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[VEDENYAPIN] DURING THE LAST 3 WEEKS IN COLOMBIA, YOU KNOW, A REAL WAR
HAS BEEN GOING ON, A WAR BEING WAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE DRUGS
MAFIA.  IN BOGOTA, MEDELLIN, CALI, AND OTHER TOWNS SHOTS ARE HEARD,
BOMBS EXPLODE, BLOOD IS FLOWING, AND MORE AND MORE OFTEN WE HEAR THE
WORDS THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THIS IS THE HEART OF THE COLOMBIAN MAFIA.
WHAT IS IT?  HOW DID IT FORM?  WITH THIS QUESTION I TURN TO YOU, YURIY
NIKOLAYEVICH.  INCIDENTALLY, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDELLIN.

   [ISAYEV] YES, WHILE WORKING IN LATIN AMERICA AS A CORRESPONDENT FOR
USSR STATE TELEVISION AND RADIO I WAS ABLE TO VISIT MEDELLIN ONCE.
THERE WAS A SEMINAR THERE ON THE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.
OUTWARDLY IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOWN, VERY GREEN, SITUATED ON A
PLAIN, AND IT IS CALLED ETERNALLY BLOSSOMING.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN
MEDELLIN BURSTS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE RANG OUT SUDDENLY IN THE STREETS
AND I UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT I WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE COCAINE MAFIA.
TWO CLANS OF BANDITS WERE EXCHANGING FIRE AND PASSERS-BY LITERALLY HAD
TO RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY COULD.

   LOCAL COLLEAGUES SHOWED ME A HUGE DISTRICT CONSISTING OF LUXURIOUS
VILLAS WHERE THE GODFATHERS OF THE COLOMBIA DRUG MAFIA LIVE.  IT IS
DIFFICULT TO EVEN APPROACH THESE HOUSES: THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY BARBED
WIRE AND THERE ARE VIDEO CAMERAS AND WATCH TOWERS.  IF YOU DECIDE TO
GO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING.  I WAS ALSO
ABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT.  THIS CASTLE
BELONGS TO ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA, CARLOS LEHDER.

   [VEDENYAPIN] YES, YURIY NIKOLAEVICH, BUT HOW WAS THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL FORMED?  SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD.

   [ISAYEV] BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE
CARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF
COLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES.  A FEW WORDS
ABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING
SACRED.  HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE.  IT IS NOT
FOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES
RUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON.  CARLOS LEHDER IS
DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION.  TOGETHER
WITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS
ADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES.  AT THE
END OF THE EIGHTIES [AS HEARD] A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE
CLANS.  LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL WAS FORMED

   [VEDENYAPIN] IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT
LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL.
IS THIS TRUE?

   [ISAYEV] THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8
BILLION.  TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU
THAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE
GOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK --
AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  NOT VERY LONG AGO
A WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS
BY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST.  I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE
THAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR
YEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN
NEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES,
SEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS.

   [VEDENYAPIN] HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED?

   [ISAYEV] IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST
WITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE
PENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY,
PARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY.  THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE
PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS
BUSINESS.  I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984
ORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF
JUSTICE.  IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE
NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS
MUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN.  IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS
ARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE
IMPRISONMENT.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF
ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.

   [VEDENYAPIN] IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED
ANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES? [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 17 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN POLICE REPORTED
THAT A HOMEMADE ROCKET WAS LAUNCHED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN BOGOTA THIS EVENING.  NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE WERE REPORTED.

   THE ROCKET PARTIALLY PERFORATED ONE OF THE WALLS OF THE EMBASSY,
BUT DID NOT EXPLODE.

   THE ALREADY TIGHT SECURITY SURROUNDING THE EMBASSY SINCE THE WAR
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIC WAS DECLARED WAS STEPPED UP IMMEDIATELY AND
TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS WERE KEPT OUT OF THE AREA.

   THIS ATTACKED FOLLOWED THE TWO DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED
EARLY SUNDAY EVENING IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF BOGOTA WHERE ONE PERSON
WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED AND APPROXIMATELY 30 LOCALS WERE DAMAGED.

   DURING THE BELISARIO BETACUR ADMINISTRATION (1982 - 1986), WHEN
SEVERAL COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED
STATES, THE U.S. EMBASSY WAS ATTACKED IN A SIMILAR MANNER.  NO
INJURIES WERE REPORTED DURING THAT ATTACK.  LATER, HOWEVER, A BOMB
EXPLODED IN THE EMBASSY'S PARKING LOT KILLING A COLOMBIAN WOMAN WHO
WAS STANDING IN LINE TO GET A VISA.

   LIKE IN OTHER ATTACKS OF THIS KIND REPORTED OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS
IN BOGOTA AND IN OTHER CITIES, NO ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK; HOWEVER, THE PRESS AND THE AUTHORITIES
ARE BLAMING PERSONS IN THE SERVICE OF THE DRUG LORDS.

   DHAKA (BANGLADESH), 9 SEP 89 (THE BANGLADESH OBSERVER) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS DECLARED HIS COUNTRY'S WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS IN A DRAMATIC MANNER, COMMITTING A MASSIVE FUND OF $7.86
BILLION FOR THE PROGRAMME, PROVIDING INCREASED POWERS TO
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN OFFERING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA, FIGHTING
THIS MENACE.  TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, "AMERICA'S TOUGHEST
DOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US
LEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE
AGAINST NARCOTICS.

   THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY,
MOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS
FIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS.  THE NEWS FROM
BOGOTA IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING.  IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG
DEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING
OF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
SHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN
OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO.  TO PUT IT
PLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR.  BUT WHETHER SHE
WINS OR LOSSES THIS BATTLE DEPENDS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE THE UNITED
STATES CAN PROVIDE TO THIS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   HERE, COLOMBIA FACES DIFFICULT OPTIONS.  WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED
SOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE
MAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE
RIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS.  THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON
WEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION.  THE
PROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT
FROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH
OF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES.  WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE
AGAINST DRUG BARONS.  BUT THE BATTLE WILL STILL BE HARD AND LONG.

   IN FIGHTING THIS RELENTLESS BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE DEALERS,
COLOMBIA HAS MADE ONE PERFECTLY VALID POINT, MORE THAN ONCE.  TRUE, IT
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS
INTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE.  BUT THE
REAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER
CITIES.  THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR
THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA.  AND IT IS
ALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION,
SOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH
HAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END.

   THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS
RECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  A
MAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE
USED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES.  BUT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE US CONGRESS
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION.  IN FACT,
THERE IS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN HAS NOT BEEN
"BOLD ENOUGH" EITHER.  WHILE ONE MUST ADMIT THAT THE US CONGRESSMEN
ARE USED TO MAKING SUCH CRITICISMS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION ON
PROBLEM ON WHICH THEY THEMSELVES RARELY OFFER ANY NEW INITIATIVE, ONE
HOPES THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP ITS NEWLY-UNVEILED
ANTI-DRUG PLAN UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY AND ENSURE THAT THE BATTLE THAT
COLOMBIA IS BEING URGED TO WIN AT ALL COSTS IS NOT LOST WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES.

SEIZED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF VITORIA (ESPIRITO SANTO STATE) DURING A
HUGE OPERATION CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT (DPF).  THE
OPERATION DISMANTLED THE "ESPIRITO SANTO-BOLIVIA CONNECTION," WHICH
CONSISTED OF EXCHANGING CARS THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN IN VITORIA FOR
BOLIVIAN OR COLOMBIAN COCAINE.  THE "MARSEILLE OPERATION," AS THE
OPERATION WAS CALLED, INVOLVED 70 POLICEMENT.  THE OPERATION WAS
COORDINATED BY THE RIO DE JANEIRO, SAO PAULO, AND ESPIRITO SANTO DPF.

   THE OPERATION'S MAIN OBJECTIVE -- THE ARREST OF STOLEN- CAR DEALER
JOAO LUIZ DE SOUZA -- WAS NOT ACHIEVED, HOWEVER, BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH
HAVING BEEN SURROUNDED BY SIX ARMED POLICEMEN, SOUZA MANAGED TO
ESCAPE.

FEW MINUTES AGO IN BOGOTA.  ONE BOMB EXPLODED IN WESTERN BOGOTA, ON
BOYACA AVENUE AND ELDORADO AVENUE, WHILE THE OTHER OCCURRED AT THE

   HAVANA (CUBA), NO DATE (CUBAVISION TELEVISION) -- [SPEECH] [CASTRO]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] I BELIEVE THAT MANY HAVE BEEN PREPARING THEMSELVES
DURING THE LAST YEARS.  WHATEVER COURSE HISTORY MAY TAKE IN THE
FUTURE, WE KNOW THAT HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS HAVE PREPARED THEMSELVES,
AND WE KNOW THAT IN THEIR WISDOM THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT ALLOW
SUCH A SAD HISTORY TO BE REPEATED, BE WHENEVER IT MAY.  [APPLAUSE]

   WE HAVE NOT SOWN IN THE DESERT OR PLOWED AT SEA.  THESE PAST 16
YEARS REPRESENT AN EXPERIENCE WHOSE VALUE IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
ASSESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  IT
IS CLEAR THAT THE PLEBISCITE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A STEP FORWARD.  I
REMEMBER THE DAY WE UNVEILED ALLENDE'S BUST AT THE HOSPITAL.  I
EXPRESSED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD VOTE AGAINST
PINOCHET, DESPITE PINOCHET'S RESOURCES AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
AND TERRORIST METHODS THAT WERE USED TO INTIMIDATE THE MASSES.  IT
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PEOPLE TO FORGET THE MANY CRIMES AND
MONSTROSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

   IN EFFECT, THE PLEBISCITE WAS A HARSH BLOW FOR PINOCHET. I THINK
ALSO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY HARSH BLOW, PERHAPS AN
IRREVERSIBLE BLOW, TO PINOCHET.  HOWEVER, IT IS A FACT THAT NOBODY CAN
ASSERT HERE THAT PINOCHET'S DEFEAT IN THE ELECTION WILL BE THE
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DICTATORSHIP IN CHILE.  I AM NOT
TALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION.  I THINK IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY.  THERE
WOULD BE NO SENSE IN TALKING HERE ABOUT A REVOLUTION [WORD INDISTINCT]
A STAGE ABOVE THE DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A
DEMOCRATIC OPENING, BUT THE ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT ENTAIL A SOLID
DEMOCRATIC OPENING YET.  HOWEVER, IN OUR OPINION IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
REPRESENT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.

   PINOCHET WILL TRY TO STAY ON AS HEAD OF THE ARMY AND AS HEAD OF THE
ARMED FORCES.  WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF
SENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO
HANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME.  WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS
HE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE
WILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.  ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE
CAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL
DEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE
REGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF
THESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT
FAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS.
LOOK AT HIS HARANGUES.  HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY,
AND THREATENING.  WE HEAR WARNINGS.  WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO
REMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF.

   I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE,
BECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  IT IS INEVITABLE
THAT THE PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT.  THEY WILL
INEVITABLY HAVE A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES,
OF ACTING, OF MOBILIZING, OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AT THE
MOMENT AND NOT ABOUT SHARES OF POWER.  I THINK THEY HAVE TO
BE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ADMIRABLE TEST OF
PATRIOTIC AND REVOLUTIONARY FEELING FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT RIGHTISTS,
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVES, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EVEN IN THE
CENTER BUT ON THE LEFT, AND WELL TO THE LEFT: TO GO TO THE POLLS AND
TO VOTE, FORGETTING WHICH PARTY IT WAS THAT PUT FORWARD THE CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT, OR WHAT THE CANDIDATE'S POLITICAL THINKING IS, JUST
THINKING OF CHILE, ONLY THINKING OF CHILE.  [CONTINUED]

   BUENOS AIRES, 19 SEP 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO
DUHALDE SAID TODAY THAT THE PROBLEM CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN
COLOMBIA "CANNOT" OCCUR IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS PRACTICALLY CREATED A "PARALLEL GOVERNMENT WITH THE IDEA
OF TAKING POWER."

   DUHALDE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO THAT COUNTRY IF ITS
LEADERS REQUEST THEM" BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS NOT
ONLY BUY "LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES," BUT ALSO
"HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS."

   IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NA DUHALDE CALLED ON SOCIETY TO THE
"PREVENT" DRUG ADDICTION IN ARGENTINA.

   THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION "IS A MILITARY ISSUE BECAUSE A REAL WAR IS
TAKING PLACE," DUHALDE SAID. HE ADDED THAT COLOMBIA IS "DIVIDED INTO
TWO COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL COUNTRY AND THE ONE RUN BY NARCOTICS." HE
SAID, "I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE LEGAL WILL WIN."

   ACCORDING TO DUHALDE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA "CANNOT OCCUR
IN ARGENTINA FOR SEVERAL DECADES." HE SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTS
THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO COLOMBIA IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM."
HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED: "THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY
CONGRESS."

   HE POINTED OUT THAT "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY OPERATING IN
THE COUNTRY BUT THEIR NATIONALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN." HE ADDED THAT
"THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT DISTRIBUTES THE DRUG IN ARGENTINA."

   DUHALDE SAID: "WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CONTINENT -- THE PRODUCTION AND
TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS." HE ADDED: "DRUGS ARE NOT PRODUCED IN ARGENTINA.
THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU."

   HE SAID: "IN 1988 IN MY BOOK 'POLITICIANS AND DRUGS' I WARNED ABOUT
THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS CLOSELY LINKED TO
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SHINING PATH IN PERU AND M-19 IN
COLOMBIA."

   DUHALDE INDICATED THAT "THE STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT INVOLVED HERE
BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA THE TRAFFICKERS ARE OF THE EXTREME
RIGHT -- NATIONALISTS."

   HE ADDED THAT "THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA INVOLVES
YOUTHS FROM 13 TO 20 YEARS OF AGE" AND THAT THAT IS WHY "PREVENTION
MEASURES SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, WHERE WE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE ILLS DRUGS CAUSE."

   DUHALDE, WHO IS GOING TO TOUR THE COUNTRY TO LECTURE ON "HOW TO
PREVENT DRUG ADDICTION," SAID THAT "IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO
INCLUDE THAT ISSUE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN
BECOME THE REAL FORCE FOR ENDING DRUG ADDICTION."

   HE REVEALED THAT COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY IS COMING CLOSE
TO MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER." HE SAID THAT
IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE "VERY HARSH REGULATIONS," SUCH AS THE DEATH
PENALTY, "FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT HOMICIDES AS THEY ARE DOING IN
COLOMBIA."

   REGARDING THE CHAOTIC COLOMBIAN SITUATION, DUHALDE SAID: "DRUG
TRAFFICKERS ARE A SORT OF PARALLEL GOVERNMENT THAT AIMS TO TAKE POWER.
I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS."

   HE SAID: "THIS IS NOT ONLY A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM; IT IS A CONTINENTAL
PROBLEM THAT NO ONE CAN SOLVE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THAT
IS WHY JOINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE TRAFFICKERS IN
DEATH."

   REGARDING HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, DUHALDE SAID THAT
HIS TALKS "DID NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE COUNTRIES
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION HAD
NOT YET DEVELOPED TO ITS CURRENT STAGE."

   HE CALLED THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS "MAFIA GANGS" THAT ARE "TRYING TO
SET UP A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK" FOR THEIR MERCHANDISE WHICH GIVES THEM
A PROFIT OF ABOUT $150 BILLION A YEAR ON SALES OF $500 BILLION."

   DUHALDE SAID THAT "THE DRUG LORDS BUY LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES,
BANKS, AND OFFICES. THEY ALSO FORM RELATIONS WITH POLITICIANS AND
MILITARY MEN." HE ADDED THAT "THEY HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO CORRUPT,"
AND "THEY SETTLE IN ONE PLACE WHEN THEY ARE SURE THEY WILL NOT BE
ARRESTED."

   HAVANA (CUBA), 16 SEP 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VIRTUALLY 10 YEARS OF
ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH HAS CLAIMED ALMOST 70,000 LIVES, THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT RECENTLY IN MEXICO CITY.
THIS COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PATH OF PEACE FOR
THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   AFTER 2 DAYS OF TALKS, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] REPRESENTATIVES AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AGREED TO
ESTABLISH A PERMANENT DIALOGUE TO SECURE A DEFINITE CEASE-FIRE.  ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL WILL HOST THE MEETING BETWEEN
THE NEGOTIATING PARTIES.  THE EVENT WILL BE ATTENDED BY TWO
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS MEDIATORS FOR THE SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE.  UN AND OAS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE INVITED TO
ATTEND AS WITNESSES.

   ASIDE FROM MATTERS OF PROCEDURE, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO SAY THAT, IN
ADDITION TO BEING DECISIVE IN ACHIEVING A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN
INTERNAL CRISIS, THE REBELS' RECENT PEACE INITIATIVE WAS A STRONG BLOW
TO THE RULING ULTRA-RIGHTIST SECTOR.  THE REBELS' WILLINGNESS TO END
HOSTILITIES AND TURN THE FMLN INTO A POLITICAL PARTY PLACED BEFORE
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI THE DECISION OF CONTINUING THE WAR OR
OPTING FOR PEACE.

   AS OF THAT MOMENT, AND IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE ASSIGNED TO THE
TALKS BY THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND ANALYSTS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC
OPINION KEPT ABREAST OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH IS SO VITAL FOR EL
SALVADOR AND FOR CENTRAL AMERICA.  FOR THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA], THE PROPOSALS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED TO AGREE ON A
TOTAL CEASE-FIRE BEFORE 31 JANUARY, TO END THE REPRESSION, TO CONDUCT
A PURGE IN THE ARMY, AND TO REORGANIZE THE JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL
SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH DETAILS WERE NOT GIVEN ON HOW THE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED,
THE FACT REMAINS THAT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL BEGIN
IN ONLY A MONTH.  IT MEANS THAT THE VEILED GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO
DELAY THE TALKS AND CONTINUE THE WAR, WHICH IT CANNOT WIN IN ANY
EVENT, HAS FAILED.  WE MIGHT EVEN ADD THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE
TELA SUMMIT WHICH APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES TO HOLD
DIALOGUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE REBELS.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S
ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE FORCEFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS AND
HIS ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THESE FORCES WITH THE NICARAGUAN
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ALSO FAILED.

   THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND ITS
WILLINGNESS TO SECURE A DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE IN EVIDENCE
AT THE NEXT MEETINGS.  MEANWHILE, THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE.  


DEV-MUC3-0498 (UMASS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 20 SEP 89 (TASS) -- [TEXT] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MASS
MEDIA HAS REGARDED THE INTENTION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING
CONSTITUTION AS A DEVIATION FROM RECENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE REBELS.

   THE INTENTION IS OUTLINED IN A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN
REPSONSE TO THE REBEL PROPOSAL TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN
THE POLITICAL LIFE IF THE ARMY CLEANS UP ITS RANKS, IF REPRESSIONS ARE
STOPPED, ELECTIONS TO MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE HELD
EARLIER THAN 1991 AND IF THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS REFORMED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA, THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS
WILL BE DOMINATE THE FMLN TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN
COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE SALVADORAN POLICE HAVE STAGED ANOTHER ACT OF
VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SPECIAL POLICE UNITS DISPERSED A
DEMONSTRATION ORGANISED BY THE FEDERATION OF SALVADORAN TRADE UNIONS
IN PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF 12 ACTIVISTS OF WORKERS' AND PEASANT
ORGANISATIONS.  ABOUT 100 DEMONSTRATORS SHELTERED IN A CATHEDRAL.
BUT, THE POLICE SMASHED THE CATHEDRAL'S WINDOWS AND SHOT TEAR GAS INTO
THE BUILDING.  POLICEMEN ALSO OPENED FIRE AND ARMY HELICOPTERS CIRCLED
OVER THE CATHEDRAL.

   DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE WERE WOUNDED, THE POLICE
DID NOT ALLOW RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVES TO APPROACH THE CATHEDRAL, AS
DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED.

   ABOUT 60 DEMONSTRATORS WERE FIRST BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THEN
ARRESTED, THE SAN SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA SAID.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 10 SEP 89 (MOSCOW) -- [REPORT] [LEONID LEVCHENKO]
[TEXT] A U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN HAS INDICATED THAT
WASHINGTON PROPOSES TO CONTINUE HELPING THE SALVADORAN REGIME UNTIL
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] COMBATANTS
SURRENDER THEIR ARMS.

   THE TIMING OF THIS STATEMENT IS REMARKABLE.  LET US RECALL THAT
LESS THAN 1 WEEK AGO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REBEL FORCES AND THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MET IN MEXICO, THUS LAUNCHING A DIALOGUE AIMED
AT A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED TO CONTINUE THESE
TALKS IN COSTA RICA ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, HOWEVER, EVEN THE FIRST
ROUND OF TALKS IN MEXICO SHOWED THAT CONTINUING THE WAR WAS POINTLESS
BECAUSE NEITHER OF THE PARTIES IS CAPABLE OF MILITARY DEFEATING THE
OTHER.  THUS, THE ONLY POSSIBLE VICTORY FOR ALL IS THE VICTORY OF
COMMON SENSE.  THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH NATIONAL DIALOGUE.
THE REBELS HAVE CORRECTLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO PRECONDITIONS CAN BE
SET FOR CONTINUING DIALOGUE, AND LESS STILL CAN IT BE DEMANDED THAT
THE FMLN COMBATANTS SHOULD UNILATERALLY SURRENDER THEIR ARMS.

   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS DEMAND IS BEING MADE WHILE THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT IS GETTING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY AID FROM THE UNITED STATES
AND, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN, IT HAS NO PLANS
TO DISCONTINUE THIS AID.

   THE SALVADORAN MILITARY IS USING U.S.-MADE WEAPONS ONLY AGAINST THE
REBELS AND NOT AGAINST ANY FOREIGN ENEMY.  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT
THROUGHOUT THE 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THE UNITED STATES
HAS SUPPLIED ALMOST $4 BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY AND NONMILITARY AID
TO THAT COUNTRY.  THANKS TO THIS ASSISTANCE, 70,000 SALVADORANS HAVE
BEEN KILLED AND OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO
SAVE THEIR LIVES.

   WE CAN SEE THAT ADDITIONAL U.S. MILITARY AID WILL INFLICT FURTHER
UNTOLD SUFFERING AND MISFORTUNES ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  PUTTING AN
END TO THIS ASSISTANCE AND TO ANY FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN SALVADORAN
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WOULD HELP DISPEL MUTUAL DISTRUST AND WOULD CREATE IN
THE COUNTRY AN ATMOSPHERE FAVORABLE TO NATIONAL DIALOGUE.
WASHINGTON'S DEMANDS THAT THE REBELS SHOULD SURRENDER THEIR ARMS AS A
PRECONDITION FOR WASHINGTON TO RECONSIDER THE ISSUE OF MILITARY AID TO
THE SALVADORAN REGIME REPRESENTS, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED,
UNACCEPTABLE INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.

   UNDOUBTEDLY, THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MUST TAKE PLACE
FREE OF ANY FOREIGN INTERFERENCE WHATSOEVER.  I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE
JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, A REBEL LEADER, WHO TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT
THE END OF U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME WOULD LEAD TO AN
IMMEDIATE END TO THE WAR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED, A
REBEL WAS KILLED, AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN HEAVY CLASHES IN THE
NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SALVADORAN ARMY REPORTED TODAY.

   THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN REPORTS THAT A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] REBEL WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
TODAY IN CLASHES IN DULCE NOMBRE DE MARIA, AND NUEVA CONCEPCION, IN
THE NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE PRESS COMMITTEE OF THE ARMED FORCES (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT THE
GUERRILLA'S ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE ON 19 SEPTEMBER DAMAGED A U.S.- MADE
UH-1H AIR FORCE HELICOPTER AS IT WAS EVACUATING A WOUNDED SOLDIER NEAR
SAN JOSE GUAYABAL, 30 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMED CLASHES
TOOK PLACE AMID THE FMLN 10-DAY UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE FMLN
ON 13 SEPTEMBER, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DIALOGUE HELD LAST WEEK
IN MEXICO CITY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS.

   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST THREE VILLAGES IN THE GUAZAPA HILL AREA, 25 KM
NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, TODAY REMAINED WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO THE
INTENSE CLASHES WHICH LASTED UNTIL DAYBREAK.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ONLY ADMITTED THAT A SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED
IN THESE CLASHES AND THAT A HELICOPTER HAS BEEN DAMAGED.  THE ARMY
CLAIMS IT HAS INFLICTED SEVERAL CASUALTIES ON THE REBELS, BUT THE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IS STILL UNKNOWN.

   ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN SOURCES IN THE ZONE, SEVERAL HELICOPTERS AND
AN AIRPLANE ON 19 SEPTEMBER AND TODAY AT DAYBREAK BOMBED ALLEGED REBEL
POSITIONS IN THE FOOTHILLS OF GUAZAPA HILL.

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 22 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [ARTICLE] [PAUL
IREDALE] [TEXT] ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATS, COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE MOVED TO GUATEMALA IN SEARCH OF NEW SUPPLY ROUTES,
BRINGING INSTABILITY TO A COUNTRY THAT IS EXPERIENCING A WAVE OF
VIOLENCE FROM VARIOUS SECTORS.

   THE DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT UP TO 200 COLOMBIANS LINKED TO THE
MEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS ARE NOW OPERATING IN GUATEMALA AND THAT
ABOUT 500 KG OF COCAINE PASS EVERY WEEK THROUGH THE COUNTRY,
ESSENTIALLY ENROUTE TO THE U.S. MARKET.

   THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITY COINCIDES WITH A NEW WAVE
OF KIDNAPPINGS, BOMBINGS, AND MURDERS IN GUATEMALA, AWAKENING FEARS
THAT THE COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO THE VIOLENCE PREVALENT AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE DECADE, WHEN THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BY DEATH SQUADS
DURING MILITARY REGIMES.

   SINCE AUGUST, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN, A WELL-KNOWN BANKER, AND AT
LEAST FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  SEVERAL BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT MONTHS AND STUDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ACTIVISTS ARE MISSING.

   "ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT
THE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN."

   IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE
UNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND
TEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN
GUATEMALA.  ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED
WENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR.

   THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS
MURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER
DRUG MONEY.  THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT
POLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK
SUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL
INTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY.

   "IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME,"
A DIPLOMAT SAID.

   WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN
GUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT
IS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF
POLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS.

   FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE
DEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986.

   THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY,
CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  IT HAS BLOCKED A
MAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING
TO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED
FORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS.

   "THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE,"
SAID A DIPLOMAT.  "IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO
OVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED."

   AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED
POLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP
ATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR
MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

   DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY
LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES.

   "NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING
BARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL,"
ONE DIPLOMAT SAID.

   FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
THAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO.

   MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL
AMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

   THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE
VIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990.

   "PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR
ELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA," A DIPLOMAT SAID.  "THINGS WILL PROBABLY
WORSEN NEXT YEAR."

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [CARLOS
MARIO MARQUEZ] [TEXT] A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY
MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE WILLING TO STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF A TROOP REDUCTION IF AN
AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH THE LEFTIST REBELS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.  GENERAL LARIOS MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO
FOUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTERS.  HERE ARE EXCERPTS OF
GENERAL LARIOS' STATEMENTS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES
WOULD CONSIDER A REDUCTION IN TROOPS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] [IN PROGRESS] ... WHEN IT INVOLVES
DAMAGING THE INSTITUTION -- IN THIS CASE THE ARMED FORCES -- WE MUST
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT BORN ON A WHIM, OR BY HAPPENSTANCE OR
ACCIDENT.  WE ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTION AND THE CONSTITUTION
HAS ESTABLISHED CLEAR TASKS FOR US.  THUS, OUR INSTITUTION IS
AUTHENTIC AND LEGAL.

   BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CONCEPT OR CRITERIA OF A REDUCTION IN ARMED
FORCES PERSONNEL CAN BE MANAGED IF IT IS BASED ON VERY PARTICULAR AND
SPECIFIC TERMS.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE REACH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE TERRORIST FORCES FOR THEIR PEACEFUL RETURN TO THE COUNTRY'S
DEMOCRATIC LIFE, THEN THIS WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE ARMED CONFLICT.
IT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT WE, AS THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES, WOULD HAVE
TO STUDY AND RECONSIDER THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WE
PRESENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE TO CONFRONT AN IMPOSED SITUATION, AN
AGGRESSION OF A MARXIST-LENINIST NATURE.  IF AN AGREEMENT IN THIS
SENSE IS REACHED, WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ANALYZE THE INSTITUTION'S
INTERNAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED
TO COMPLY WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  [END RECORDING]

   THOSE WERE STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER AT NOON.  HE
ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD BE WILLING TO STUDY A REDUCTION
IN FORCES IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REBEL
COMMISSIONS AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER.  GENERAL LARIOS SAID THAT PEACE WILL BE ATTAINED
BEFORE THE ESTABLISHED DATE IF THE REBELS SHOW THEIR GOOD WILL TO END
THE ARMED CONFLICT IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS WAS LAST MINUTE NEWS.  THIS IS

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS DIRECTORATE (DIC) OF THE GUATEMALAN POLICE
WERE SUDDENLY DISMISSED FROM THEIR POSTS, DIC DIRECTOR COLONEL
GEOVANNI CARDENAS REPORTED TODAY.

   "WE HAVE MADE THIS DECISION IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF THE POLICE FORCE," CARDENA SAID REFERRING TO THE
DISMISSAL OF THE DIC CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF, JORGE MENDEZ AND NOE
PINEDA, WHO WILL BE REPLACED BY REMBERT LARIOS AND MANUEL PINTO.

   THE SUDDEN DISMISSAL OF THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THE DIC TOOK PLACE 3
DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ADMITTED THAT THE SECURITY FORCES
ARE INVOLVED IN A WAVE OF KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF STUDENTS, WHICH HAS
SHAKEN THE COUNTRY.

   MEANWHILE, PETER H. KOOIJMANS, UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE
CASES, TODAY CONTINUED HIS MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY
TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 SEP 89 (PRENSA LIBRE) -- [TEXT] ARMY SPOKESMAN
COLONEL LUIS ARTURO ISAACS HAS SAID THAT POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL
DESIGNATED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY MAKES LIONEL SISNIEGA
OTERO A TERRORIST.  HOWEVER, COL ISAAC DID NOT CONFIRM WHETHER
SISNIEGA WAS INVOLVED IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

   INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS LIONEL SISNIEGA OTERO WH
SUPPLIED THE GRENADES TO THOSE WHO ARE NOW UNDER ARREST. ONCE
ARRESTED, SISNIEGA WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE COURT WHY HE HAD THE
WEAPONS, COL ISAACS ADDED.

   COL ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS INVESTIGATING
HOW AND FROM WHERE SISNIEGA OTERO OBTAINED THE WAR MATERIEL.

   THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID THE POSSESSION OF WAR MATERIEL BY
CIVILIANS IS PROHIBITED AND PUNISHABLE BY LAW. IN THIS RESPECT,
CIVILIAN PROTECTION SYSTEM AUTHORITIES SHOULD DEEPEN THEIR
INVESTIGATIONS AND THE COURTS SHOULD BE STRICTER.

   ASKED ABOUT THE SURPRISING AND SUDDEN MANNER IN WHICH CAPTAIN
LIONEL SISNIEGA CORDERO, SON OF SISNIEGA OTERO, WAS SENT OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, COL ISAACS SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN DONE FOR HIS PERSONAL
SAFETY, SINCE ANY EXTREMIST FACTION COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
SITUATION TO TRY TO HARM HIM.

   ISAACS CONFIRMED THAT CAPT SISNIEGA OTERO WAS APPOINTED MILITARY
ATTACHE AT THE GUATEMALAN EMBASSY IN VENEZUELA AND THAT FILLING THIS
POSITION IS PART OF THE SOLDIER'S DUTY.

   WHEN ASKED WHETHER CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO COULD HAVE SUPPLIED THE
WEAPONS TO HIS FATHER, COL ISAACS REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY, ADDING
THAT EVERY OFFICER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL THAT KEEPING WAR MATERIEL AT
HOME IS FORBIDDEN AND IN VIOLATION OF ARMED FORCES DIRECTIVES.

   POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IS A MISDEMEANOR AND NOT A FELONY, COL ISAAC
SAID.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE SAID HE HAS A "GALIL" WHICH HE KEEPS AT HIS
OFFICE, ALTHOUGH HE CARRIES HIS HANDGUN WHEREVER HE GOES.

   HOWEVER, HE SAID THE POSSIBILITY IS BEING INVESTIGATED, ALTHOUGH H
CONSIDERS IT FAR-FETCHED. AS A RULE THE ARMY PROTECTS ITS MEMBERS, AN
THIS IS PRECISELY WHY CAPT SISNIEGA CORDERO WAS GIVEN DIPLOMATIC
STATUS AND SENT TO VENEZUELA.

   ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, COL ISAACS SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF A
GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ACATENENGO DETACHMENT, POINTING OUT THAT THE
GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG) MAKES FALSE CLAIMS THAT
DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH REALITY.

   THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT RUMORS OF A RECENT SUBVERSIVE GROUP
ATTACK ON THE ACATENANGO DETACHMENT DURING WHICH MANY CASUALTIES WERE
INFLICTED.

AGAINST A BRANCH OFFICE OF THE DAILY EL ESPECTADOR, WEST OF BOGOTA,
HAS RESULTED IN INJURIES TO A POLICEMAN AND HEAVY PROPERTY DAMAGE, IT
WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, SEVERAL MEN RIDING IN AN AUTOMOBILE THREW
A POWERFUL BOMB AT THE MORNING DAILY'S OFFICE, INJURING SIGIFREDO
AREVALO WHO WAS GUARDING THE SITE.

   ON 2 SEPTEMBER THE MAIN OFFICES OF EL ESPECTADOR WERE PARTIALLY
DESTROYED BY A POWERFUL BOMB.  THAT ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG
MAFIAS AGAINST WHICH THE NEWSPAPER HAS COURAGEOUSLY SET ITSELF.

   SINCE THAT DATE, THE NARCO-TERRORISTS HAVE CARRIED OUT 30 DYNAMITE
ATTACKS IN BOGOTA, THE NEW SITE OF THE "WAR" THAT BEGAN IN MEDELLIN.

   NINE POLITICAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS, STATE AND PRIVATE BANK OFFICES,

BOGOTA NEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR AND THE OFFICE OF THE MORNING NEWSPAPER
EL SIGLO WERE THE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS TONIGHT WHICH LEFT ONE
POLICEMAN SLIGHTLY INJURED AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE, THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED.

   IN THE FIRST ATTACK, A 5-KG DYNAMITE CHARGE EXPLODED IN A BRANCH OF
EL ESPECTADOR IN THE SUBURB OF NORMANDIA IN THE WESTERN PART OF
BOGOTA.

   A SECURITY GUARD WAS INJURED BY THE SHATTERED GLASS CAUSED BY THE
IMPACT OF THE EXPLOSION.

   ALTHOUGH THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED, SOME 10
HOMES NEARBY WERE.

   THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF EL ESPECTADOR, A NEWSPAPER WHICH HAS
MAINTAINED A HARDLINE POSITION ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND WHOSE DIRECTOR
WAS ASSASSINATED IN DECEMBER 1986, WAS THE TARGET OF A VIOLENT CAR
BOMB ATTACK 20 DAYS AGO.

   IN ANOTHER TERRORIST ACTION, SEVERAL MEN IN A VEHICLE OPENED FIRE
ON THE OFFICES OF THE NEWSPAPER EL SIGLO, BUT NOBODY WAS INJURED.

   THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK OF THIS KIND AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER IN THE
PAST FEW DAYS.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEWSPAPER IS FORMER PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE ALVARO GOMEZ.

   IN VIEW OF THE INCREASED DYNAMITE ATTACKS SINCE 21 SEPTEMBER, WHEN
NINE POLITICAL OFFICES AND THREE BANK BRANCHES WERE ATTACKED, THE ARMY

COLOMBIAN EMBASSY IN KINGSTON HAS BEEN TIGHTENED FOLLOWING A BOMB
THREAT ON MONDAY [18 SEPTEMBER], THE GLEANER NEWSPAPER REPORTED.

   SINCE MONDAY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED PRESENCE OF UNIFORMED
POLICEMEN ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE XEROX BUILDING WHERE THE
COLOMBIAN EMBASSY HAS ITS OFFICES.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLOMBIAN EMBASSY WERE UNWILLING TO TALK TO
CANA, BUT THE GLEANER REPORTED THAT MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY K.D.
KNIGHT HAD CONFIRMED THAT THREATS HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST THE EMBASSY
AND THAT THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  HE SAID
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ALARM.  KNIGHT SAID THAT THE EMBASSY HAD
RECEIVED A THREATENING NOTE AND THAT THE MINISTRY HAD ALSO RECEIVED
ONE THROUGH A "CHANNEL", BUT GAVE NO DETAILS.

   SINCE TAKING OFFICE, THE MANLEY GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED ITS FIRM
COMMITMENT TO STAMP OUT DRUG ABUSE AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  JAMAICA IS
SAID TO BE A TRANSSHIPMENT POINT FOR DRUGS SHIPPED FROM SOME LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER, HOWEVER, SAID THAT FROM ALL
INDICATIONS THE ACTION WAS A "TOTALLY INTERNAL ONE" AND THERE WAS NO
OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS WITH THE DRUG WAR BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT
AND THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL.  "WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MATTER WITH ALL
SERIOUSNESS, BUT PRESENT INDICATIONS SHOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO BE
ALARMED AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN
PLACE", HE SAID.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY
SOURCE CLOSE TO VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED TODAY THAT "THE
OFFICERS OF THE MOUNTAIN" [ODEM], A SECRET MILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT
CONDUCTED TWO FAILED COUPS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF, MAY BE
INVOLVED IN THE WAVE OF TERRORIST EXPLOSIONS, ABDUCTIONS, AND
POLITICAL MURDERS THAT HAS BEEN SCOURGING GUATEMALA OVER THE LAST 2
MONTHS.

   THE MILITARY SOURCE, WHO MADE STATEMENTS TO AFP ON THE CONDITION
THAT HIS IDENTITY WAS NOT REVEALED, SAID THAT "THOSE GENTLEMEN (ODEM)
HAVE BECOME THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY" OF CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT.

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT "THE COUNTRY IS AGAIN FACING CERTAIN THREATS,
INCLUDING THAT OF THOSE GENTLEMEN."

   THUS FAR, NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHO THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION
ARE, ALTHOUGH SOME MEDIA SOURECES CLAIM THEY ARE "VERY POWERFUL AND
WELL ORGANIZED."

   AMID THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN SHAKING GUATEMALA OVER
THE LAST 2 MONTHS, "ODEM" HAS BEEN MARKING ITS INCREASING PRESENCE
THROUGH FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES RELEASED CLANDESTINELY IN GUATEMALA CITY.
IN THE COMMUNIQUES, IT LAUNCHES HARSH ATTACKS ON THE CURRENT
GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT.

   IN ONE OF THEIR MOST RECENT COMMUNIQUES, WHICH THEY CIRCULATED IN
GUATEMALA CITY LAST WEEK, THE REBEL MILITARY MEN SAY: "WE WILL NOT
STOP UNTIL WE CHANGE THIS SYSTEM OF ANARCHY, CORRUPTION, AND DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL ARMY SPOKESMAN, THE SEDITIOUS MILITARYMEN
"ARE OFFICERS WHO WERE REMOVED FROM POWER IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND
LOST ALL THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THE BARRACKS.  THEIR RESENTMENT IS BEING
MANIPULATED BY POLITICAL, CONSERVATIVE FORCES.

   "THEY ARE MANIPULATED BY PEOPLE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN OTHER
WORDS, BY POLITICAL CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO POWER TO REGAIN
THEIR PAST PRIVILEGES." THIS WAS STATED TODAY BY ONE OF THE MILITRAY
OFFICERS WHO LINKED THE THE ODEM TO THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM IN THE
COUNTRY.

   THE SAME SOURCE ADMITTED THAT THE SUSPECTED MILITARY TERRORISTS
COULD HAVE "SUPPORTERS" WITHIN THE ARMY, BUT ADDED THAT "THE UNITY" OF
THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES IS NOT THREATENED BY THEM.

   IN THEIR FREQUENT COMMUNIQUES, ODEM IDENTIFIES ITSELF AS "PATRIOTS
WHO OPPOSE THE COMMUNIST AND CORRUPT SYSTEM THEY [NOT FURTHER
IDENTIFIED] WANT TO IMPOSE ON US THROUGH THE CURRENT POLICY
IMPLEMENTED BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CLIQUE IN POWER."

FOUR MORE BOMBS IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT BOGOTA.  THE CAPITAL HAS
BEEN THE TARGET OF SIX TERRORIST ATTACKS DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.

   THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED AT A BUILDING LOCATED ON THE CORNER OF 7TH

MONTHS AGO IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL GENERAL MIGUEL ALFREDO MAZA. REPAIRS

   QUITO, 14 SEP 89 (EL COMERCIO) -- [TEXT] THE ECUADORAN POLICE DEALT
A HARSH BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT CAPTURED JUAN HERNANDO
GONZALEZ AND GERMAN BELANDRIA, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WORKED FOR THE
COLOMBIAN CARTELS.

   ACTING GOVERNMENT MINISTER LUIS FELIX LOPEZ SAID THE TWO COLOMBIANS
WERE ARRESTED IN TAISHA, IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN REGION, WHEN THEIR
AIRPLANE VIOLATED ECUADOR'S AIR SPACE.

   THE AIRPLANE, A LUXURY CESSNA 210 TWIN-MOTOR AIRCRAFT WITH A
COLOMBIAN REGISTRATION, WAS FORCED TO LAND BY THE ECUADORAN ARMED
FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO ECUADOR RADIO, THE AIRCRAFT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING
IN THE AREA OF BUFFO IN PASTAZA PROVINCE.  THE RADIO ADDED THAT THE
AIRPLANE, NAMED CENTURION, IS WHITE AND HAS THE REGISTRATION NUMBER
H-K-27-29.

   ONCE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED THEY WERE BROUGHT TO QUITO
AND DEPORTED TO COLOMBIA, WHERE THEY WILL BE TRIED.

   ACTING MINISTER LOPEZ SAID THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED IN TAISHA AT
1000 ON 14 SEPTEMBER.  THE AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS FLYING OVER ECUADORAN
TERRITORY TOWARD AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION, IS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE
ECUADORAN ARMED FORCES AT THE TAISHA AIRPORT.

   THE TWO TRAFFICKERS HAD $336,000 IN THEIR POSSESSION.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO STOP THE
INFILTRATION OF FOREIGNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE ARREST OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WAS COORDINATED BY THE MINISTRY
OF DEFENSE AND THE POLICE.

   GONZALEZ AND BELANDRIA ARE PRESUMABLY LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING
ACTIVITIES, GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CARRIED AND THE FACT
THAT THEY WERE CLANDESTINELY FLYING OVER ECUADORAN TERRITORY.

   IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS COVERING THE CALI-PUERTO
ASIS-LETICIA (COLOMBIA) ROUTE.

SENATORS HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.  THEY HAD A GREAT DEBATE TO [WORDS
INDISTINCT] A SIGN SHOWING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP SUPPORT THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THEY VOTED IN FAVOR OF CONTINUING WITH
THE MILITARY AID [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THEY APPROVED AID THAT WILL BE
INVESTED IN WAR, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT A SIGN OF PEACE.  THERE WERE
TWO POSITIONS AT THE SENATE: THOSE WHO ADVOCATED THAT THE AID BE
DIVIDED IN THREE PACKAGES TO CONTINUE THE DELIVERY OF THE LAST PORTION
OF THE AID TO THE GOVERNMENT AMID THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND THOSE WHO
WANTED TO GIVE UNCONDITIONAL AID TO CRISTIANI, A POSITION BASICALLY
DEFENDED BY CHRISTOPHER DODD.  SENATOR DODD HIMSELF SAID THIS AID IS
ALLEGEDLY TO ENCOURAGE CRISTIANI BECAUSE HE IS ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THE
UNITED STATES HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.

   HOWEVER, THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE. THEY VOTED FOR THE
UNCONDITIONAL AID WHICH ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THE MILITARY MEN AND THE
HARDLINERS IN ARENA [NATIONALISTIC REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] WHO ARE
BLOCKING THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT AND WHO UNREASONABLY
PROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR.  THIS IS NOT A SIGN FOR THE
MODERATES.  THE VOTING FOR UNCONDITIONAL AID IS INTERPRETED BY THE
FASCISTS, THE WARMONGERING, THE ARENA [WORDS INDISTINCT] AS A BLANK
CHECK TO CONTINUE WITH THE ADVENTURE OF WAR.  THIS WAS THE TIME FOR
U.S. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT WITH THEIR VOTING THE
REGIONAL EFFORT AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S EFFORT TO ATTAIN PEACE IN
EL SALVADOR.

   THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS TAKEN
UNMISTAKABLE STEPS THAT EXPRESS ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP ATTAIN PEACE.
HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THE U.S. SENATORS ARE MISINFORMED ABOUT EVENTS IN EL
SALVADOR: THE INCREASE IN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, THE ARRESTS, THE
BOMBINGS, THE WAR PARADES, AND THE HARASSMENT OF THE PRESS.  IN SUM,
THESE ARE WAR ACTIONS AMID A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR
NEGOTIATIONS TO ATTAIN PEACE.

   THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE.  WAR ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE
CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CLEARLY COME
FROM THE [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE ARENA HARDLINERS.  THEY ALSO ALSO
FROM THE U.S. SENATORS WHO VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE UNCONDITIONAL AID.
THEREFORE, THE U.S. SENATORS GAVE A SIGN [WORDS INDISTINCT] ARE
ENCOURAGING THE WAR WITH THIS BLANK CHECK TO THE ARENA GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 23 SEP 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT]
[MAURICIO FUNES] [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO
STATED TODAY THAT THE MILITARY ASPECTS OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT MAY REDUCTIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, AN
EFFECTIVE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE
CONTROL OF VIOLENT ACTIONS BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.
MERINO MADE REFERENCE TO THE DOUBTS THAT CERTAIN MILITARY COMMAND
SECTORS HAVE ABOUT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THAT THESE DOUBTS ARE
PRESENT, MAINLY BECAUSE THE REBELS HAVE NOT KEPT THEIR PUBLIC PROMISES
CONCERNING MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL
COMMENTED THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO
NEGOTIATIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS MILITARY TROOP REDUCTIONS,
THAT MUST BE ACCEPTED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  LET US HEAR VICE PRESIDENT
MERINO:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE FMLN AND EVEN
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE PROMISES THAT THEY NEVER KEPT.  THE
ARMED FORCES ARE A PERMANENT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY
SUFFERED THE NONCOMPLIANCE OF AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH THE FMLN.  NOW, THE LACK OF TRUST MUST BE
OVERCOME WITH SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MUST BE CLEARLY APPRECIATED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT;
THEY ARE AN INSTITUTION.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS THE GENERAL COMMANDER
OF THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION IS ALSO
INCLUDED IN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S STATEMENTS. [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO MERINO, COMMENTARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL
MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS COMMENTARIES OUTSIDE ANY
AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REACH WITH THE REBELS.  ON THE SAME
SUBJECT, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO COMMENTED THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR
THE GUERRILLAS TO CHANGE THEIR MILITARY BEHAVIOR, AS THEY HAVE TO SHOW
THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO START A PROGRESSIVE WAR DE-ESCALATION
PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TOTALITY WITH WHICH
THE FMLN STOPS HOSTILITIES; CEASES ITS ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST
ELECTRICITY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES; AND
STOPS THE USE OF MINES WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY'S OFFENSIVE ACTIONS.  THIS IS LOGICAL, AS WHEN THERE IS NO
AGGRESSION, THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TO COUNTER IT. [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT FOR
THE FMLN TO DRASTICALLY DECREASE STREET VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR, SUCH
AS THE VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS RECENTLY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] HOSTILITIES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE ACTIONS
THAT INCLUDE THE USE OF MILTARY FORCE, SUCH AS MINES, BOMBS, AND SO
ON.  THEY ALSO INCLUDE FMLN MASS ORGANIZATION ACTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED
OUT MAINLY IN SAN SALVADOR AND ARE CREATING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
DESTABILIZATION.  IT IS A KIND OF URBAN TERRORISM, AS THESE GROUPS ARE
DISTORTING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST OR THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION.  THESE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE NO LONGER ONLY CARRYING A MESSAGE, BUT HAVE STARTED
TO DESTROY AND DAMAGE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND
THREATEN THE CITIZENS' INTEGRITY.  THUS, YOU SEE HERE A DIRECT
RELATIONSHIP WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS AND
CEASEFIRE MUST INCLUDE URBAN ACTIONS, AS WELL.  A CEASEFIRE MUST ALSO
INCLUDE THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT CARRY OUT OFFENSIVE ACTIONS OR ACTIONS
BY FACADE GROUPS IN THE CITIES THAT PROMOTE STREET DISORDER.  [END
RECORDING]

   DURING PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S 15-DAY-ABSENCE, MERINO REPORTED THAT
HE WILL WORK ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT TO THE
FMLN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA ON 16 OCTOBER, WITH AN ADVISORY
COMMISSION FORMED BY MILITARY OFFICERS, PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN,
INTELLECTUALS, AND POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS.

AS THE FLIGHT OF GUATEMALANS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE
REESTABLISHMENT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ADVISORY, HAVE AFFECTED
GUATEMALA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.

COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] JUST
10 DAYS AFTER A DIALOGUE WAS HELD IN MEXICO, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME
MORE TENSE IN VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENTS AND ARMED FORCE'S ATTITUDE.  THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS WILLINGNESS AND FLEXIBILITY BY CARRYING
OUT UNILATERAL ACTIONS, AND PRESENTING A REALITISTIC PEACE PROPOSAL
THAT COVERS THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE ENTIRE NATION IN ENDING THE
CONFLICT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

   2.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT
MADE ANY EFFORTS, BUT RATHER THEY HAVE HARDENED THEIR STANDS AND
CARRIED OUT REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.  IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, WHILE WE
OFFERED A UNILATERAL TRUCE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE
CONDUCTED PROVOKING WAR ACTIONS; LAUNCHED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE
AREAS UNDER GUERRILLA CONTROL; BOMBED CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN MORAZAN,
CHALATENANGO, AND GUAZAPA; MAINTAINED A MILITARY SEIGE ON THE
UNIVERSITY AND TRADE UNION BUILDINGS; AND EVICTED PEASANTS AND TENANTS
FROM THEIR LANDS.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN
UNLEASHING A MERCILESS REPRESSION AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
PEOPLE, TRADE UNIONS, PEASANTS, RELIGIOUS GROUPS, AND STUDENTS.  THE
NATION HAS BEEN SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT OVER 400 PEOPLE WERE CAPTURED IN
THE LAST MONTH.

   DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE MISSING OR DEAD.  THE FASCIST BRUTAL
GOVERNMENT IS NOT ASHAMED TO EXHIBIT UNDIGNIFIED PICTURES OF TRADE
UNION LEADERS -- WHO SHOW SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN TORTURED -- TESTIFYING
BEFORE JUDGES.  THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY SHOWS THE HORROR OF WOMEN WHO
HAVE BEEN RAPED IN THE PRISONS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE OUTRAGES
COMMITTED AGAINST THE BAPTIST CHURCH, AND THE BEATINGS AND THREATS
AGAINST NEWSMEN.  THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS TERRIFYING PHOTOGRAPHS IN
THE NEWSPAPERS OF WORKERS TIED BY THEIR THUMBS, AND BLINDFOLDED IN THE
MOST REPULSIVE STYLES OF THE DEATH SQUADS.

   WE HAVE REACHED SUCH A STATE OF PROVOCATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO IS TRYING TO HUMILIATE PUBLICLY THE PEOPLE'S SECTORS
BY CALLING THEM TRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN TRIED TO SOLVE THE
CASE OF THE WAR HANDICAPPED; THERE ARE 45 OF THEM OCCUPYING THE
METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL.  THE ONLY ANSWER TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL
ATTENTION ABROAD IS THE RIOT POLICEMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THREATEN
ATTACKING [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO ACHIEVE THE FREEDOM OF 11 INNOCENT
YOUTHS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT A LOCAL CLINIC.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED SENDING $90 MILLION TO THE FASCIST
GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE WAR AND REPRESSION.

   3.  THIS STATE OF REPRESSION AND THIS MOCKERY TO THE LEGITIMATE
ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE SAY: NO MORE CAPTURES, TORTURE, MURDERS, BOMBINGS, SIEGES,
EVICTIONS, OR HUMILIATION!

   TO OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, WE SAY THAT JUST LIKE WE REMAIN
FLEXIBLE AND OPEN FOR NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL LIKEWISE BE WILLING, ABLE,
AND READY TO ACCOMPANY THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE AND STRONGLY CARRY
THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE TO ADVANCE UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED THAT
FLAG INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ONLY WANT WAR.

   THIS GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY ORDERS ALL OUR GROUPS, FIGHTERS,
MILITIA MEMBERS, AND COLLABORATORS TO DEFEND WITH HONOR AND STRENGTH
AND WITH THEIR WEAPONS THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT THE ENTIRE
NATION DEMANDS.

   WE HEREBY NOTIFY THAT TODAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1989, OUR FORCES HAVE
BEGUN A NATIONAL MANEUVER THAT WE CALL "STOP THE REPRESSION, EVERYONE
FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE." OUR MANEUVER CALLS FOR
ATTACKING SEVERAL GARRISONS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE
FOUR REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE WILL CONTINUE REPORTING ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIONS IN THE FOUR WAR FRONTS IN A FORTHCOMING
COMMUNIQUE.

   AGAINST REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.

GUERRILLAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE THE END
OF THE WAR AND INCREASING THE "REPRESSION" AGAINST WORKERS.

   IN A LETTER DISCLOSED ON MONDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER, AND SENT TO THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE
AMERICAS, THE REBELS SAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES "ARE MAINTAINING THEIR INFLEXIBILITY,
USING THE CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IS WARNING
THAT THERE ARE TWO STANCES IN THE FACE OF THE DIALOGUE: ONE IS OF
"FLEXIBILITY AND GOODWILL," AND THE OTHER, OF "INFLEXIBILITY AND
PROVOCATION THAT USES THE DIALOGUE TO ESCALATE THE WAR AND
REPRESSION."

   IN ITS LETTER, THE FMLN GAVE A RUNDOWN OF ITS BIDS TO "PROMOTE A
DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION" WITH THE GOVERNMENT, MENTIONING ITS UNILATERAL
TRUCE AND DECISION TO STOP SABOTAGING THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE
NETWORKS AND USING MINES.

   IN ADDITION, THE GROUP NOTED IT SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL "THAT IS VERY
FLEXIBLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE," AND THAT CONSIDERS THE END OF
HOSTILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REBELS MAY BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   HOWEVER, THE REBELS STATED THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED HUMAN
RIGHTS "VIOLATIONS," AND IS KEEPING A CIRCLE AROUND THE UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS AND TRADE UNIONS, YET IT WANTS DILATORY TALKS WITHOUT
COMMITTMENTS.

   THE FMLN SAID THE APPROVAL BY THE U.S. SENATE OF MILITARY AID TO EL
SALVADOR, UPPING IT FROM $85 TO $90 MILLION, "ENCOURAGES THE MOST HARD
LINE SECTOR OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN REGIME."

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE MILITARY AID "CONSTITUTES A HARD
BLOW AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT," THAT IN 9 YEARS HAS CLAIMED OVER 70,000
LIVES.

   GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS MET FROM 13 TO 15 SEPTEMBER IN
MEXICO AND PLEDGED TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THAT COUNTRY'S
STRIFE.

   THE TWO DELEGATIONS AGREED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS ON 16 AND 17
OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE TO ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE AND
ESTABLISH THE STEPS TO END THE WAR.

   DIVERSE LOCAL SECTORS, WHICH ARE DEMANDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE WAR, HAVE RECEIVED THE AGREEMENTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM.

   HOWEVER, SOME LEADERS OF RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) AND SOME MILITARY CHIEFS HAVE QUESTIONED THE FMLN'S OFFERS.

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP [19
APRIL MOVEMENT], WHICH IS ABOUT TO SIGN A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE
GOVERNMENT, TODAY PROPOSED OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.  ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, ONE OF THE DRUG
LORDS IS SURROUNDED.

   MEANWHILE, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL IN THE CARTAGENA DE
INDIAS TOURIST CENTER, ON THE CARIBBEAN, KILLING TWO PERSONS.  IT IS
BELIEVED THE BOMB WAS PLACED BY GROUPS LINKED TO NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.

   THE M-19 PROPOSED PARDONING THOSE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WHO
DISMANTLE THEIR BUSINESSES AND BECOME LAW-ABIDING.

   IN RADIO STATEMENTS MADE TODAY, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO
LEONGOMEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS MADE CONTACT WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, WHO HAVE REPORTEDLY SAID THEY ARE WILLING
TO JOIN A GENERAL PEACE PLAN.

   THE PROPOSAL WAS SIGNED BY THE HIERARCHY OF THE M-19 -- FOUNDED IN
1974 AND ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS -- IN
THEIR CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, SOME 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

   IN EXCHANGE FOR DISMANTLING THE LABORATORIES AND THE ARMED GROUPS,
THE M-19 PROPOSED NOT EXTRADITING THE ALLEGED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS TO
THE UNITED STATES.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL HAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO
BARCO, INASMUCH AS IT HAD VOICED ITS DETERMINATION NOT TO HOLD ANY
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, A JUDICIAL SOURCE HAS TOLD
REUTER.

   "THE ISSUE OF THE DIALOGUE IS BECOMING VERY SERIOUS AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY A WAR ALWAYS
CONCLUDES WITH A PEACE AGREEMENT," ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF FORMER
JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF SAID.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES A PLAN SO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES WILL FINANCE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUG
CONSUMPTION, HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED YET BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE ISSUE OF THE
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WILL NOT FORM PART OF THE
PEACE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE M-19.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS HAVE HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

   AT FIRST, SOME ARMED GROUPS GAVE PROTECTION TO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY FOR PURCHASING WEAPONS.  HOWEVER,
LATER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY WERE
HARSHLY FOUGHT BY THE PARAMILITARY BANDS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT FINANCED
WITH DRUG MONEY.

   PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE TOPIC WILL NOT AFFECT THE SIGNING OF
THE AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED SINCE 24 SEPTEMBER FOR
"LAST-MINUTE MINOR DIFFICULTIES."

   HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS
OVER 600 MILITANTS, WILL NOT BE TURNED OVER TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, PROBABLY THE RED CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 -- WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PEACE PLAN SHOULD
BE DEMOBILIZED AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IS ASKING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALSO KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO," IS SURROUNDED
AND WILL BE IMMINENTLY CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) HAS
TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE CAPTURING IMPORTANT PEOPLE WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW IF RODRIGUEZ GACHA WILL
ALSO BE CAPTURED."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED THE CAPOS OF THE
FEARFUL MEDELLIN CARTEL, A NARCOTICS ORGANIZATION WHICH TOGETHER WITH
ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI IS CHARGED WITH EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF
THE COCAINE CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A 100-MILLION-PESOS REWARD
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF
THE TWO MOST-WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   ON 25 SEPTEMBER, A JUDGE ORDERED THE ARRESTED OF FREDDY RODRIGUEZ
CELADES, SON OF "EL MEXICANO," FOR ILLEGAL PSSESSION OF FIREARMS.

   NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THE TWO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE IN COLOMBIAN
TERRITORY, THUS DENYING RUMORS TO THE EFFECT THEY WERE SETTING UP
BASES IN PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN
REPORTED THAT THE AIRSTRIP IN CHILANGA, 5 KM NORTH OF THE CITY OF SAN
FRANCISCO DE LA GOTERA, WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DESTROYED. SEVERAL OTHER
POSITIONS INSIDE THE CITY WERE ALSO ATTACKED. UNTIL NOW, NO GOVERNMENT
OR REBEL CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE HIGHWAY LEADING FROM SAN
FRANCISCO GOTERA TO SAN MIGUEL WAS MINED BY THE REBELS. TRAFFIC ALONG
THIS HIGHWAY HAS CEASED UNTIL NOW.

   IN LA UNION, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
REBELS SAID THAT TROOPS OF THE FONSECA BATTALION OF THE 3RD DETACHMENT
OF LA UNION WERE ATTACKED IN SAN SEBASTIAN NEAR SANTA ROSA DE LIMA.
THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CAPTURED 3 SOLDIERS. ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN
FRANCISCO GOTERA, THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CAPTURED 2 SOLDIERS OF THE 4TH
DETACHMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA.

   IN OTHER INCIDENTS, IT WAS REPORTED THAT SINCE 1600 LOCAL TIME ON
25 SEPTEMBER THERE HAVE BEEN FIERCE CLASHES IN VALLE NUEVO NEAR EL
PARAISO IN CHALATENANGO. UNTIL NOW OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOT REPORTED
ANY CASUALTIES.

   IN EL PAPAYAL, CIVILIAN SOURCES REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO
INCIDENTS IN THIS GOVERNMENT TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND MICROWAVE STATION.

   CLASHES CONTINUED THIS MORNING BETWEEN TROOPS OF THE 3RD AND 6TH
INFANTRY BRIGADES IN USULUTAN. PATROLS ARE CHASING THE REBELS.

   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT IN CIUDAD BARRIOS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
SAN MIGUEL THE REBELS PLACED SOME ROADBLOCKS AND DISTURBED MILITARY
POSITIONS. NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THESE INCIDENTS.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN YOLAIQUIN THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED TROOPS
OF THE 4TH DETACHMENT OF GOTERA. YOLAIQUIN IS IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   IN MONCAGUA, ALSO IN SAN MIGUEL, ROADBLOCKS WERE PLACED ON THE
HIGHWAY TO CHAPELTIQUE. NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED IN THESE
INCIDENTS.

   THE NATIONAL GUARD POST IN SESORI, NORTH OF SAN MIGUEL, WAS ALSO
ATTACKED.  NO CASUALITES WERE REPORTED IN THIS INCIDENT.

   IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN CUSCATLAN , IT WAS REPORTED THAT TROOPS OF
THE 5TH DETACHMENT GUARDING THE BRIDGE AT LAS GUARAS WERE ATTACKED
EARLY THIS MORNING BY THE REBELS. NO OFFICIAL BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED
BY THE 5TH DETACHMENT.

   THE TOWN OF SAN BARTOLOME PERULAPIA WAS ATTACKED. NO ADDITIONAL
DETAILS ARE KNOWN.

   UNTIL NOW, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA, HAS ONLY
REPORTED FOUR SOLDIERS WOUNDED IN THE SAN FRACISCO GOTERA AREA. IT
ADMITS THAT THE AIRSTRIP IN CHILANGA WAS DAMAGED. NO CASUALTIES HAVE
BEEN REPORTED ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY WERE FIERCE CLASHES TOOK
PLACE THIS MORNING STARTING AROUND 0200, AND WHICH ARE CONTINUING NOW
IN CERTAIN AREAS.

   COPREFA REPORTS THE DEATH OF 14 GUERILLAS NEAR TEJUTLA. ACCORDING
TO THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN, 14 GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH
TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IN CHALATENANGO. THE BULLETIN ALSO
REPORTS THAT IMPORTANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED FROM THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS.

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 26 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACCORDING TO
THE PACT SIGNED TODAY, A BILATERAL COMMISSION THAT WILL BE CREATED
SOON WILL DISCUSS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP WILL BE
DEMOBILIZED.

   M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE ORGANIZATION,
WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE THAN 600 MEMBERS, WILL NOT TURN IN ITS WEAPONS
TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, POSSIBLY THE RED
CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 IS CALLING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "EL MEJICANO," HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND WILL
SOON BE CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, THE
COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE THAT
IMPORTANT ARRESTS WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO
NOT KNOW IF WE WILL CATCH RODRIGUEZ GACHA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HEADS OF
THE FEARSOME MEDELLIN CARTEL, AN ORGANIZATION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
THAT, ALONG WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI, IS ACCUSED OF
SUPPLYING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT IS CONSUMED IN THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE TWO MOST WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   YESTERDAY, A JUDGE ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF FREDDY
RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEJICANO," FOR THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF
WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA,
CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT BOTH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE IN
COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING REPORTS THAT THEY HAD REPORTEDLY
MOVED THEIR BASES OF OPERATION TO PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   FINALLY, IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, A TOURIST CENTER ON THE CARIBBEAN
COAST, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL, KILLING TWO PEOPLE.

   THE ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH OVER 70 BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH.  


DEV-MUC3-0524 (UMASS)

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IN A NEW ACTION ATTRIBUTED TO THE
DRUG TRAFFICKING RINGS OPERATING IN BOGOTA, A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB
PARTIALLY DESTROYED A SECONDARY SCHOOL LOCATED IN A POPULOUS SOUTHERN
BOGOTA NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE SAN IGNACIO
DE LOYOLA SCHOOL, LOCATED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM A POLICE STATION.

   AUTHORITIES SAID THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH IT
RESULTED IN LOSSES AMOUNTING TO MILLIONS.

   THE DYNAMITE ATTACK, THE 41ST IN BOGOTA DURING THIS MONTH, OCCURRED
ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER ANOTHER EXPLOSION DESTROYED ONE STORE OF A
SUPERMARKET CHAIN.

   NUMEROUS THREATS SAYING THAT BOMBS HAD BEEN PLANTED IN SCHOOLS HAVE
BEEN REPORTED IN THE "WAR" THAT THE DRUG CARTELS HAVE DECLARED IN
REPRISAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENSE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM.


DEV-MUC3-0525 (UMASS)

   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 27 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [BARCO] SOME OF THE
ARRESTED PERSONS ARE EXTRADITABLE.  THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST
TERRORISM, AND THE TERRORISTS CANNOT HIDE FOREVER.

   THIRD, MUCH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA, ITS DEMOCRACY, ITS
PEOPLE, AND ITS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOBILIZED.  COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER
SEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND
NEVER WILL BE.

   NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE
WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.  THE WORLD HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A
PROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED.

   FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS
CONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS.  MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS
HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED.  TWO OF
THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN
HAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.  THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
SECURITY HAS IDENTIFIED 110 PERSONS WHO FORM PART OF A NARCOTERRORIST
NETWORK.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP.

   FIFTH, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THE TERRORISTS'
COUNTEROFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE
STILL CAPABLE OF CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THIS HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT BY
THE EXPLOSIVES THEY HAVE PLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND WHO HAVE
BEEN INJURED, AND THE FIRES THEY HAVE PRODUCED.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FRUSTRATE MANY ATTACKS.
CRIMINALS WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.  FOR
EXAMPLE, IN MEDELLIN, 35 CRIMINALS WHO WERE COORDINATING WITH THE
TERRORIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.

   SIXTH, DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPABILITIES HAVE DECREASED.  NOW THERE IS
MUCH LESS COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER WORLD MARKETS. IT
IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES
AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO DIMINISH
AND CONTROL DRUG CONSUMPTION.  IF THERE WERE NO ADDICTS IN THOSE
COUNTRIES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THIS IS NOT THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED
IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE
TO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE
BUSINESS WOULD VANISH.

   IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID
NOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG
COULD NOT BE PRODUCED.

   IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO
MUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.  [CONTINUED]

THE 39 FORMER GN [NATIONAL GUARD] MEMBERS NOW IN JAIL WILL NOT BE
RELEASED UNTIL THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN HONDURAS ARE
DEMOBILIZED.  COMMANDER NUNEZ DEMANDED THAT THE CONTRAS RELEASE MORE
THAN 1,000 NICARAGUANS THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED AND STOP MURDERING
CIVILIANS.  HE SAID THAT THE 39 FORMER GN MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED
WHEN THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS DEMOBILIZED IN HONDURAS, AS WAS AGREED
WITH THE 21 NICARAGUAN POLITICAL PARTIES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [NUNEZ] THE 39 FORMER SOMOZIST ARMY MEMBERS, WHO

QUOTE HUMANITARIAN UNQUOTE REASONS, ARE GOING TO STAY IN PRISON AND
WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST [PARDON LIST THAT INCLUDES 457
PRISONERS APPROVED BY THE NICARAGUA LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ON 26
SEPTEMBER].  LIKEWISE, THE REST OF THE CONTRA PRISONERS, WHO ARE NOT
ON THIS LIST, WILL ALSO REMAIN IN PRISON.  THEY WILL REMAIN THERE
UNTIL WE HAVE HAVE CLEAR, DEFINITE INDICATIONS FROM THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND THE MERCENARIES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COMPLY WITH
AGREEMENTS.  THEY WILL STAY IN PRISON UNTIL WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE WORD
RECONCILIATION TO BE CHANGED INTO DEMAGOGUERY.  THIS WORD HAS REAL
MEANING.  WE ARE WILLING TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENTS AND HAVE EVIDENCED
OUR WILLINGNESS WITH GESTURES OF GENEROSITY.  WE ARE NOT ASKING THE
CONTRAS TO BE GENEROUS.  WE ARE ASKING THE CONTRAS TO COMPLY WITH THE
TELA AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN HONDURAS.  WE ARE ALSO ASKING FOR COMPLIANCE
WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THE
NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDANAPPED BY THE
CONTRAS BE RETURNED, AND THAT THEY STOP THEIR ATTACKS AND MURDERS THAT
EVEN NOW -- ALTHOUGH SOME POLITICIANS ARE BLIND TO THIS --
CONTINUE. [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IN A FIRST RULING, CRIMINAL JUDGE
62 OF RIONEGRO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, HAS
ACQUITTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ
GACHA OF CHARGES OF MASTERMINDING THE MURDER OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
CARLOS MAURO HOYOS AND THE KIDNAPPING OF BOGOTA CITY MAYOR ANDRES
PASTRANA.

   THE RULING WAS ISSUED ON THE NIGHT OF 25 SEPTEMBER AND REVEALED ON
26 SEPTEMBER.

   HOYOS WAS KIDNAPPED ON 25 JANUARY 1988 AND WAS FOUND DEAD 8 HOURS
LATER NEAR THE MEDELLIN AIRPORT.  PASTRANA WAS KIDNAPPED ON 22 JANUARY
1988 BUT WAS RESCUED BY THE ARMY 3 DAYS LATER.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" CLAIMED CREDIT AT THE TIME FOR THESE TWO
ACTIONS.

   IN HIS FIRST RULING, JUDGE FRANCISCO CARDENAS SAID "THERE IS NOT
SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OR EVIDENCE" FOR LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE MAIN CHIEFTAINS OF THE MEDELLIN DRUG CARTEL, TO
THE CRIMES.  THE EXTRADITION OF THE DRUGPINS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT.

   THE PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE HAS APPEALED JUDGE CARDENAS' RULING
BEFORE THE SUPERIOR TRIBUNAL OF MEDELLIN, WHICH WILL SOON ISSUE A
PRONOUNCEMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE COURT RULING.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THE HEAVILY ARMED AND UNIDENTIFIED
INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE HOTEL LOBBY WHERE THE THREE EUROPEANS WERE

COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE HAVE ARRESTED 30 CRIMINALS WHO BELONG TO A
BAND OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN THE CONFLICTIVE MIDDLE MAGDALENA
AREA OF THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL REGION.

   AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY
(DAS) -- THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT ADVISES COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- SAYS THAT 15 OF THOSE ARRESTED ARE
IMPLICATED IN MURDERS.

   IN ADDITION, THE DAS MANAGED TO DISMANTLE FOUR GROUPS OF HIRED
ASSASSINS KNOWN AS "THE COCKROACHES, "THE PLATEAUS," "THE SMUDGED
ONES," AND "DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS" (MAS).

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMY HAS REPORTED THAT NINE PRIVATELY-OWNED, LIGHT
AIRCRAFT USED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE CONFISCATED DURING VARIOUS
OPERATIONS CONDUCTED THIS WEEK.  THE AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO

   THE TWO OPERATIONS ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG

   LA PAZ, 28 SEP 89 (LA RED PANAMERICANA) -- [TEXT] BOLIVIAN
PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS STATED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS ADEQUATE
ASSISTANCE TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS.  HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A
LEADER LIKE NORIEGA TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH U.S. REPORTERS, PRESIDENT PAZ YESTERDAY
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING
AND THE ERADICATION OF COCA CROPS. THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE
EFFORTS MADE BY THE BOLIVIAN PEOPLE TO OVERCOME HYPERINFLATION OF MORE
THAN 27,000 PERCENT. HE SAID THAT INFLATION IS PREDICTED TO REACH 12
PERCENT DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION.

   PAZ ZAMORA STATED THAT THE HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES MUST PAY
ATTENTION TO NATIONS SUCH AS BOLIVIA THAT FACE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC
SITUATIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. HE
CRITICIZED THE BEHAVIOR OF WORLD POWERS, AND HE SAID THAT SUCH
BEHAVIOR MUST BE CHANGED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PAZ ZAMORA] WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE BEHAVING, MAINTAINING
CERTAIN SADOMASOCHISTIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS.
[END RECORDING]

   THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT TRIED TO MAKE THE U.S. PRESS UNDERSTAND THE
INDIFFERENCE THAT CERTAIN COUNTRIES, NAMELY THE ECONOMIC POWERS, SHOW
TOWARD BOLIVIA.

   TO EXPLAIN HIS REMARKS, HE SAID THAT PERHAPS A GENERAL SHOULD
ASSUME POWER, AND MILITARY FORCES SHOULD BESIEGE THE U.S. EMBASSY, AND
A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOULD BE MURDERED TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE
WORLD.

   PAZ ZAMORA DEMANDED GREATER UNDERSTANDING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPOSE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING
ECONOMIC STABILITY. DOES A WAR KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN AN ECONOMIC
ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM, THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT ASKED. HE INVITED THE U.S.
REPORTERS TO REVIEW THE STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN
THE SALVADORAN WAR AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN BOLIVIA
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.

   PRESIDENT PAZ HAS STATED THAT THE FACT THAT BOLIVIA IS A COCA-
PRODUCING COUNTRY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE U.S. TREATMENT OF THE
MATTER. HE SAID THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING DEMANDS
ACTION TO CONTROL CONSUMPTION. HE ADDED THAT BOLIVIA IS NOT RECEIVING
THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS RESULTING
FROM THE REDUCTION OF COCA PRODUCTION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PAZ] AN ANTINARCOTICS PROGRAM FOR BOLIVIA SIMILAR
TO THAT IMPLEMENTED IN COLOMBIA WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE [END
RECORDING].

   HE DEMANDED REAL ALTERNATIVES FOR WORK AND PRODUCTION FOR BOLIVIAN
PEASANTS. HE SAID THAT UNTIL THIS IS ACHIEVED, THE MISTAKES OF THE
PAST WILL BE REPEATED.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S VILLALOBOS BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTED] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [VILLALOBOS] WE ARE
CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFORT TO STOP FASCISM AND BRING ABOUT A GENUINE
DEMOCRACY.  THE BASIS FOR A NEGOTIATION IN EL SALVADOR SHOULD BE THAT
DEMOCRACY PRECEDES PEACE.  OUR COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT WE ARE SEARCHING
FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.  WE MENTION THEM IN THAT ORDER BECAUSE IF WE
WERE TO SEEK PEACE FIRST, AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS, WE WOULD HAVE THE
PEACE OF DEATH.

   [REPORTER] YOU REFERRED TO COMBATANTS AND THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.
HOWEVER, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT
OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCIST REGIME; THAT IS, THE FMLN MAIMED.
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THEIR PLIGHT AND ATTITUDE?

   [VILLALOBOS] THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT INVOLVING
INDIVIDUALS WHO WAGE IMPORTANT BATTLES WITHOUT WEAPONS IS QUITE
ADMIRABLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE STRUGGLE OF THE WAR MAIMED IS TWICE AS
ADMIRABLE.  THEY ARE NOT ONLY WAGING A BATTLE WITHOUT WEAPONS, BUT
WITH THEIR MUTILATED BODIES.

   THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT IS EXPERIENCING VERY TRYING MOMENTS.  IT IS
FACING REPRESSION.  THIS SHOWS THE REGIME AS IT REALLY IS.  THE MAIMED
HAVE ALSO DEALT A VERY IMPORTANT BLOW: THEY HAVE EXPOSED THE BRUTALITY
AND STUPIDITY OF ARMY LEADERS WHO SET UP ANTIRIOT CORDONS, SURROUNDED
THE CATHEDRAL, AND THREATENED PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO WALK OR ARE
MISSING A LIMB [WORDS INDISTINCT].  IT IS REALLY A HEROIC STRUGGLE
MUCH LIKE THE ONES THAT MANY MAIMED COMRADES HAVE WAGED FROM THEIR
JAILS.  THEY HAVE OPENED THE WAY FOR OTHER COMRADES TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   I THINK THIS IS TO BE ADDED TO THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE'S
FORCES WHO HAVE TAKEN UP THE BANNER OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, EVEN THE
WAR-DISABLED, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR EFFORT WITH THEIR SACRIFICE.

   BOGOTA, 29 SEP 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IT WAS REPORTED TODAY IN BOGOTA
THAT THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED AN APPEAL PRESENTED BY
BEATRIZ RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA'S LAWYER, WHO WANTED HER ARREST FOR
EXTRADITION PURPOSES CANCELLED.  RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA IS SAID TO BE AN
IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL CONNECTION.

   RODRIGUEZ ZUNIGA WAS ARRESTED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN CARTAGENA AND,
WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S CONSENT, COULD BE THE SECOND PERSON
EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS THAT STARTED A MONTH AND A HALF AGO.

   ON 6 SEPTEMBER THE ALLEGED "FINANCIAL HEAD" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL,
EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, WAS SENT TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER
WASHINGTON PRESENTED DOCUMENTATION TO HAVE HIM TRIED IN AN ATLANTA
COURT.

   DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTARTION INVESTIGATIONS REPORT THAT MARTINEZ
ROMERO WAS A KEY PERSON IN THE "WASHING" OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION
THE MAFIA OBTAINED FROM THE COCAINE BUSINESS.

   THE DRUG "BARONS" HAVE PUBLICLY THREATENED TO MURDER 10 JUDGES FOR
EACH COLOMBIAN EXRADITED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.

   SINCE MARTINEZ ROMERO WAS SENT TO ATLANTA THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS
OF DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT COLOMBIAN CITIES.  THESE ATTACKS ARE
THE COCAINE CARTELS' DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THEM.

   BOGOTA, 24 SEP 89 (EL TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] WHAT
IS THE TRUTH OVER THE SIGNING OF THE DECREES?  WERE THEY SIGNED ONLY
AFTER THE ATTACK ON LUIS CARLOS GALAN?

   [DE GREIFF] THE DECREES WERE BEING STUDIED SINCE NOON ON THE DAY OF
HIS DEATH.  IT HAD BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK.  THE MAGISTRATE AND THE
COLONEL HAD BEEN MURDERED; GALAN WAS MURDERED THAT EVENING.  THERE WAS
MUCH DISCUSSION OVER THE DRAFTS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ATTACK ON
GALAN HURRIED THINGS UP.

   IN THE CASE OF THE EXTRADITION DECREE, WE WERE ALL AWARE THAT IT
WAS NOT A POPULAR MEASURE.  PHILOSOPHICALLY, MOST MINISTERS DID NOT
LIKE THE IDEA OF COLOMBIANS BEING TRIED ABROAD.  THERE WAS MUCH LEGAL
DISCUSSION, NOT ONLY TO DO WITH THIS CASE, BUT ALSO OVER THE NEW
MEASURES CONCERNING RAIDS, SEIZURES, AND ARRESTS.

   HOWEVER, FINALLY THERE WAS A GREAT DETERMINATION TO GIVE THE
COUNTRY ANSWERS.

   [REPORTER] THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT PROBLEMS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE
EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [DE GREIFF] WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THESE MEASURES ARE NOT AGAINST
A GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST VIOLENCE.  EXTRADITION HAS BEEN A VERY
TOUGH MEASURE FOR EVERYONE.  THE INCONVENIENCES AND THE LEGALITY OF
THIS DECREE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE REACTIONS AGAINST IT, WERE
DISCUSSED A GREAT DEAL.  IT CAN BE THAT PART OF THE VIOLENCE GENERATED
HAS BEEN DUE TO THE EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [REPORTER] IS IT POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AS A WAY OF ENDING THE COUNTRY'S VIOLENCE?

   [DE GREIFF] THE GOVERNMENT SAID NO TO THE DIALOGUE, BUT WE MUST
WAIT AND SEE HOW EVENTS DEVELOP.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A GOVERNMENT'S
DECISION CAN BE STRICT, BECAUSE SITUATIONS DO CHANGE.  THE PRESIDENT
HAS SAID THAT DIALOGUE IS IMPOSSIBLE.  YOU NEVER KNOW, THINGS MAY
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

   ANYWAY, IN COLOMBIA PRACTICALLY NO WARS HAVE ENDED, BECAUSE IN
NEARLY ALL WARS AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED.

   [REPORTER] BUT IF COLOMBIA HOLDS A DIALOGUE, THE WORLD'S DOORS WILL
PROBABLY CLOSE ON COLOMBIA.

   [DE GREIFF] LOOK, IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
EXTRADITION AND I SAID IT WAS NOT POPULAR, THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO
SOLVE THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM.  IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
STANCE, BUT IF IT IS DECIDED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEN THIS WOULD BE A
SOVEREIGN COLOMBIAN DECISION.  OBVIOUSLY, IF THE POSITION CHANGES A
BAD IMPRESSION WILL BE GIVEN.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT LOST ITS
SOVEREIGNTY.

   [REPORTER] THE INTERNATINAL PRESS FEELS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH
YOUR RESIGNATION.  ONE MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU BECAME A SYMBOL FOR
THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHEN YOU TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON.

   [DE GREIFF] I HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 22 SEPTEMBER AND I TOLD
THEM THAT MY RESIGNATION WAS NOT MONICA DE GREIFF'S POSITION, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT'S.  I TOLD THEM I WAS STAYING IN THE COUNTRY, AND I
EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THE MINISTERS HERE REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS UNTIL
THE PRESIDENT DECIDES OTHERWISE.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL MONICA DE GREIFF DO?

   [DE GREIFF] I AM GOING TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN RETURN.  I
AM GOING TO HELP ERNESTO SAMPER'S CAMPAIGN.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT
WORKING FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT POST HAS GIVEN YOU THE GREATEST SATISFACTION?

   [DE GREIFF] WHEN I WAS AT THE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY. IT WAS
FASCINATING.  I HAD TWO VERY GOOD BOSSES: GUILLERMO PERRY AND OSCAR
MEJIA.  I WORKED IN DELIGHTFUL HARMONY WITH A GROUP OF GOOD PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE THAT MINING AND HYDROCARBONS IS THE SECTOR THAT HAS ENJOYED
THE GREATEST PROGRESS UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR FINAL FEELING UPON LEAVING THE MINISTRY?

   [DE GREIFF] EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.  I HAVE BEEN SPARED
FROM MANY BORING THINGS.  I HAVE NOT HAD TO SIGN EXTRADITION ORDERS OR
THINGS LIKE THAT.  WITHOUT REALIZING IT, I HAVE BEEN SPARED OF TIRING
THINGS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER A "TOTAL AMNESTY" TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).  IN EXCHANGE, IT WILL ASK THE
INSURGENTS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE, JUSTICE
MINISTER OSCAR SANTAMARIA ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   IN STATEMENTS TO A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION, SANTAMARIA SAID THE
PROPOSAL WILL BE OFFICIALLY PRESENTED TO THE REBEL LEADERS DURING THE
SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH WILL BE HELD 16 - 17 OCTOBER IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.

   SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE
COMMISSION SPOKESMAN, MET FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE FMLN LEADERS ON
13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO CITY.

   ON 21 SEPTEMBER, DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS, FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THE 9 YEARS OF WAR, SAID THAT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
ARMY TROOPS, AS DEMANDED BY THE REBELS, IS FEASIBLE.  HE SAID THE
GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A DOCUMENT ON THE CEASE-FIRE THAT IT WILL
PRESENT AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING.

   DURING THE MEXICO MEETING THE PARTIES IN CONFLICT AGREED TO HOLD
MEETINGS TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAR, WHICH HAS RESULTED
IN 70,000 DEATHS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD.

   DESPITE THE DIALOGUE, THE GUERRILLAS THIS WEEK LAUNCHED ONE OF THE
MOST VIOLENT MILITARY CAMPAIGNS YET, WHICH EVEN AFFECTED SAN SALVADOR.
THIS GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN IS IN RESPONSE TO "INCREASING REPRESSION AND
ASSASSINATIONS" OF LABOR LEADERS.

   THE ONLY ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE COSTA RICA MEETING WILL BE
THE CEASE-FIRE.  THE TWO PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT AN
AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.

   IN ADDITION TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ARMY TROOPS, THE
REBELS PROPOSED IN MEXICO THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BE REORGANIZED AND
THAT A PROSECUTOR [FISCAL] BE APPOINTED AS A RESULT OF A CONSENSUS
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES.  IN RESPONSE TO A
QUESTION ABOUT THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE BY THE
REBELS, SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE ARE AT A STAGE WHERE THE TENSION LEVEL IS
DECLINING.  WE HAVE FOUND POINTS OF AGREEMENT, AND WE AND WILL HONOR
THEM."

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 SEP 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] WE REPORT TO YOU THE
FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE
SEARCH FOR A JUST AND LASTING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   1.  WE NOTE WITH DEEP CONCERN THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING
INCREASE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN WAR NORMS VIOLATIONS BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES.  THESE VIOLATIONS CAN BE OBSERVED IN
THE REPRESSION OF DEMONSTRATIONS, TORTURES, MURDERS, ARRESTS -- MORE
THAN 400 IN THE PAST MONTH -- DISAPEARANCES, AND IN THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFUSAL TO ALLOW MAIMED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] MEMBERS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THIS
NORM IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA CONVENTION, AND THIS IS AN AGREEMENT
THAT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS SITUATION HAS
BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RESOLUTION ISSUED BY THE
SUBCOMMISSION [30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] PERIOD IN AUGUST 1989.
MR CRISTIANI SAID THIS RESOLUTION WAS NOT TRUTHFUL.

   2. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN AND MR CRISTIANI HIMSELF HAVE REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE DEPENDS ON THE FMLN'S HALTING
HOSTILITIES.  THIS PRESENTS A UNILATERAL PLAN THAT HAS NOT BEEN AGREED
UPON POLITICALLY, MILITARILY, OR OPERATIONALLY.

   IN CONTRAST TO THESE STATEMENTS, WHEN THE FMLN UNILATERALLY
DECLARED A TRUCE RECENTLY, MR CRISTIANI, OFFICIALS IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION, AND MILITARY COMMANDERS STATED THAT THESE FMLN
MEASURES WERE PROPAGANDISTIC AND THAT THE TRUCE WAS NOT RESPECTED.
THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKING OF
THE TRUCE.

   THESE EVENTS GIVE US ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR STATING THAT A DEFINITE
AND UNCONDITIONAL HALT TO HOSTILITIES IS UNREALISTIC AND UNFEASIBLE.

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SPANISH) -- [SPEECH] [BARCO] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BARCO] RECENT EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR
COLOMBIA HAVE GREATLY ENCOURAGED US IN THESE TRYING TIMES.  WE ARE NOW
LIVING IN DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT THE SITUATION IS NO LESS CRITICAL THAN
THE ONE THAT LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

   A NEW WORLD WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED BY AN AGGRESSOR THAT DOES NOT
RESPECT THE TRADITIONAL RULES OF WAR OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.  THE
AGGRESSOR IS A PERNICIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS
GREAT POWER AND RESOURCES AND THAT IS NOURISHED BY ILLEGAL REVENUES
GENERATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   AS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE: THE ILLEGAL
USE OF AND TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS TODAY IS SEEN AS A SOCIAL PLAGUE THAT
AFFECTS BOTH INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  ALTHOUGH
EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS SCOURGE HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS,
STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MONETARY VALUE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS GREATER
THAN THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL TRADE AND IS ONLY SURPASSED BY ARMS
TRAFFICKING.  IT IS CERTAINLY WORRISOME TO SEE THAT MANKIND IS SO
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING DEGRADATION AND DEATH.  END OF THE
SECRETARY GENERAL'S STATEMENT.

   THE MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL CARTELS WERE BORN IN VARIOUS
COUNTRIES, AND MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE COLOMBIANS.
ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MY
COUNTRY, I MUST CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE COLOMBIANS IN NAME ONLY.  THEY
ARE REALLY JUST INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES WHO HAVE NO HOME.  COLOMBIA IS
NOT THEIR HOMELAND! [APPLAUSE]

   I AM ALSO HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE CRUDE
REALITY OF THIS WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  COLOMBIA IS ON THE
FRONTLINE OF THIS BATTLE.  FOR US IT IS NOT A WAR OF WORDS.  MANY
COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRM COMMITMENT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, ONE OF THE
MOST PRESTIGIOUS POLITICAL LEADERS IN MY COUNTRY, WAS ASSASSINATED.
HIS DEATH HAS CONSOLIDATED EVEN MORE THE NATION'S WILL AND HAS DRAWN
THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE
DIED OVER THE YEARS -- AS HE DID -- AS VICTIM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.
THAT LONG LIST INCLUDES 12 MAGISTRATES OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A JUSTICE MINISTER.  PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN,
JUDGES, MAYORS, JOURNALISTS, THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND
COLOMBIAN CITIZENS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR DEMOCRACY.

   LAST MONTH, AFTER ANNOUNCING EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, WHICH WERE DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE STATE OF SIEGE, DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED
THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS. [CONTINUED]

REPORTED TODAY THAT A SPANIARD, A FRENCHMAN, AND AN ITALIAN, KIDNAPPED
IN TECUN UMAN ON 27 SEPTEMBER, HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITHIN THE PAST FEW
HOURS.

   SPANIARD JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, FRENCHMAN ROBERTO LISANDY, AND
ITALIAN DINO ROSSY, WHO WERE STAYING AT A TECUN UMAN HOTEL, WERE
KIDNAPPED BY ARMED MEN WHO TOOK THEM TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE.

   AFTER THEY WERE RELEASED, THE THREE EUROPEANS WENT TO THE REGIONAL
POLICE STATION AND GAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE
KIDNAPPERS.

   MARTINEZ TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS HELD THEM IN A DARK
ROOM AND QUESTIONED THEM.

   THE THREE MEN WERE TAKEN TO A MEDICAL CENTER AFTER THEIR RELEASE
AND, ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL REPORT, SUFFERED NO WOUNDS.

   OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT MARTINEZ AND LISANDY DO BUSINESS IN TECUN
UMAN AND HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS.  ROSSY WAS
ENJOYING HIS VACATION HERE, WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THE PERSONS WHO KIDNAPPED THE THREE MEN
GOT THEM DRUNK BEFORE RELEASING THEM SO THAT THEY WOULD LOSE TRACK OF
TIME AND BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HELD CAPTIVE.

   BOGOTA, 25 SEP 89 (EL SIGLO) -- [EDITORIAL] [GERMAN ISAZA ROBLEDO]
[TEXT] THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES MEANS NATIONS HAVE THE
ABILITY TO SETTLE THEIR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS BY THEMSELVES.  BASED ON
THIS VIEW, SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST OUSTANDING DEMOCRATS AND
DUPES DENOUNCED FOREIGN MILITARY AID TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING, A
SCOURGE THAT BECAME AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM A LONG TIME AGO AND IS
WEAKENING COLOMBIAN SOVEREIGNTY.

   I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOW MOST OPPOSED TO THE PRESENCE
OF U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS AND EXPERTS ARE THOSE WHO REGARD THIS
PRESENCE AS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE ARMED ORGANIZATIONS THEY PROMOTE
AND THAT ARE TRAINED BY LIBYAN, BRITISH, CUBAN, AND ISRAELI EXPERTS.

   IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR
THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE.  HOWEVER, WE LOST OUR SOVEREIGNTY LONG AGO
AND TO REGAIN IT WE MUST ACCEPT ALL THE AID THE HONEST INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY CAN OFFER US.

   SOVEREIGNTY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEANS ADOPTING DECISIONS BASED ON
THE NEEDS OR PREFERENCES OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  THAT STOPPED
HAPPENING IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN TO INTIMIDATE
AND DESTROY THE LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE.  HOW CAN WE TALK
OF SOVEREIGNTY WHEN WE SEE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN PREY TO
TERRORISM; THAT THEY ARE LIVING AND DYING ENSLAVED BY DAILY BOMBINGS
AND LIES; THAT THEY ARE GOVERNING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THREATS; THAT
THEY HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN A HOME IMPRISONED BY FEAR?  IT IS ABSURD TO
TALK OF A TRULY SOVEREIGN STATE WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT SEVERAL OF THE
COUNTRY'S TOP POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL
ACTIVITIES.  AN ACT OF SOVEREIGNTY -- ONE IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH
SUBJUGATION -- WOULD BE TO STRIP OURSELVES OF SO MUCH VAIN PRIDE AND
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ARE WEAK AND NEED ALL THE HELP OFFERED BY
ANYONE WHOSE INTENTIONS ARE BASED ON THE LAW.  MOREOVER, IT IS IRONIC
THAT SEVERAL OF THOSE WHO ARE CLAMORING FOR "THE DEFENSE OF
SOVEREIGNTY" ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE NOW ASKING THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
TO EXPLAIN THE CANCELLATION OF VISAS.  IS IT NOT A MATTER OF NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY TO DECIDE WHO CAN AND CANNOT ENTER THAT COUNTRY?

   I AM REMINDED OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF FOOD AND MEDICINE
DONATED TO COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE ARMERO CATASTROPHE THAT ROTTED IN
THE COUNTRY'S CUSTOMS WAREHOUSES.  ARMERO IS THE BURIAL GROUND FOR
30,000 COLOMBIANS AND THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY OF THOUSANDS MORE.
DESPITE THE REGRETTABLE END THAT THIS AID MET IN SO MANY WAREHOUSES,
NOBODY OPPOSED INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THAT CORNER OF TOLIMA
DEPARTMENT.

   THE WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BURY US.  LET US STRUGGLE FOR
SOVEREINGTY AND ACCEPT THE ADVICE OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, OR WE
WILL END UP ROTTING IN A WAREHOUSE FILLED WITH WHITE POWDER.

   BOGOTA, 1 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION
ARMY [ELN] GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHICH KIDNAPPED SPANISH BUSINESSMAN
PABLO MARTIN BERROCAL ALMOST 2 MONTHS AGO IN QUITO, IS DEMANDING 1
BILLION PESETAS RANSOM FOR HIS RELEASE.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE REBEL GROUP, THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS NOT JOINED
THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, TOLD EFE THAT NEGOTIATIONS
FOR HIS RELEASE ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN AN UNIDENTIFIED BORDER TOWN.

   COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, DISGUISED AS POLICEMEN, KIDNAPPED THE
55-YEAR-OLD BUSINESSMAN LAST 9 AUGUST AT THE HOTEL WHERE BERROCAL WAS
STAYING IN THE DOWNTOWN SECTION OF THE ECUADORAN CAPITAL.  THE SAME
SOURCES STATED THAT BERROCAL'S WIFE, BLANCA PARADELA, AND A PARTNER
ARE IN COLOMBIA NEGOTIATING FOR THE BUSINESSMAN'S RELEASE DIRECTLY
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ELN, A REBEL GROUP LED BY FORMER SPANISH
PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ,

   THE ELN HAS NOT ANNOUNCED THE MOTIVE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.  SOURCES
CONSULTED WITH BY EFE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COLOMBIAN
REBEL GROUP HAS ONLY ECONOMIC MOTIVES.

   BERROCAL OWNS A BULLFIGHTING RING IN QUITO AND HE PARTICIPATES WITH
HIS BROTHER, BULLFIGHTING BUSINESSMAN LUIS MARTIN BERROCAL, IN LA
SEPULVEDANA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY.

   NEITHER THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE NOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS), CHARGED WITH THE COUNTRY'S SECRET
INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON MARTIN BERROCAL OR HIS ALLEGED
PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

   EFE HAS LEARNED THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF MARTIN BERROCAL, WHO WENT
TO BOGOTA IN MID-SEPTEMBER, DID NOT GET IN CONTACT WITH THE COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THIS CITY.

   THE ELN, A MARXIST-LENINIST ORIENTED GROUP THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED
IN ARMED STRUGGLE FOR 25 YEARS, HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY ITS ATTACKS
ON THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE AND FREQUENT KIDNAPPINGS OF NEWSMEN
AND POLITICIANS OF THE COUNTRY.

[TEXT] ISRAELI ANTITERROR SECURITY INSTRUCTORS IN PERU HAVE BEEN
DECLARED PERSONA NON GRATA AND ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER PERU.
THIS WAS LEARNED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO ISRAELI
COMPANIES DEALING WITH THE SALE OF SECURITY KNOW-HOW.

   THE LONDON OBSERVER, QUOTING PERUVIAN CONGRESS MEMBERS, REPORTED
THAT EVIDENCE CONCERNING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF A
RIGHT-WING TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN LIMA DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILES
OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION PROBING ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN PERU.
OUR CORRESPONDENT HANAN 'AZRAN HAS MORE DETAILS:

   THE REPORTS IN THE LONDON OBSERVER APPARENTLY STEM FROM LEFT-WING
CIRCLES AND PERUVIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS.  THE MOST PROMINENT GROUP IS
THE SHINING PATH, A GUERRILLA GROUP AIMING TO OVERTHROW THE REGIME.
THESE CIRCLES CONTEND THAT ISRAELIS TRAIN WHAT THEY TERM THE
RIGHT-WING DEATH, OR TERROR, SQUADS.  THEY APPARENTLY REFER TO THE
RODRIGO FRANCO COMMANDO UNITS, TO WHICH THE LIQUIDATION OF GUERRILLA
MEMBERS AND OF OPPONENTS TO THE REGIME IS ATTRIBUTED.

   POLITICAL CIRCLES IN JERUSALEM HAVE SAID THAT THESE CLAIMS OF
ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF DEATH SQUADS ARE GROUNDLESS.

   ISRAELI COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN MILITARY TRAINING AND IN
MANEUVERS IN PERU.  ISRAELI EXPERTS HAVE SET UP THE PERUVIAN ARMY'S
ANTITERROR SQUAD.  ONE OF THE SQUAD'S FOUNDERS WAS GABI KOHEN, A
FORMER ISRAEL POLICE ANTITERROR UNIT COMMANDER.  GABI KOHEN WAS A
PARTNER IN THE DAT COMPANY, WHICH OFFERED SIMILAR TRAINING AND
INSTRUCTION SERVICES TO ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

   DAT OPERATED IN PERU WITH THE PERMIT OF SIBAT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY
DEFENSE SALES DEPARTMENT.  ONE MEMBER OF THE COMPANY WAS A SENIOR
BORDER POLICE OFFICER, FORMER BORDER POLICE COMMANDER TZVI BAR, WHO
RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY AFTER A SHORT PERIOD, TURNING TO OTHER
ENTERPRISES.

   ONE COMPANY WITH DIVERSE OPERATIONS IN PERU WAS THE ISDS OWNED BY
LEO GLASER, ALSO AN IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] ELITE UNIT GRADUATE.
ISDS HAD PERMANENT OFFICES IN LIMA HEADED BY RAN GAZIT, WHO LATER
OPENED A BUSINESS OF HIS OWN ELSEWHERE.  THE COMPANY HAD DEFENSE
MINISTRY APPROVAL FOR ITS WORK IN PERU.  ACCORDING TO ITS DIRECTORS,
IT TRAINED SECURITY GUARDS FOR CIVILIAN BUSINESSES ONLY, INCLUDING THE
USE OF FIREARMS AND PROTECTION MEASURES.

GROUPS HOLDING THE SAME POLICIES THAT FAILED IN CHILE AT THE END OF
THE 1960'S AND THE BEGINNING OF THE 1970'S WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH
THEMSELVES IN OTHER PLACES.

   NOW WE ARE WITNESSING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ILLUSIONS AND OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF TOTALITARIAN AND COLLECTIVIST SYSTEMS. IT SEEMS THAT
PEACE IS BEING CONSOLIDATED.  THE WORLD POWERS HAVE AGREED TO WORK FOR
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE RATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE WORLD IS
BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT.

   OUR MODERN KNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESOURCES HAVE
OVERCOME BORDERS AND LIMITATIONS.  THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE PROBLEMS, THEREFORE, ARE A CHALLENGE
FOR WORLD COOPERATION AND THIS ORGANIZATION.

   ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
TODAY IS THE DRAFTING OF EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.
WE SUPPORT COLOMBIA FOR ITS COURAGE TO FACE THE POWERFUL CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE USING THE NATION FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.  CHILE
HAS IMPLEMENTED A STRICT PREVENTIVE PROGRAM TO CONTROL THE MOST
DANGEROUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PROBLEM.  WE ARE NOT A DRUG PRODUCING
COUNTRY.  WE ARE VICTIMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   IN ONE OF ITS FIRST DECISIONS ON THE PROBLEM, IN SEPTEMBER 1973,
THE GOVERNMENT EXPELLED A GROUP OF FOREIGN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO HAD
ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN NORTHERN CHILE, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PREVAILING POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CRISIS.  WE ARE CONVINCED THAT
COUNTRIES CANNOT FIGHT THE PROBLEM ALONE.  THE WORLD HAS DECLARED WAR
ON DRUGS.  WE MUST BE AWARE THAT TRANSITORY VICTORIES WILL NOT
ERADICATE THE PROBLEM.  ONLY WITH PROPER EDUCATION WILL WE BE ABLE TO
NURTURE THE STRENGTH OF OUR YOUTH, ALERT THEM TO THE DANGERS OF DRUG
CONSUMPTION, AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING VICTIMS.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST ASSIGN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO
IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

   WE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM FOR MANY YEARS.  TODAY WE
WANT TO REITERATE OUR REJECTION AND REPUDIATION OF TERRORISM.
CHILEANS ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO TERRORISM BECAUSE WE CONTINUOUSLY
EXPERIENCE THEIR COWARDLY AND IRRESPONSIBLE ATTACKS.  WE HAVE OFTEN
SEEN HOW SOME NATIONS RECEIVE CONFESSED TERRORISTS WHO ASK FOR
POLITICAL ASYLUM.

   IF MODERN SOCIETIES WANT TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND NARCOTERRORISM,
THEY WILL HAVE TO ACT DECISIVELY.  TERRORISTS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN
REFUGE OR PROTECTION ANYWHERE.

   SOME INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PERMITTED THE SYSTEMATIC
MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  THE
PARTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH MANIPULATION HAVE TRIED TO INCLUDE THE
LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF A NATION TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM TERRORISM AND
SUBVERSION IN THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS.  IT IS NOT
THAT WE DENY THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE.  WE CONDEMN THE GROSS
MANIPULATION OF THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  THIS MANIPULATION SHOWS
THAT THOSE PARTIES DO NOT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS THEMSELVES.  HUMAN
RIGHTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY ALL NATIONS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

   IT IS NOT FAIR TO PASS JUDGMENT ON COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE THAT HAD TO
STRUGGLE HARD TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY TERRORISM AND
SUBVERSION.  TERRORISM SET FOOT IN CHILE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF
DISRUPTION IN THE INSTITUTIONAL ORDER BETWEEN 1970 AND 1973.  THOSE
PASSING JUDGMENT MUST CONSIDER THE GENERAL SITUATION THAT PROVOKED THE
COLLAPSE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.

   IN CHILE WE HAVE BUILT A SOCIETY IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ARE
PROTECTED NOT ONLY BY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE LAW, BUT ALSO BY
THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, VALUES,
AND BELIEFS.  THOSE RIGHTS ARE ALSO PROTECTED BY TODAY'S SPIRIT OF
COEXISTENCE.

THREATENED A GENERALIZED ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

   ODILIO DELEON, 42, AN ANNOUNCER FOR RADIO CULTURAL, TOLD THE POLICE
THAT HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY IN WHICH AN ATTACK ON RADIO
STATIONS WAS THREATENED.  NO REASON FOR THE THREAT WAS GIVEN.

ASKED SOME EUROPEAN NATIONS TO ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING OF THE
COCA PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND U.S. AUTHORITIES AT WHICH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING ISSUE WILL BE DISCUSSED.

   GARCIA SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS ADDRESSED TO THE FRENCH, ITALIAN,
AND SPANISH CHIEFS OF STATE, FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, GIULIO ANDREOTTI,
AND FELIPE GONZALEZ, RESPECTIVELY.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TO FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, ALAN GARCIA
SAID THAT EUROPE MUST ATTEND THIS MEETING BECAUSE IT IS A STRONG DRUG
MARKET AND BECAUSE OF THE LINKS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AND
TERRORISTS.

   GARCIA CRITICIZED THE PLAN PROPOSED BY WILLIAM BENNETT, THE WHITE
HOUSE'S MAIN ADVISER FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AFFAIRS, ON THE GROUNDS THAT
IT "LACKS SERIOUSNESS AND IS INCONCEIVABLE." THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR
$250 MILLION IN AID FOR COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU FOR FIGHTING DRUG
TRAFFICKING IN 1990.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THIS AMOUNT IS "RIDICULOUS" IF
COMPARED WITH THE $8 BILLION THAT THE BENNETT PLAN ASSIGNS FOR
FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WITH THE U.S.
$300 BILLION MILITARY BUDGET.

   ALAN GARCIA CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES GAVE
COLOMBIA "PLANES FROM THE KOREAN WAR ERA AND OLD HELICOPTERS THAT WERE
USED HERE (IN PERU)."

   HE SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT FORM ALLIANCES WITH
GOVERNMENTS BUT WITH COCA FARMERS, AND THAT IT SHOULD IMPLEMENT
COMPREHENSIVE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING GUARANTEED SALES.

   "PERU DOES NOT HAVE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS, BUT AN AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN DISTORTED BY THE U.S. DEMAND," ALAN GARCIA
ADDED, NOTING THAT THE MOST FERTILE PERUVIAN LAND IS DEDICATED TO COCA
FARMING.

   ALAN GARCIA SAID THAT IF THE 200,000 HECTARES OF COCA FARMS IN PERU
(WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 60 PERCENT OF WORLD PRODUCTION) ARE "DRASTICALLY
ERADICATED," MORE THAN 400,000 PEASANTS WILL BE LEFT "IN ABSOLUTE
MISERY," ADDING THAT THESE PEASANTS MAY JOIN THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
OPERATING IN THE COCA PRODUCING ZONE OF ALTO HUALLAGA, IN THE
AMAZONIAN REGION.

   "IF THE UNITED STATES HAS LIVED WITH DRUG ADDICTION FOR DECADES, I
DON'T SEE WHY IT NOW WANTS TO DROP KIND OF ATOMIC BOMB ON THE HUALLAGA
ZONE," HE ADDED.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON A U.S. CHARGE THAT
GENERAL GUILLERMO ARCINIEGAS, CHIEF OF THE HUALLAGA MILITARY ZONE, HAS
USED DRUG TRAFFICKERS' MONEY TO FIGHT TERRORISTS.

   "JUST AS WE HAVE NEVER SAID THAT U.S. OFFICIALS OR POLICEMEN ARE
ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG ADDICTS, WE CANNOT TOLERATE THE CHARGE THAT
THOSE WHO FIGHT SUBVERSION IN PERU ARE ACCOMPLICES WITH DRUG
PRODUCERS," HE NOTED.

INDIVIDUALS" WHILE ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

   A MEMBER OF THE FECMAFAN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT "THE PURPOSE OF THIS
OCCUPATION IS TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
WINNER OSCAR ARIAS AND BEFORE THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD, THE
REPRESSION TO WHICH THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE
BEING SUBJECTED."

   THE FECMAFAN MEMBER ADDED THAT THE OCCUPATION IS ALSO BEING USED TO
REACH THESE GOVERNMENTS TO ASK THEM TO APPLY PRESSURE ON SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO GET HIM TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ SAID: "THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS OCCUPATION,
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS MET WITH ALL SECTORS.  THIS IS HARDLY THE
TREATMENT THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SHOWN EXTREME
CONCERN IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT."

   IN ADDITION TO AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ, CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO,
COUNSELOR CARLOTA DE LOPEZ, AND FIRST SECRETARY LUIS DE ANDA ARE
INSIDE THE 54-SQUARE-METER OFFICE, AS WELL AS 10 PERSONS WHO WERE
SEEKING VISAS.

   DE ANDA TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT HE WAS HIT ON THE LEFT HAND WHEN THE
OCCUPIERS TRIED TO OPEN HIS DESK DRAWER.

   THE DOORS TO THE EMBASSY, WHICH IS IN A 10-STORY BUILDING IN
WESTERN SAN SALVADOR, ARE CLOSED, AND THE OFFICES ARE OCCUPIED BY
WOMEN WITH WHITE SCARVES ON THEIR HEADS AND YOUTHS WHOSE FACES ARE
COVERED WITH SCARVES AND GLASSES.  FECMAFAN MEMBERS, WHO CLAIM THAT
THEY ARE NOT CARRYING WEAPONS, ARE GUARDING THE ELEVATOR AND THE DOORS
LEADING TO THE EMBASSY.

   HOWEVER, CONSUL MURILLO SAID THAT HE SAW SEVERAL YOUTHS ARMED WITH
.38-CALIBER REVOLVERS AND EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

   ACCORDING TO A FECMAFAN MEMBER, OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SOME 150
PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 500 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR MADE
TO DISAPPEAR.

   ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP SAID: "WE ARE PROTESTING THE
LIMITATION OF FREEDOMS IN EL SALVADOR.  IF WE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO
PROTEST WE ARE ARRESTED."

   THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH
HIS GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE "I AM BEING PREVENTED FROM MAKING PHONE CALLS
AND FROM LEAVING THE EMBASSY."

   THE OCCUPIERS ALLOWED FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING A PREGNANT WOMAN, TO
LEAVE THE PREMISES AND SAID THAT THEY PLANNED TO STAY IN THE EMBASSY
INDEFINITELY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 OCT 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE MEDIATION OF
ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS COULD END THE OCCUPATION BY 20
MEMBERS OF AN OPPOSITION HUMANITARIAN GROUP OF THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY
IN SAN SALVADOR IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   THE GROUP BELONGING TO THE FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND
RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, MISSING, AND MURDERED PEOPLE
(FECMAFAN) OCCUPIED THE EMBASSY ON 5 OCTOBER TO DEMAND "AN END TO THE
GOVERNMENT'S REPRESSIVE ESCALATION."

   ON THE EVENING OF 5 OCTOBER, THE SALVADORAN PRELATE VISITED THE
BUILDING WHERE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ, CONSUL HUMBERTO
MURILLO, AND FIRST SECRETARY LUIS DE ANDA ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE TO
PERSONALLY ASSESS THE SITUATION INSIDE IN THE DIPLOMATIC HEADQUARTERS.

   AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ MET WITH THE ARCHBISHOP ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF
THE "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE COSTA RICAN
EMBASSY, BUT MILITARY MEN DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO REACH THE THIRD FLOOR
WHERE EMBASSY OFFICES ACTUALLY ARE.

   RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT "I NEED TO OBTAIN AN ARMY PERMIT TO
ENTER THE EMBASSY."

   POLICE DEPUTY DIRECTOR COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ SAID THAT THE
CONFLICT COULD END IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE RULED OUT MILITARY INTERVENTION TO EVICT THE
EMBASSY OCCUPANTS, BUT ARE USING "DISSUASIVE" ACTIONS TO PROMPT THEM
TO LEAVE.

   MEANWHILE, THE GROUP MAINTAINS THAT IT WILL NOT END ITS OCCUPATION
"UNTIL THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT MEDIATES TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT WILL END THE REPRESSION" AND THE ANTIRIOT POLICE LEAVE THE
AREA.

   NINE YOUNG WOMEN AND 11 YOUNG MEN ARE INVOLVED IN THE OCCUPATION.
SOME OF THEM ARE "CARRYING WEAPONS," CONSUL HUMBERTO MURILLO SAID.

   FECMAFAN CALLED FOR A MARCH THIS MORNING BEGINNING AT THE "LAS
AMERICAS" PLAZA, ABOUT 200 METERS FROM THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY, TO
DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS" AND END
THE EMBASSY OCCUPATION.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES TODAY BEEFED UP SECURITY IN SAN
SALVADOR BY POSTING ADDITIONAL TROOPS ON AVENUES AND AT BUILDINGS, AND
SEARCHING VEHICLES AS PART OF OPERATION "ATLACATL II," WHICH IS BEING
IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO PREVENT "TERRORIST" ACTIONS.
[PARIS AFP IN SPANISH AT 1617 GMT REPORTS THAT COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR
JESUS FERNANDEZ WAS PICKED UP BY AN AMBULANCE ON 5 OCTOBER TO BE
TREATED FOR A HEART AILMENT.  IT ADDS THAT ONE OF NINE REPORTERS STILL
INSIDE THE EMBASSY CALLED LOCAL STATIONS TO REPORT THAT THE POLICE DID
NOT ALLOW THEM TO RECEIVE FOOD PROVIDED BY THE GREEN CROSS]

BOMBINGS IN NORTHERN BOGOTA HAVE WOUNDED SIX PERSONS AND CAUSED
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.

   THE COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE REPORTED THAT THE FIRST
BOMB WAS PLACED AT A COLPATRIA BANK BRANCH ON 86TH STREET AND 15TH
AVENUE.  THIS BOMB CAUSED HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE BANK AND WOUNDED SIX
PASSERSBY.  THE WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE COUNTRY CLUB CLINIC, WHERE
THEY WERE TREATED AND RELEASED.

   THE SECOND BOMB WAS PLACED BY A YOUNG MAN AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

THE YOUNG MAN THEN ENTERED A NEARBY CARULLA SUPERMARKET, WHERE
CITIZENS CAPTURED HIM.

   BOGOTA, 6 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] FOUR MEN, WHO HAD 250 KG OF
DYNAMITE WITH THEM, WERE ARRESTED TODAY BY THE BOGOTA POLICE WHO SAID
THEY HAD DISMANTLED A BAND OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SOWING TERROR IN
THIS CITY.

   IN ORDER NOT TO HINDER THE INVESTIGATIONS, THE POLICE DID NOT
DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CAPTURED DURING THE
INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA.

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE FOUR MEN WERE ARRESTED,
FOLLOWING THE 5 OCTOBER ARREST OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING 15 KG OF
DYNAMITE IN A TAXI.

   SHORTLY BEFORE THAT, ANOTHER TERRORIST WAS NEARLY LYNCHED BY SOME
PEOPLE WHO CAPTURED HIM IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, AFTER HE PLACED AN
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A PRINTSHOP.

   A POLICE PATROL WENT TO THE SITE AND PREVENTED THE PRIVATE CITIZENS
AND BUSINESSMEN AFFECTED BY THE BOMBS FROM SERIOUSLY HARMING THE MAN
WHO WAS, NONETHELESS, SEVERELY BEATEN.

   THE BOGOTA POLICE SAID THAT THE ARREST OF THESE SIX TERRORISTS IN
THE LAST 24 HOURS AIDED IN UNCOVERING A PLAN TO DESTROY AN ELECTRICAL
GENERATING CENTER.

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED,
THANKS TO THE COOPERATION OF THE PEOPLE.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE QUICK
REACTION BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN LED TO THE ARREST OF ONE OF THE
TERRORISTS.

   THE SECOND TERRORIST WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE AFTER A TAXI DRIVER
REFUSED TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND REPORTED HIM AS A SUSPECT.

   WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS INTERROGATED, HE DISCLOSED INFORMATION THAT
ALLOWED THE POLICE TO LOCATE A HOUSE IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA WHERE FOUR MEN
WERE HIDING 250 KG OF DYNAMITE.

   THE TERRORISM AFFECTING SEVERAL COLOMBIAN CITIES IS THE RESPONSE
FROM DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO
DECLARED WAR ON THEM IN AUGUST.

   LIMA, 6 OCT 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [TEXT] GUILLERMO LARCO COX,
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND FOREIGN MINISTER, TODAY
REITERATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE KIDNAPPERS
OF TELEVISION MANAGER HECTOR DELGADO PARKER BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S
LEGITIMACY ITSELF WOULD BE AT STAKE.  LARCO COX ALSO SAID THAT THE
MEETING OF GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS WILL BE HELD AS PREVIOUSLY
SCHEDULED AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPLEMENTING EXTREME SECURITY
MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF VISITING DIGNITARIES AND
OFFICIALS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] HAS THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS
OF BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA BEEN MOVED FROM PARACAS?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS.  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
TWO MEETINGS IN PARACAS AND LAS DUNAS OVER 2 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WOULD
HAVE MEANT A DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS IN GUARANTEEING PROPER
COMMUNICATIONS.  THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE MOVED THE SITE OF THE
FIRST MEETING.

   I HAVE JUST HAD A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF THE COUNTRIES
MAKING UP THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  WE EXPLAINED TO THEM ALL THE SECURITY
MEASURES WE ARE IMPLEMENTING, NOT ONLY FOR THE PERSONAL SECURITY OF
DIGNITARIES BUT ALSO FOR THE SECURITY OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THE
MEETINGS WILL BE HELD.  PERU'S IMAGE IS AT STAKE.  WE HAVE TO BE VERY
CAREFUL TO PROTECT THIS IMAGE.

   [REPORTER] HAS THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO BEEN CANCELED?

   [LARCO COX] WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT WE LIVE IN A CITY WHERE
RUMORS THRIVE LIKE MUSHROOMS.  I WOULD NOT SAY THE COUNTRY IS LIKE
THAT, BUT IT IS TRUE THAT RUMORS IN THIS CITY USUALLY SPREAD OUT OF
CONTROL.  THE MEETING IN TRUJILLO WILL BE HELD.  I AM PERSONALLY PROUD
OF IT.

   [REPORTER] WHERE WILL THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU,
BOLIVIA, AND COLOMBIA BE HELD?

   [LARCO COX] IN ICA, IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE GROUP OF EIGHT WILL
MEET THE NEXT DAY.

   [REPORTER] WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN PANAMA?

   [LARCO COX] IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES ON OUR AGENDA.
LET US NOT FORGET THAT PANAMA IS ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS NOW MORE APPROPRIATELY CALLED THE
MECHANISM FOR POLITICAL CONSULTATION AND AGREEMENT, BUT IT WAS
ORIGINALLY MADE UP OF THE CONTADORA GROUP, OF WHICH PANAMA WAS A
MEMBER, AND THE CONTADORA SUPPORT GROUP, WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN LIMA
WHEN ALAN GARCIA TOOK OVER.

   [REPORTER] THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENTS IS OF GREAT CONCERN.  IS
EACH ONE ARRIVING WITH THEIR OWN SECURITY?  ARE THERE EXCEPTIONAL
MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED?

   [LARCO COX] THE DIGNITARIES MIGHT BRING THEIR OWN PERSONAL SECURITY
FORCES.  HOWEVER, OUR COUNTRY WILL GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE AREA,
THE BUILDINGS, AND THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY.

   [REPORTER] FOREIGN SOURCES HAVE BEEN SPECULATING THAT SOME
PRESIDENTS MIGHT NOT COME.  WHAT CAN YOU SAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF
THE HOST COUNTRY?

   [LARCO COX] THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS TO CALL THE AMBASSADORS OF
THESE COUNTRIES TO A MEETING BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
OBSERVE AND ASSESS OUR GUARANTEES.  THE RESULT OF THE MEETING WAS VERY
POSITIVE; THEY SUPPORTED US WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS.  THE AMBASSADORS HAVE
FOUND OUR EXPLANATION ON THE SECURITY MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED VERY
SATISFACTORY.  THESE MEASURES WENT INTO EFFECT TODAY.  SOME OF YOU
MIGHT HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THE OPERATIONS: WE ARE NOT ONLY STOPPING
TRAFFIC TO CHECK CARS, LUGGAGE, AND PEOPLE TRAVELING ON BUSES, BUT WE
HAVE ALSO KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON NEWCOMERS.  ALL FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE
ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ARE BEING WATCHED.
POLICE ARE CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE IN THE HOTELS WHERE THEY SAID
THEY WOULD BE.  THESE OPERATIONS ARE AIMED AT PREVENTING ANY EXTERNAL
AGGRESSION.  WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN RISKS, AND MANY MEN FROM THE
NATIONAL POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SECURITY
OPERATIONS THAT BEGAN AT NOON TODAY.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END

   LA RIOJA, 7 OCT 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] TODAY PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM
SAID THAT HE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "ALL THE POLITICAL COSTS THAT MAY
EMERGE" FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON TO MILITARY MEN AND CIVILIANS WHO
VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF
SEVERAL DECREES TODAY.

   MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON.  HE SAID: "I CANNOT
ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY
WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS.
WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE."

   MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO
RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED."

   MENEM SAID THAT IT IS "BASICALLY" IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US "TO BE
ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING."  REGARDING
THOSE PARDONED, MENEM SAID THAT HE WISHED THEM WELL AND THAT "THEY
SHOULD WORK IN PEACE HERE IN ARGENTINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE."

   HE INDICATED THAT HE IS WILLING "WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS TO MEET WITH
THEM" BECAUSE "IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED THEM IN THE NAME OF WHAT HE
REPRESENTS AND IF IN SOME WAY HE REPRESENTS THE LAW AND A LARGE SECTOR
OF THE COMMUNITY, THEN I AM WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS."
[SENTENCE AS RECEIVED]

   HE DENIED HAVING BEEN PRESSURED TO IMPLEMENT THE PARDON QUICKLY
"EITHER BY THE ARMED FORCES OR CIVILIANS."  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE
IS A MAN WHO DID NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON; HE IS
ADMIRAL ARMANDO LAMBRUSCHINI WHOSE 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED
BY A BOMB.  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
WHEM MEASURES OF THIS TYPE ARE IMPLEMENTED."

   MENEM CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "THIS MEASURE WHICH I TAKE UNDER MY
RESPONSIBILITY HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY AND OTHER
PARTIES IN ADDITION TO A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS."  


DEV-MUC3-0555 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES HAVE
PROPOSED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT A "DEMOBILIZATION PLAN" THAT
WOULD ENTAIL THE END OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, THE SURRENDER OF
WEAPONS, AND THE REPATRIATION OF CAPITAL IN EXCHANGE FOR A PARDON. THE
PLAN WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS AT THE LATEST, ACCORDING TO
INFORMATION PUBLISHED TODAY ON THE ALREADY FAMOUS GOVERNMENT-MAFIA
DIALOGUE BY LA PRENSA.

   THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER LA PRENSA, OF BOGOTA, YESTERDAY PUBLISHED
A REPORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY GERMAN
MONTOYA, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, HELD PEACE TALKS FOR A
YEAR WITH SPOKESMEN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE OFFICIAL HAS DENIED
THIS REPORT AND DESCRIBED IT AS "HARMFUL AND SLANDEROUS."

   ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE CARTEL BOSSES PRESENTED THE
PLAN TO THE PRESIDENCY IN SEPTEMBER 1988 AND THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD
HAVE WORKED ON IT "DIRECTLY AND SECRETLY."

   THE PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD THREE PHASES, WAS FORMULATED AFTER THE
MAFIA BOSSES HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE
PLAN (WHICH WAS PROPOSED TO THE COUNTRY ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1988) "WITHOUT
HESITATION."

   ACCORDING TO THE CARTEL PLAN, IN ADDITION TO GRANTING THE PARDON,
THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIFT THE STATE OF SIEGE REGULATIONS TO FIGHT
TERRORISM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES A
JUDICIAL PARDON FOR COLOMBIANS WANTED BY U.S. FEDERAL COURTS.  THIS
LAST ASPECT WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
"BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT FIND A WAY TO DISCUSS THE
MATTER WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS DECIDED TO FIGHT THE
PROBLEM MILITARILY," ACCORDING TO FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO, WHO
ACTED AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO VALLEJO, A TRIPARTITE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (COCAINE
CONSUMERS) ON THE NONEXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS WAS AN ESSENTIAL
REQUIREMENT FOR MONTOYA TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PACIFICATION CONTACTS.

   THE FORMER MINISTER SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED WAR ON
DRUG TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN THIS MEASURE
FIRST."  HE ADDED: "AFTER THE NUMEROUS MURDERS OF THE RECENT MONTHS,
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TALKING (WITH THE DRUG
BOSSES)."

   IN ACTIONS THAT OBSERVERS DESCRIBED AS "INEXPLICABLE," ASSASSINS
PAID BY THE COCAINE CARTELS KILLED FIVE COLOMBIAN PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, BETWEEN 27 JUNE AND
18 AUGUST.

   MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY
CONTINUED TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND ACCUSED OF HANDLING THE
ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE WITH A "DOUBLE STANDARD" AND CONCEALING "MANY
TRUTHS" RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ALVARO LEYVA, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SECURED THE DOCUMENTS THAT LA PRENSA PUBLISHED,
POINTED OUT: "I WANT THE FULL TRUTH TO BE DISCLOSED
 BECAUSE THE FATE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE IS AT STAKE."

   LEYVA FINALLY SAID: "I WANT TO KNOW ALL.  IT IS A SAD THING DEAD
MEN CANNOT SPEAK, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT
MEANT BUSINESS, AND WHO THOUGHT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AUTHORITIES DO
WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL."

   BOGOTA, 8 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19),
WHICH RECENTLY LAYED DOWN ITS WEAPONS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE AFTER
ACCEPTING THE PEACE PROCESS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO, BECAME A POLITICAL PARTY TODAY IN THE HOPE OF RULING
THE COUNTRY.

   AT THE END OF THE M-19'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD IN THE SOUTHWESTERN
CITY OF POPAYAN, CAUCA PROVINCE, THE MOVEMENT WAS FORMALLY CONSTITUTED
AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WITH ITS LEADER, CARLOS PIZARO LEONGOMEZ,
PROCLAIMED AS A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL.

   THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP, FOUNDED IN THE EARLY 1970'S AND
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ACTIVE, BECAME RENOWNED WHEN IT
OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA AND HELD SEVERAL AMBASSADORS
HOSTAGE AND WHEN IT LATER OCCUPIED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, WHERE
SEVERAL MAGISTRATES AND SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED.

   THE M-19 ANNOUNCED THE COMPOSITION OF ITS DIRECTORATE, WHICH IS
HEADED BY PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ AND INCLUDES SOME MEMBERS OF THE M-19'S
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, SUCH AS ANTONIO NAVARRO, GERMAN ROJAS, OTTI
PATINO, AND LIBARDO PARRA.

   IT ALSO INCLUDES MARCO CHALITA, WHO WILL RUN FOR THE SENATE FOR THE
SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF HUILA, AND VERA GREIFF, ROSEMBERG PABON, ANYAIR
ARTUNDUAGA, AND HEBER BUSTAMANTE.

   THE M-19 CONSIDERS IT A PRIORITY TASK TO CREATE A FOUNDATION BASED
IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT OF SANTA MARTA, WHICH WILL MANAGE FUNDS TO AID
THE RELATIVES OF SLAIN GUERRILLAS.

   THE FOUNDATION WILL BE NAMED AFTER JAIME BATEMAN, IDEOLOGIST AND
FOUNDER OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, WHO WAS KILLED IN AN AIRPLANE
ACCIDENT IN PANAMA.

THE GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS AND FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO WILL BEGIN
MEETING ON 9 OCTOBER IN TRUJILLO, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-LARGEST CITY,
570 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, SOME 15,000 OFFICERS, INCLUDING POLICE,
ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURITY
AT TRUJILLO AND ICA, 300 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.

   ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY,

SANGUINETTI, MEXICAN PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL MEET AT
THE "LAS DUNAS" HOTEL IN ICA 11-12 OCTOBER.  HOTEL WORKERS AND
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE.

   THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WILL ALSO BE MEETING
IN ICA ON 10 OCTOBER TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH
AFFECTS THEIR COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY.

   THIS MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR PARACAS, A TOWN NEAR ICA,
BUT WAS MOVED TO ICA FOR SECURITY REASONS.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY SINCE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO SOURCES, IT IS EXPECTED
THAT THE SHINING PATH AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MRTA) WILL TRY TO STAGE VIOLENT ACTS DURING THE MEETINGS.

   THE GUARDS AROUND THE EMBASSIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT COUNTRIES
HAVE BEEN REINFORCED WITH POLICE DOGS TRAINED TO DETECT EXPLOSIVES.

   POLICE HAVE ALSO ARRESTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LIMA TO CHECK ON
ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS OR TO SEE IF THEY HAVE
ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS.

   THE ROUNDUPS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT TO FIND LOCAL TELEVISION
MAGNATE HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, WHO WAS APPARENTLY KIDNAPPED BY THE
MRTA DURING AN INCIDENT IN WHICH DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND HIS
BODYGUARD WOUNDED.

   THE KIDNAPPING WAS CARRIED OUT BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TWO OF WHOM
WERE DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS, IN THE STREETS OF LIMA ON 4 OCTOBER.

   NEWSPAPER SOURCES TODAY SAID THAT AN ALLEGED LIEUTENANT TO MRTA
CHIEF VICTOR POLAY, WHO HAS BEEN IN PRISON SINCE DECEMBER 1988, HAS
ALSO BEEN ARRESTED.

   LIMA, 8 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A CONFIDENTIAL PERUVIAN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY LA
REPUBLICA, THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IS
PLANNING TO PROVOKE A FOOD SHORTAGE IN LIMA.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THIS ALLEGED SHINING PATH STRATEGY, BASED
ON THE THEORY BY THE LEADER OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION, MAO ZEDONG, "OF
LAYING SIEGE TO THE CITY FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE," IS PART OF THE
TERRORISTS' EFFORTS TO BOYCOTT THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS OF 12 NOVEMBER
1989 AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, THE GENERAL AND CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF
APRIL 1990.

   ACCORDING TO PASSAGES FROM THE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED IN LA REPUBLICA,
THE SHINING PATH "HAS REPORTEDLY GAINED CONTROL OVER AN IMPORTANT
SECTOR OF LIMA'S FOOD SUPPLY AND MARKETING NETWORK."

   OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT FARMER IN THE VALLEYS OF THE
PERUVIAN COAST AREA HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY "SHINING PATH PEOPLE" SO
THAT THEY NEITHER HARVEST NOR SELL THEIR PRODUCTS.  SIMILAR
INTIMIDATING ACTIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED IN THE SIERRA VALLEYS AND THE
PERUVIAN JUNGLE AREA, THE SAME SOURCES NOTED.

   PERUVIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ALSO EXPECT THE TERRORISTS
TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS BY BURNING THE TRUCKS
THAT SUPPLY LIMA WITH FOODSTUFFS.

   THIS SABOTAGE, THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT, "WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY
MASSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM AIMED AT
REDUCING THE REFRIGERATED STORAGE CAPACITY OF LIMA'S MAIN FOOD
SUPPLIERS."

   THE REPORTS POINTS OUT THAT THE BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS
WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A "SHINING PATH" CALL TO HOLD A "NATIONAL ARMED
STOPPAGE" FOR 12 NOVEMBER 1989, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A TRIAL FOR
SIMILAR ACTIONS IN THE APRIL 1990 GENERAL ELECTIONS.

   ELSEWHERE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED LAST NIGHT IN THE TOWN OF BARRANCA,

   TRUJILLO, 9 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY IN THE CITY OF TRUJILLO
THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND PERU BEGAN
DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUSTING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPTING ECUADOR IN ITS PLACE.  THE POSSIBILITY OF
EXPELLING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP WAS DISCUSSED EVEN THOUGH ARGENTINE
FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUSTING OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND REPLACING IT WITH ECUADOR, ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO
CAVALLO TOLD EFE: "WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT WE
PREFER NOT TO COMMENT FOR THE TIME BEING.  WE WILL SEE WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF THE MEETING WHAT THE BASIS FOR THAT PROPOSAL IS."

   CAVALLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS OR INITIATIVES ANY
DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED ON PANAMA."

   MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER FERNANDO SOLANA TOLD EFE THAT THE
PREPARATORY FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING WILL DISCUSS THE PANAMANIAN
ISSUE AND THAT MEXICO WILL DECIDE ITS STANCE "AT THE APPROPRIATE
TIME."

   BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ROBERTO DE ABREU SAID IN THIS CITY
YESTERDAY THAT BRAZIL HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION "BUT WILL ACCEPT AND
SUPPORT A JOINT AGREEMENT."

   PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX ALSO SAID YESTERDAY
THAT PERU WILL PROPOSE "THE FINAL SEPARATION OF PANAMA" FROM THE GROUP
OF EIGHT.

   LARCO ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE SEPARATION
OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP DURING THE SUMMIT MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD
WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY,
AND VENEZUELA ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER.  THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE IN
ICA, 850 KM SOUTH OF TRUJILLO.

   TODAY LARCO COX OPENED THE GROUP OF EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS'
MEETING IN TRUJILLO.  THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA
WERE ABSENT BECAUSE THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ICA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE
PRESIDENTS.

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH, LARCO COX CALLED ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES TO
STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITY, INTEGRATION, AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE REGION.

   COX ADDED: "WE MUST WORK FOR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT. WE PROPOSE AS AN
ACT OF JUSTICE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONTINENT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS CANNOT BE AN ISOLATED PROCESS
AND THAT UNITY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE COUNTRIES RESCUE THE
HISTORIC VALUES WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AMERICAS.

   THE MINISTERS ALSO DISCUSSED, IN ADDITION TO THE PANAMANIAN AND
ECUADORAN CASE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, JOINT ACTION TO DEAL
WITH THE REGION'S FOREIGN DEBT, ESTIMATED AT $420 BILLION, AND
TERRORISM.

   THE PROPOSALS MADE IN TRUJILLO WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE SEVEN
PRESIDENTS IN ICA.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IS BEING HELD UNDER POLICE AND
 MILITARY CONTROL TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. ON 4 OCTOBER A CAR
BOMB EXPLODED ABOUT 500 METERS FROM THE MEETING SITE.  FORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SOME OF THE SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED THE CHANGE OF THE FOREIGN
MINISTERS' ARRIVAL TIMES AND SOME CHANGES IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM.

   THERE IS STRICT POLICE CONTROL NEAR THE CESAR VALLEJO CIVIC CENTER
WHERE THE MINISTERS ARE MEETING.  VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WAS
PROHIBITED WITHIN ABOUT 200 METERS OF THE CENTER.

   THE FIRST MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT WAS HELD IN ACAPULCO,
MEXICO, IN 1987, AND THE SECOND MEETING WAS HELD IN PUNTA DEL ESTE,
URUGUAY, IN 1988.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 OCT 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COMMANDER GASPAR, RODRIGO ASTURIAS, MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, URNG, MILITARY DIRECTORATE BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] GREETINGS COMRADE. GUATEMALA ALWAYS COMES
UP IN CENTRAL AMERICAN NEWS.  WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT GUATEMALA.
INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES BLOCK REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA .  WE HAVE
LEARNED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF CHAOS AND INSTABILITY,
REPRESSION HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST 7 MONTHS.  IT WAS REPORTED
RECENTLY THAT 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, 2,500 WOUNDED -- MANY OF
THEM CRIPPLED -- AND HUNDREDS -- OVER 800 ARE MISSING. WE HAVE TAKEN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A VISIT PAID BY MR RODRIGO ASTURIAS, WHO IS MEMBER
OF THE URNG MILITARY DIRECTORATE AND IS ALSO KNOWN AS COMMANDER
GASPAR, NOT ONLY IN GUATEMALA AND CENTRAL AMERICA BUT THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD, TO TALK AND CLEAR SOME MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUATEMALA.

   COMMANDER GASPAR: SOME STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FIND A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION. THAT IS, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE GUERRILLA AND THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT.  SOME JOURNALISTS AND
SPECIALISTS WONDER IF THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS
COMPATIBLE WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA. WHAT COULD YOU
TELL US ABOUT THIS?

   [ASTURIAS] I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO
BE CLARIFIED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND MADE A
NEW PROPOSAL AIMED AT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL
ARMED CONFLICT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A
POLITICAL SOLUTION AND TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AS A FIRST STEP TO
CREATE THE CONDITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENTAILS AN
INCREASED EFFORT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT THINK OF
DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AS A DEMOBILIZATION ELEMENT BUT AS AN
EXTREMELY ACTIVE ELEMENT, AS A CLARIFYING ELEMENT, TO FIND AND PUT IN
PLACE CONSENSUS WITH DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH THERE
HAS BEEN, IN FACT, AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION -- WHICH BY THE WAY, IT
WAS BRUTALLY INTENSIFIED LAST MONTH -- THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A
POLITICAL SOLUTION AND THE CALL ALL NATIONAL SECTORS, WITHOUT
EXCEPTION, TO BEGIN CONTACTS, TALKS, AND DIALOGUE WITH THE UNRG
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO REFUSE THEM AND
CONTINUES MAINTAINING A CLOSED POSITION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN
THE DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER GASPAR, INSISTING IN THE LAST PART OF YOUR
RESPONSE, WHAT ARE THE BASIS IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF TALKS AND DIALOGUE
COULD BE INITIATED?

   [ASTURIAS] SINCE OCTOBER 1987, WHEN ITS FIRST DIALOGUE INITIATIVE
WAS ESTABLISHED, THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID PREESTABLISHED
CONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEMS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIALOGUE AND THE PREPARATION OF THE
AGENDA. THE MAIN PROBLEM THE COUNTRY HAS AND HAS HAD IN THE LAST FEW
YEARS IS THE LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MILITARIZATION
OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIETY, AND THE GENERALIZED OPPRESSION EXPERIENCED.
THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE
AGENDA IS THE DEMOCRATIZATION.

   [REPORTER] SPEAKING OF THE INTERNAL SITUATION FROM THE MILITARY
POINT OF VIEW, NEWS AGENCY REPORT EVERY DAY OF MISSING PERSONS,
KILLINGS, AND TORTURES. ARE THE ONES EVERYONE KNOWS AS THE DEATH
SQUADRONS INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITIES?

   [ASTURIAS] INDEED, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION. WE
COULD SAY WITHOUT BEING MISTAKEN THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST ESCALATION
HEADED BY STATE SECURITY FORCES. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DENOUNCE AND
TO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE THE ONES THAT ARE CARRYING OUT THIS
REPRESSION AND THE ONES THAT ARE TAKING FORWARD THIS TERROR CAMPAIGN
ARE NOT PARAMILITARY GROUPS AS THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE AND
THEY ARE NOT EXTREME-RIGHT CIVILIAN GROUPS. THEY ARE ARMY OPERATIVE
GROUPS THAT ACT BASED ON INFORMATION, CHARGES, SUSPICIONS, OR MANY
TIMES BLINDLY TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN FIND, IN WHAT WAY THEY
CAN HIT OR INFILTRATE THE PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.  WE ARE
FACED WITH AN ESCALATION OF THE STRONGEST STATE TERRORISM.  IT CANNOT
BE CONFUSED WITH DEATH SQUADRONS OR DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE RIGHT WING.
THE ARMY IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE OF THE REPRESSION. [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 OCT (AFP) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL ARMED CLASHES WITHIN
NATIONAL TERRITORY ON 8 OCTOBER RESULTED IN AT LEAST 8 KILLED AND MORE
THAN 20 INJURED, INCLUDING GUERILLAS AND SOLDIERS, A GOVERNMENT REPORT
SAID TODAY.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THAT AT LEAST FOUR
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND EIGHT WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE REBELS AMBUSHED A
MILITARY TRUCK NEAR SAN VICENTE, 60 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   IN ADDITION, TWO FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT REBELS
WERE KILLED IN HEAVY FIGHTING IN CIUDAD BARRIOS, SAN MIGUEL
DEPARTMENT, THE REPORT ADDED.

   TWO MORE REBELS WERE KILLED AND AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS
AND SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S EAST, THE
REPORT ALSO SAID.

   FINALLY, A STORE WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED IN SAN SALVADOR ON THE
NIGHT OF 8 OCTOBER WHEN A POWERFUL BOMB ALLEGEDLY PLANTED BY URBAN
GUERRILLAS EXPLODED.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   BOGOTA, 11 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] JOSE
RAFAEL ABELLO SILVA, CHIEF OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTEL ON THE COAST
AND FOURTH MAN IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS ARRESTED BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, IN NORTHERN BOGOTA DURING
THE LAST FEW HOURS.  ABELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S. FEDERAL COURT IN
OKLAHOMA, THE UNITED STATES, FOR CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE DRUGS.
ACTIVE IN THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND IS NOW
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE
COCAINE WHICH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL SENDS TO THE UNITED STATES.

   AVELLO, 34, NATIVE OF SANTA MARTA, HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN EARLY 1988
FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF WEAPONS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST.  SHORTLY
AFTER LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S ASSASSINATION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ASKED FOR
HIS EXTRADITION, BEARING IN MIND THAT THE FEDERAL COURT IN OKLAHOMA IS
TRYING HIM FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.  HIS EXTRADITION IS TAKEN FOR
GRANTYED, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT IT WILL TAKE PLACE ONCE ALL LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, WHICH WILL NOT BE BEFORE 1 WEEK.

   DAS SOURCES SAID THAT MONO AVELLO OFFERED 100 MILLION PESOS TO THE
SIX DETECTIVES WHO ARRESTED HIM LAST NIGHT AT AN EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT
IN BOGOTA'S NORTHERN SECTION.  THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN TRAILING HIM
IN BOGOTA FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THE ARMY HAS OCCUPIED SEVERAL OF HIS
PROPERTIES ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND HAS SEIZED VEHICLES AND YACHTS
BELONGING TO HIM.

   IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT PERUVIAN JUSTICE
YESTERDAY INSISTED AGAIN ON THE EXTRADITION OF EVARISTO PORRAS ARDILA,
WHO ESCAPED FROM A JAIL IN PERU WHILE SERVING A SENTENCE FOR DRUG
TRAFFICKING. [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 OCT 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL
SALVADORAN SECTORS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THE WIFE OF THE DEPUTY
EDITOR OF EL DIARIO DE HOY.  SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS NEAR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING.  SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS TERRORIST.  HE SAID THIS
IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WILL SURELY ALSO BE
CONDEMNED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PASTOR
RIBREJO, WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE LAST STRAW IS THAT TERRORISTS,
WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THEMSELVES, KILL DEFENSELESS WOMEN.  THIS
PARTICULAR LADY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS
WOUNDED.  WE THINK THIS IS THE LIMIT.  WE ARE NOT SURE WHO DID IT,
BUT, CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION, IT APPEARS TO BE A
TERRORIST CRIME.  WE ALREADY KNOW WHO PERPETRATES SUCH ACTIONS.  WE
THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HAS BEEN DOING.  THEY HAVE BEEN SILENCING VOICES
THAT UPHOLD PHILOSOPHIES THAT RUN CONTRARY TO THEIR'S.  [END
RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF PASTOR RIBREJO IN THE COUNTRY,
CRISTIANI SAID THE UN OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY
OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES DOES NOT FIT THE
VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE
FMLN THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT.  I THINK DR
RIBREJO WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE
ARMED FORCES ARE IN THE HABIT OF VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.  I THINK IF
ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL
ANARCHY. I THINK THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY.  THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH REASON
RATHER THAN VIOLENCE.  THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT
THE FMLN SAID IT WOULD DO.  IT SAID IT WOULD UNLEASH EVEN GREATER
VIOLENCE. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS
WITH THE FMLN, TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS. CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED
WORKING ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MEETING SO THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN
PEACE.

   SANTIAGO, 10 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [EXCERPT] LUIS CORVALAN LEPE, THE
LEADER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE [PCCH] WHO TODAY RETURNED TO
CHILE AFTER 13 YEARS OF EXILE IN THE USSR, HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT
FOR OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE "MANUEL RODRIGUEZ
NATIONAL LIBERATION PATRIOTIC FRONT [FRENTE PATRIOTICO MANUEL
RODRIGUEZ DE LIBERACION NACIONAL]" (FMLN), [AS RECEIVED] WHICH IS
IDENTIFIED AS THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE PCCH, CORVALAN SAID THAT "FOR
ETHICAL AND MORAL REASONS, I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE
STRUGGLED AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP."

   IN 1986, THE FMLN TRIED TO KILL GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET AND
ILLEGALLY INTRODUCED A LARGE ARMS CACHE INTO THE COUNTRY.  ITS LEADERS
ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A "PATRIOTIC WAR."  THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE AN ARMED STRUGGLE IF AYLWIN IS ELECTED.

   ADDRESSING JOURNALISTS AT THE SANTIAGO AIRPORT, CORVALAN SAID:
"VIOLENCE IS A SOCIAL FACTOR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SOCIETY HAS BEEN
UNABLE TO OVERCOME."

   ASKED WHETHER HIS JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE MAY HINDER AYLWIN'S
CANDIDACY, THE 73-YEAR OLD PCCH LEADER SAID HE DOES NOT BELEIVE THIS
WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE "AYLWIN'S CANDIDACY REPRESENTS THE EXPRESSION OF
ALL DEMOCRATIC TRENDS."

   CORVALAN ADDED: "AYLWIN IS A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE.  HE IS THE
CANDIDATE WHO SHOULD OBTAIN THE LARGEST SUPPORT UNDER THE CURRENT
CONDITIONS IN CHILE ON THE BASIS OF RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
POSITION OF EACH POLITICAL TREND."

   ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF PINOCHET AS THE CHILEAN ARMY COMMANDER
AFTER THE ASSUMPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, CORVALAN SAID: "IT
IS NOT PROPER FOR ONE PERSON TO GIVE ORDERS TO ANOTHER WHO WAS ELECTED
BY THE PEOPLE."

   CORVALAN SAID THAT THE OLD DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PCCH AND THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BECAUSE "ALL OF US
HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YARS."

   HE ADDED THAT THE PCCH MEMBERS "ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN
1973.  WE ARE IMMERSED IN PERESTROIKA, AND THERE HAVE BEEN
CONSIDERABLE CHANGES."  HE ADDED: "THE PDC HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED
CHANGES SINCE 1973."  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   BUENOS AIRES, 10 OCT 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINE FOREIGN
MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND HIS PERUVIAN COUNTERPART GUILLERMO LARCO
COX SIGNED THREE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS TODAY IN TRUJILLO, LIBERTAD
DEPARTMENT.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THE AGREEMENTS "CLEARLY SHOW THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TOWARD COMMON GOAL" WHICH MEANS "MOVING AHEAD TO
BUILD A GREAT LATIN AMERICAN NATION."

   THE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE PREPARED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF
THE TWO COUNTRIES, WERE SIGNED TODAY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS IN
THE OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVIAR DURING THE TIME HE LIVED
IN TRUJILLO.  THE CEREMONY WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES,
SEEKING TO PREVENT SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS.  SECURITY MEASURES WERE
REINFORCED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FOLLOWING AN ATTACK EARLY THIS
MORNING 12 BLOCS FROM THE HOTEL WHERE THE DELEGATIONS ARE STAYING.

   THE FIRST AGREEMENT CREATES THE POLITICAL COORDINATION AND
INTEGRATION COMMITTEE.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THIS IS AIMED AT "TAKING
MORE ORDERLY STEPS IN THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE AND PERUVIAN DESIRE FOR INTEGRATION HAS
ROOTS AS OLD AS THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE."

   THE SECOND AGREEMENT REFERS TO THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  CAVALLO SAID: "THIS
PROBLEM IS REACHING TERRIFYING DIMENSIONS BECAUSE ITS ECONOMIC POWER
IS MIXED WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE GROUPS.  AS SUCH IT IS BECOMING
A GROWING THREAT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES."

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH CAVALLO ALSO REFERRED TO THE THIRD AGREEMENT TO
PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AMONG AIR AND MARITIME ENTERPRISES.  HE SAID:
"INTEGRATION REQUIRES GOOD TRANSPORTATION METHODS WITH WHICH TO BRING
PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER" THUS MAKING "PROGRESS THROUGH CONCRETE
MECHANISMS IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IN WHICH OUR COUNTRIES ARE
INVOLVED."

   LARCO COX SAID THAT THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS "ARGENTINE PRESIDENT
CARLOS MENEM HAS CONFIRMED, THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HIS POLITICAL
WILL TO AGREE" TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REGION
BY SEEKING "NEW ROADS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ALREADY
RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS."

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS CEREMONY, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY UNDER
SECRETARY JOSE LUIS FERNANDEZ VALONI AND AMBASSADOR JULIAN LICASTRO,
TRUJILLO WAS SHAKEN AT 0400 BY FOUR POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOTIONS (A
FIFTH BOMB DID NOT EXPLODE) WHICH DESTROYED ABOUT HALF DOZEN OFFICES
OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE.

   THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH OPERATES WITH STATE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL, IS
LOCATED IN THE MONSERRATE DISTRICT WHERE THERE IS A HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE.  IT IS LOCATED 1 KM FROM THE PARADE
GROUND, DOWNTOWN TRUJILLO, ACROSS FROM WHICH IS LOCATED THE TURISTA
HOTEL.  THIS IS THE HOTEL WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA,
PERU, COLOMBIA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA ARE STAYING.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES AND THE POLICE HOLD THE
TUPAC AMARY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

COUNCIL SHOULD EXCLUDE WORLD SECURITY ISSUES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
[TELEVISION BROADCASTING INTERRUPTED FOR HALF A MINUTE DUE TO
TRANSMISSION PROBLESM]... WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL POWER. TO
THIS WE MUST ALSO ADD THE UNIFICATION OF THE EUROPE IN 1992. BESIDES,
THE SOVIET POLICIES OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY
MODIFIED NOT ONLY THE COMMUNIST IDEAS BUT ALSO THE FUTURE WORLD
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE.

   THESE TRANSFORMATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE INDUSTRIALIZED
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THEY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND
PROBABLY REDUCE EUROPEAN INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. BESIDES, THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE PERMANENTLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR
SOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION.

   WE STAND BEFORE A DIFFERENT WORLD WHICH IS OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES
WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, BUT WHICH ALSO CREATES DIFFICULTIES
FOR WHICH WE MUST BE PREPARED.  LATIN AMERICA SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS
SITUATION AND POLICIES IN FACE OF THE RAPID WORLD CHANGES. WE MUST
ANALYZE THE WAY IN WHICH WE WILL INTEGRATE AND HARMONIZE OUR ECONOMIES
IN THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SCENE.

   IN FACE OF THESE EVENTS, WE MUST REDEFINE OUR INTEGRATION FORMULAS
AND OUR DEVELOPMENT MODELS. I SUGGEST THAT A WORK GROUP BE FORMED TO
STUDY THIS SUBJECT AND TO ADOPT SPECIFIC MEASURES LEADING TO THE
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS OF LATIN AMERICA IN THIS NEW WORLD THAT
IS BEING BORN.

   MY DEAR PRESIDENTS AND FRIENDS, THIS NEW MEETING OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT MUST MAKE US STRENGTHEN OUR SOLIDARITY IN FACE OF THE THREATS
AGAINST DEMOCRACY AND OUR SOCIAL PROGRESS. WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE
REGIONAL COOPERATION MECHANISM AND OUR NEGOTIATED CAPACITY THROUGH THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY OF CONSENSUS TO MAKE OUR
PROPOSALS MORE SOLID.

   WE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT ARE UNITED BY UNDENIABLE
HISTORIC TIES OF FRIENDSHIP. WE ARE ALSO UNITED BY STRATEGIC,
POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WHICH MUST BE COORDINATED TO BE ABLE
TO SUCCESSFULLY FACE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW.

   AS I RECENTLY TOLD MY VENEZUELAN COUNTERPART, UNITY CAN BE SOLIDLY
BUILT ON FEASIBLE INITIATIVES RATHER THAN ON WORDS. INTEGRATION
THRIVES ON ACHIEVEMENT THAT IN PRACTICE BRING PEOPLES TOGETHER AND
ALLOW THEM TO ENJOY THE RESULTS OF PROGRESS OBTAINED THROUGH COMMON
EFFORT. YEARS OF STRUGGLE FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE SHOWN US THAT
DEVELOPMENT MUST BE BASED ON ACTIONS THAT WILL GENERATE CONFIDENCE AND
WELL-BEING, CONTRIBUTE TO NATURALLY COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS, AND SOLVE
SMALL AND LARGE PROBLEMS.

   COLOMBIA IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THE MECHANISM OF
CONSENSUS BY ENDORSING THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE MADE AND THOSE THAT WILL
SPRING FROM THIS SUMMIT MEETING.  THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]
 

DEV-MUC3-0570 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] APPROXIMATELY 1,600
SALVADORANS HAVE VOICED THEIR DETERMINATION TO RETURN TO EL SALVADOR
ON 17 OCTOBER, WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL, AFTER HAVING
REMAINED AS REFUGEES IN A HONDURAN CAMP SINCE THE EARLY 80'S.

   "WE INSIST ON RETURNING TO EL SALVADOR ON 17 OCTOBER.  HERE, WE ARE
BEING IMPRISONED FOR NO REASON.  WE ARE LEAVING BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE
WILL BE KILLED.  WE ARE SALVADORANS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO RETURN
TO OUR COUNTRY," SAID ONE OF THE REFUGEES IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

   INTERIOR MINISTER FRANCISCO MERINO WARNED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL
NOT ALLOW THE ENTRY OF REFUGEES WHO DO NOT HAVE IDENTIFICATION
DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES [UNHCR].

   "IF THEY ARRIVE ABRUPTLY AT THE SALVADORAN BORDER, WITHOUT THE
DOCUMENTS THAT CERTIFY THEY ARE SALVADORANS, THEY CANNONT ENTER THE
COUNTRY," MERINO POINTED OUT.

   ACCORDING TO MERINO, WHO IS ALSO THE SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT, THE
REFUGEES' DETERMINATION TO RETURN WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL IS
"EVIDENCE" OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.

   HOWEVER, THE REFUGEES -- INCLUDING WOMEN, THE ELDERLY, AND CHILDREN
-- DENIED ANY LINKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) GUERRILLAS.

   MERINO INTERPRETED THE REFUGEES' WISHES TO REPATRIATE IN A MASSIVE
AND IMMEDIATE MANNER AS "PLANS TO PROVOKE PROBLEMS THAT WILL AFFECT
THE IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTING
HUMAN RIGHTS."

   ON 10 OCTOBER, AN OFFICIAL COMMISSION, HEADED BY DEPUTY INTERIOR
MINISTER COLONEL CARLOS FIGUEROA VISITED THE HONDURAN CAMP AT MESA
GRANDE TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE REFUGEES SO THEY COULD
PREPARE FOR THEIR REPATRIATION IN 1990 AND AGREE ON THE PLACES WHERE
THEY WOULD BE RELOCATED.

   THE NATIONAL COMMISSION WAS UNABLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT FOR
POSTPONING THE REPATRIATION OF THE SALVADORANS TO 1990.

   THE MILITARY OFFICER DISCLOSED THAT THERE ARE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS
IN PREPARING FOR THE 17 OCTOBER REPATRIATION.

   "THE UNHCR IS NOT PREPARED TO GIVE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE
SALVADORANS WHO WANT TO RETURN NEXT WEEK AND IT NEEDS FOR BOTH PARTIES
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REFUGEES) TO REACH AN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO GO
AHEAD WITH THE REPATRIATION," COL FIGUEROA ADDED.

   ONE OF THE REFUGEES, WHO PREFERRED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, CHARGED
THAT UNHCR "HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GIVE US TRANSPORTATION AND THE HONDURAN
ARMY IS NOT ALLOWING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO REACH US.  IN ADDITION, WE
ARE THE TARGET OF HONDURAN MILITARY ATTACKS."

   IN MESA GRANDE, THERE ARE 3,718 SALVADORANS, OF WHICH 900 ARE
CHILDREN.  THESE REFUGEES LEFT EL SALVADOR EARLY IN 1980 WHEN THE WAR
WHICH HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 DEAD BROKE OUT.

   THERE ARE ALSO AN ADDITIONAL 13,000 SALVADORANS IN MESA GRANDE WHO
WANT TO BE REPATRIATED, SAYS THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD ON
REFUGEES, THAT CLAIMS TO REPRESENT THEM.

   THE REFUGEES ARE DEMANDING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT COMPLY WITH
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE SIGNED 2 YEARS AGO IN
GUATEMALA, WHICH -- ACCORDING TO THEM -- WOULD ALLOW THEM TO RETURN TO
THE COUNTRY WITH GUARANTEES.  


DEV-MUC3-0571 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 12 OCT 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS]
[PASSAGE OMITTED] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF
EIGHT REGARDING THE MALVINAS ISLANDS?  WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT SUPPORT
ARGENTINA IN THE DEFENSE OF ITS SOVEREIGNTY?

   [MENEM] THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS SUPPORTED ARGENTINA FOR A LONG TIME,
SO HAS OAS AND THE UN.  THEIR SUPPORT IS UNQUESTIONABLE.

   [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [MENEM] CUBA MAY JOIN THE OAS.  WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO IT.  AS
FOR PANAMA, IT CONTINUES TO BELONG TO THE OAS BUT NOT TO THE GROUP OF
EIGHT.  PANAMA HAS BEEN SUSPENDED TEMPORARILY FROM THIS GROUP UNTIL
DEMOCRACY RETURNS TO THAT COUNTRY.  THIS WILL BE STATED IN A DOCUMENT
WE ARE PREPARING DURING THIS MEETING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] IS THE PARDON FOR MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS IN
ARGENTINA DAMAGING THE MORAL HEALTH OF YOUR COUNTRY OR ARGENTINA
DEMOCRACY?

   [MENEM] NO, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PARDON HAS BEEN
GRANTED IN THE WORLD.  THERE HAVE BEEN PARDONS EVERYWHERE.  NOT LONG
AGO A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN URUGUAY AND IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY THE
URUGUAYAN PEOPLE.  A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN SPAIN AFTER THE [WORD
INDISTINCT].  THERE WERE PARDONS GRANTED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
PARDONS AND FORGETTING HAVE ALLOWED THE INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.  IT ALSO ALLOWED PRESIDENT BUSH TO PAY HOMMAGE TO
EMPEROR HIROITO, ONE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR,
DURING HIS FUNERAL.  THEREFORE WE CAN COMPLETELY OVERCOME THIS MATTER.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE OMITTED] REPORTED THAT ARGENTINA WOULD ASK TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMIT MEETING OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA, PERU,
AND BOLIVIA AND THE UNITED STATES.  IS THIS TRUE, AND WHAT WOULD BE
THE ARGENTINE ROLE IN THIS SUMMIT?

   [MENEM] NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT.  WE SUPPORT THIS SUMMIT MEETING,
AND CONTINUE MAINTAINING OUR SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST
DRUG TRAFFICKING.  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN COCA
PRODUCER AND COCA CONSUMER COUNTRIES.  THEY ARE BOTH PART OF A SAME
PROCESS, SO WE MUST CARRY OUT AN ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE THREE [AS
HEARD] PHASES OF DRUG PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISING.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] A STRONGER ACTION IS REQUIRED BY
[WORD INDISTINCT] ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

   [MENEM] I THINK THAT WE NEED THE WILL OF EVERY ONE.  WE WOULD NOT
GAIN ANYTHING BY RESTRICTING THE PRODUCTION OF COCA IN PERU, COLOMBIA,
AND BOLIVIA IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HELP TO SUBSTITUTE THIS
CROP.  WE CANNOT DIVIDE THIS ACTION.  THE FIGHT MUST BE AN ALL OUT WAR
BY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, BECAUSE DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT
IN ALL COUNTRIES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT CAN CLAIM THAT
THERE IS NO DRUG ADDICITON OR TRAFFICKING IN ITS TERRITORY.  NOT LONG
AGO, I READ THAT 14 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE HANGED IN SAUDI ARABIA,
WHERE THEY ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND WHERE THERE IS STRICT CONTROL
OVER ANY KIND OF VICE.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] WHAT POSITION HAS ARGENTINA
MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE?
DO YOU THINK ALL THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBERS WILL ARRIVE TO A JOINT
POSITION REGARDING THIS ISSUE?

   [MENEM] WE ARE CURRENTLY RENEGOTIATING OUR DEBTS INDIVIDUALLY
BECAUSE EACH COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT. THE ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE SO FAR
NOT BEEN INTEGRATED BUT THEY MUST BE INTEGRATED. AS LONG AS WE DO NOT
ATTAIN INTEGRATION, THE FOREIGN DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT
INDIVIDUALLY.  IF WE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION, THINGS MAY
CHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. FOR THE TIME BEING THE NEGOTIATIONS
WILL BE CARRIED OUT SEPARATELY.

   [REPORTER] PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY CALLED FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF CONCRETE INTEGRATION GOALS FOR 1992.  HAS THIS BEEN
DISCUSSED BY THE PRESIDENTS? WILL CONCRETE GOALS BE FIXED?

   [MENEM] WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS. WE HAVE ALREADY SET CONCRETE GOALS,
BASED ON EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH
BRAZIL, WHICH URUGUAY RECENTLY JOINED. THIS MUST SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE
FOR THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. OF COURSE WE MUST NOT
FORGET SOME OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE ANDEAN
PACT WHICH IS REVIVING AND REORGANIZING ITSELF, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS
NOT ONLY IN LATIN AMERICA BUT IN THE WHOLE AMERICAN CONTINENT. WE ARE
HEADING TOWARD A CONTINENTAL UNITY LIKE THAT OF CANADA AND THE UNITED
STATES. AFTER LATIN AMERICA ACHIEVES INTEGRATION WE WANT INTEGRATION
WITH CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AMERICA. [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [MENEM] PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WAS SURPRISED, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT THE CREW OF THE THREE PLANES WE DONATED TO COLOMBIA HAD ALREADY
RETURNED TO ARGENTINA. HOWEVER, THEY ARE STILL THERE WAITING FOR THE
AIRPLANES TO BE PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0572 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LIMA, 12 OCT 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] THERE ARE SERIOUS DISCREPANCIES AMONG THE PREESIDENTS
ATTENDING TO THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE.  IS IT
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS PREVAILING IN EACH COUNTRY?

   [GARCIA] WE HAVE A COMMON STANCE.  NO COUNTRY CAN PAY WHAT IT IS
BEING ASKED TO PAY.  WE ALL KNOW THIS.  PEOPLE KNOW IT.  THE LABOR
UNIONS KNOW IT.  THEREFORE, THAT IS OUR STANCE.

   A FEW YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES MADE AN EFFORT TO PAY.  NOWADAY,
EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY CANNOT PAY AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THE
PAYMENT CONDITIONS.  THIS IS THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE ALL SHARE.

   THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES RESORT TO THE BRADY PLAN, THAT OTHERS
SEEK OTHER ALTERNATIVES, OR THAT OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO PAY A DEBT THAT
THEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR -- AT LEAT UNTIL CONDITIONS CHANGE OR
PAYMENTS ARE REDUCED -- ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF A COMMON
STANCE.  THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY VERIFYING THAT
NO COUNTRY IS ABLE TO PAY THE DEBT IN CONTRACTED, A DEBT THAT HAS
GROWN ONLY BECAUSE OF INTERESTS.

   I WILL REITERATE SOME DRAMATIC BUT REALISTIC FIGURES: 10 YEARS AGO
LATIN AMERICA OWED $190 BILLION.  IT PAID $289 BILLION TO DECEMBER
1988 -- THAT IS 10 YEARS -- AND IT STILL OWES $430 BILLION.  IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS REDUCED ITS PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION
DRAMATICALLY BY 2 TO 3 PERCENT A YEAR.  IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN
AMERICA REDUCED ITS IMPORTS, SEEKING TO SPEND LESS DOLLARS.  IT
INCREASED ITS EXPORTS AND DEVALUED ITS CURRENCIES TO OBTAIN DOLLARS
WITH WHICH TO PAY THE DEBT.

   IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA GREW ONLY 1 PERCENT PER YEAR,
AND IT HAS USED THAT 1 PERCENT, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 4-PERCENT OF ITS
GNP, TO PAY THE DEBT.

   THEREFORE, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 10 YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT WE
OWE MORE, PRODUCE LESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY OUR DEBT.  WE ALL
KNOW THIS.  IT HAS COST US 10 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER IT IS
AN EXPERIENCE THAT CONSTITUTES THE BASE FOR OUR COMMON STANCE.

   [REPORTER] HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD SINCE THE PUNTA DEL
ESTE SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A BRADY PLAN IF WE HAD NOT MET IN
ACAPULCO OR IN PUNTA DEL ESTE?  ONE OF JAMES BRADY'S ADVISERS
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES STATING THAT THE BRADY PLAN
WAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 1985 TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE
PERUVIAN ATTITUDE OF UNILATERALLY REDUCING ITS DEBT PAYMENTS.

   WHO KNOWS IF THE ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETINGS HAVE NOT LED
THE CREDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEBT IS NOT WORTH ITS FACE VALUE
AND THAT IT MUST BE REDUCED?

   THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  WHO KNOWS IF NEXT YEAR WE WILL
BE SPEAKING OF REDUCING THE DEBT BY 50 PERCENT AND NOT JUST THE 20
PERCENT THAT WE NOW SEEK?

   YOU SEE, THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE UNABLE TO PAY AND THAT WE
ARE NEGOTIATING TO PAY LESS, BUT THE CREDITORS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY IF THEY INSIST ON THEIR
CLAIMS.

   THEREFORE, IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE HEADING TO
WARD DISARMAMENT, WHY CAN'T THERE BE A FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT BETWEEN
THE RICH AND POOR?  I THINK THAT ECONOMIC TRENDS WILL FOLLOW THIS
LINE.

   [REPORTER] PRESIDENT, WHY HASN'T PANAMA BEEN DEFINITIVELY EXPELLED
FROM THIS GROUP, AND WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?

   [GARCIA] PANAMA AS A COUNTRY, INDEPENDENT OF ITS PAST
ADMINISTRATIONS, WAS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  NO
COUNTRY CAN BE EXPELLED.  THIS IS A TERM THAT WOULD OFFEND THE
CITIZENRY OF A COUNTRY.  WE SIMPLY RATIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PANAMA
INDEFINITELY UNTIL PANAMA IS GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
GOVERNMENT.  THAT WAS OUR DECISION.

   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] THE OAS?

   [GARCIA] WE ARE PREPARING A PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE STATE THAT THE OAS
IS AN IMPORTANT FORUM OR MECHANISM FOR HEMISPHERIC DIALOGUE BUT WHICH
MUST INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE YET
NOT MEMBERS.

   [REPORTER] WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?

   [GARCIA] I HOPE SO.  THIS IS THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I WILL ATTEND A
MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH I HELPED TO CREATE.  HOWEVER, I
HOPE THIS GROUP WILL LEAD ANNUAL AND PERIODICAL MEETINGS OF ALL LATIN
AMERICA PRESIDENTS.  I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS HOPE SINCE 1985.  I HOPE
THAT LATIN AMERICA WILL ANNUALLY COORDINATE SOME KIND OF COLLEGIAL
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS
THE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND I AM SURE THAT IT WILL EXPAND IN THE
FUTURE.

   HOWEVER, AT A CONTINENTAL LEVEL, THE ISSUES CANNOT RUN AS FAST AS
FOR A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE, OR A POLITICAL PROCESS.  A CONTINENT REQUIRES
MUCH LONGER TERMS AND WE MUST BE PATIENT.  LET US GO TO ANOTHER
SUBJECT NOW.

   [REPORTER] HUMAN RIGHTS.  TWO OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICAN
LIFE ARE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  PRESIDENT MENEM HAS
RECENTLY PARDONED MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS WHO WERE SERVING
PRISON SENTENCES.  THERE IS ALSO A CONFLICTIVE SITUATION IN PERU
REGARDING SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING TRIED FOR MURDERS
COMMITTED IN JAILS.  ARE YOU WILLING TO PARDON THOSE MILITARY OFFICERS
TO PACIFY THE SITUATION?  THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION.

   SECOND, THE PERUVIAN IMAGE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IS VERY
BAD BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION.  IN CONTRAST WITH ACAPULCO AND
PUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ARE HOLIDAY RESORTS WITH MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
INFRASTRUCTURES, THE CITY OF ICA REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF LATIN
AMERICAN CITIES.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION DOING TO
THRUTHFULLY REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY?  TION DOING TO THRUTHFULLY
REPORT ON PERUVIAN REALITY?  [CONTINUED]

   CUCUTA, 13 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE FAMILY OF NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ
RODRIGUEZ, THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ, SAID TODAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KIDNAPPED 72-YEAR-OLD RODRIGUEZ
RODRIGUEZ ARE ASKING FOR $10 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 4.1 BILLION PESOS,
FOR HIS RELEASE.  INES RODRIGUEZ COLMENARES, DAUGHTER OF THE KIDNAPPED
MAN, TODAY READ A STATEMENT ON THE PRIVATELY OWNED RCN [RADIO CADENA
NACIONAL], THE MAIN RADIO STATION ALONG THE COLOMBIAN - VENEZUELAN
BORDER, IN WHICH THE FAMILY STATES THAT THE SUM REQUESTED IS
"UNIMAGINABLE."

   RODRIGUEZ, FORMER VENEZUELAN CONSUL IN CUCUTA, WAS KIDNAPPED ON 14
JULY BY FOUR PERSONS WHO HAD REMAINED SILENT UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO.

   IN THEIR STATEMENT, THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY SAID THAT THE $10 MILLION
RANSOM IS NOT WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ADDED THAT "THE KIDNAPPERS MUST
KNOW WHAT OUR REAL ECONOMIC CAPACITY IS."

   "WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE OUR FATHER'S RELEASE, BUT WITHIN OUR
MEANS," THE DOCUMENT ADDS.

   THE KIDNAPPERS, BELIEVED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-CASTRO ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN), REPORTEDLY ADVISED THE RODRIGUEZ FAMILY
YESTERDAY OF THEIR DECISION TO NEGOTIATE HIS RELEASE.

   NORBERTO RODRIGUEZ IS THE BROTHER OF BLANCA DE PEREZ, WIFE OF
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.


DEV-MUC3-0574 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   QUITO, 12 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THIS YEAR, FRANCE WILL GRANT
ECUADOR A 310 MILLION-FRANC LOAN AND A NON-REPAYABLE LOAN FOR 20
MILLION.  FRANCE WILL ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND WILL
SUPPORT ECUADOR'S STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ITS EFFORTS TO
SOLVE ECUADOR'S FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, PRESIDENTS FRANCOIS MITTERRAND
AND RODRIGO BORJA ANNOUNCED TODAY IN QUITO.

   THUS, THE FRENCH AID TO ECUADOR IN 1989 WILL TOTAL 400 MILLION
FRANCS, SINCE FRANCE PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO GRANT LOANS FOR 180 MILLION
FRANCS TO ECUADOR.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON 12 OCTOBER, SHORTLY BEFORE MITTERRAND
CONCLUDED HIS OFFICIAL 2-DAY VISIT TO ECUADOR, WHERE HE HELD A PRIVATE
MEETING WITH BORJA -- A FELLOW MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL --
AFTER ECUADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ AND EDWIGE AVICE,
DELEGATE FROM THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SIGNED AN LETTER
OF INTENTION.

   FROM THE TOTAL LOANS, 165 MILLION FRANCS WILL BE USED FOR THE FIRST
PHASE OF A PROJECT TO REHABILITATE THE CENTRAL RAILROAD.  THE PROJECT
INCLUDES THE REHABILITATION OF 900 KM OF THE RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN THE
ECUADORAN MOUNTAIN RANGE AND THE ECUADORAN COAST, BORJA SAID.  HE
REVEALED THAT THE LOAN IS TO BE PAID BACK IN 25 YEARS, WITH A 5-YEAR
GRACE PERIOD AND LOW INTEREST RATES.  HE ALSO NOTED THE SOCIAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT, IN A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULT AND RUGGED
TERRAIN.  THE REMAINING FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY POTABLE WATER TO
THE PROVINCES OF IMBABURA IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE, AND MANABI IN THE
COASTAL REGION.

   WITH REGARD TO ECUADOR'S FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH EXCEEDS $11 BILLION,
MITTERRAND SAID HE IS "WILLING TO PERSONALLY ASSIST," IN THE STUDY OF
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN, AND TO INTERCEDE
BEFORE THE PARIS CLUB, TO WHICH ECUADOR OWES $400 MILLION.

   MITTERRAND ASKED BORJA TO GIVE HIM TIME TO STUDY THE BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS ON THE DEBT.  IN THIS REGARD, MITTERRAND CLEARLY EXPRESSED
THAT THE DEBT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN.  HE BELIEVES THIS IS AN OVERALL
PROBLEM AND IS "MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE ATOMIC BOMB," BECAUSE THE
COUNTRIES FACING THIS PROBLEM CANNOT CONTROL IT."  AT THE SAME TIME,
MITERRAND ASKED: "WHO CAN CONTROL THE MISERY AND THE DISTURBANCES"
THIS PROBLEM WILL GENERATE?

   MITTERRAND ADDED THAT EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO IMPROVE THE WEAK
BILATERAL TRADE, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALLED 321.3 MILLION FRANCS ($50.6
MILLION), WITH A DEFICIT OF 56.5 MILLION FRANCS FOR ECUADOR ($8.9
MILLION).

   MITTERRAND SAID FRENCH EXPERTS WILL STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF
BOOSTING SALES OF ECUADORAN PRODUCTS TO FRANCE, ESPECIALLY SEAFOOD
PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SHRIMP, AS WELL AS BANANAS, WHICH FRANCE CURRENTLY
BUYS FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  "WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS OPEN NEW DOORS,"
MITTERRAND ADDED.  HOWEVER, HE INSISTED ON THE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE
STUDIES THE EXPERTS WILL CARRY OUT.

   THE CHIEFS OF STATE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A COOPERATION
AGREEMENT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, STILL AT AN EARLY
STAGE IN ECUADOR.  THROUGH THIS AGREEMENT, SIGNED BY ECUADORAN
GOVERNMENT MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO AND FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER PIERRE
JOXE, A PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS SCOURGE.  FRANCE
WILL PROVIDE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO THE ECUADORAN
POLICE.

   MITTERRAND SAID HE THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH BORJA,
ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT A SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF ECUADOR, WHICH IS NOT A
PRODUCING COUNTRY, BUT IS USED FOR THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS.  HE
MADE AN APPEAL TO ORGANIZE A WORLD FRONT TO ELIMINATE THIS SCOURGE.

   BORJA CONFIRMED MITTERRAND'S STATEMENTS AND ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH
ECUADOR "IS NOT A DRUG-PRODUCING COUNTRY, WE WILL NOT REST," BECAUSE I
BELIEVE OTHER COUNTRIES "BEGAN LATE" IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS
EVIL.

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS AGREED ON THE NEED TO CONCERTED EFFORTS -- AMONG
COUNTRIES PRODUCING AND CONSUMING DRUGS, COUNTRIES USED FOR THE
TRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS, AND FOR MONEY LAUNDERING -- TO FACE THIS
SCOURGE.  THE TWO PRESIDENTS COMMITTED THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS RESPECT.

   MITTERRAND, WHO UPON CONCLUDING HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR WILL MAKE A
STOPOVER IN BOGOTA, SAID THAT HIS UNSCHEDULED VISIT TO COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IS "TO GIVE OPEN TESTIMONY ON THE SOLIDARITY
THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT OF SUCH A COURAGEOUS GOVERNMENT.

   FINALLY, MITTERRAND NOTED THE BENEFITS OF HIS VISIT TO ECUADOR --
WHICH HE EXPECTS TO REPEAT -- AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOMING HE
RECEIVED.  BORJA THANKED THIS "GREAT EUROPEAN AND WORLD LEADER, WHO IS
OFFERING HIS FRIENDSHIP TO US," FOR HIS VISIT.  


DEV-MUC3-0575 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 14 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE WAVE OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS TO
WHICH COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUBJECTED CONTINUED
LAST NIGHT WHEN WILLIAM BENDECK OLIVELLA, DIRECTOR OF A RADIO NEWSCAST
IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF MONTERIA, WAS KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED IN BOGOTA, THE NEWSMAN, 57, WAS ABOUT
TO ENTER HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS GUNNED DOWN BY SEVERAL ARMED MEN.

   BENDECK OLIVELLA HAD BEEN PRESS ASSISTANT TO NICARAGUAN DICTATOR
ANASTASIO SOMOZA, BUT WENT TO COLOMBIA AFTER THE TRIUMPH OF THE
SANDINIST REVOLUTION.

   BENDECK OLIVELLA IS THE SECOND NEWSMAN TO BE MURDERED THIS WEEK.
ON TUESDAY, SEVERAL GUNMEN KILLED ROBERTO SARASTY BOTERO, WHO WORKED
FOR THE CARACOL RADIO NETWORK IN MEDELLIN.

   ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT YET HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION, THE
POSSIBILITY THAT BENDECK OLIVELLA MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR POLITICAL
REASONS HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT SINCE HE WAS A POLITICAL SPECIALIST.

   FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, NEWSMEN IN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN FACING A
SERIOUS THREAT FROM THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WHICH EVEN PARTIALLY
DESTROYED THE MAIN OFFICES OF THE BOGOTA MORNING PAPER EL ESPECTADOR,
IN REPRISAL FOR THE PAPER'S HARSH ATTACKS ON THE COCAINE TRAFFICKING
ORGANIZATIONS.


DEV-MUC3-0576 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 12 OCT 89 (RADIO MAGALLANES) -- [COMMENTARY]
[CHILEAN JOURNALIST ROLANDO CARRASCO] [TEXT] WE HAD BEEN LEFT
COMPLETELY ALONE AND ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT
HAD BEEN OVERTHROWN, THE DICTATORSHIP HAD SCATTERED CONCENTRATION
CAMPS AND ANONYMOUS DEAD AROUND THE COUNTRY, CONGRESS WAS CLOSED, ALL
LEFTIST COMMUNICATION MEDIA WERE ALSO CLOSED, AND THE IMAGE OF THE
DICTATORSHIP MONOPOLIZED THE TELEVISION SCREENS.  PINOCHET NEEDED TO
BE LEFT ALONE IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER BY MURDERING HIS
OPPONENTS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE SENT MISSIONS ABROAD TO SEEK
RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT.

   IN THE FIRST DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COUP, RADIO MOSCOW BEGAN TO
BEAM PROGRAMS TO CHILE, AND I AM NOW TALKING TO YOU FROM ITS STUDIOS.
VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST
PARTY, WAS BY CHANCE IN MOSCOW IN SEPTEMBER 1973, AND IT FELL TO HIM
TO INITIATE THE PROGRAMS "LISTEN, CHILE" [ESCUCHA, CHILE] AND RADIO
MAGALLANES OVER THE MICROPHONES OF RADIO MOSCOW.  THE AUDIENCE OF
THESE PROGRAMS SUDDENLY GREW INSIDE CHILE.

   AT FIRST, THE PROGRAMS DENOUNCED THE ARBITRARY ACTION OF THE
MILITARY REGIME.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SMUGGLE NEWS OUT OF CHILE SO
THAT IT COULD BE BROADCAST ALL OVER CHILE BY RADIO MOSCOW, BUT NEWS OF
THE WORLD'S SOLIDARITY WAS BROADCAST NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO CHILE.
THUS, THE WALL OF SILENCE THE DICTATOR INTENDED TO RAISE AROUND HIM TO
HIDE HIS CRIMES WAS CRACKED.

   A TRADITION OF LISTENING RADIO MOSCOW PROGRAMS TO LATIN AMERICA WAS
DEVELOPED IN CHILE AS ATTESTED BY THE MAIL THAT REACHED ITS STUDIOS.
THE BULK OF MAIL FROM CHILE CONFIRMS THIS.  SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
THE MOSCOW TRANSMISSIONS WERE HELPING THE CAUSE OF THE PERSECUTED, THE
WORKERS, THE STUDENTS, THE PRISONERS, THE MUZZLED DEMOCRATS, AND THE
GRIEVING WIDOWS OF CHILE.  THROUGH THESE TRANSMISSIONS, THOSE PEOPLE
RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AN ENCOURAGEMENT SENT BY THE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD.

   THE FIRST BROADCASTS WERE MADE IN THOSE YEARS, AND VERY FEW HAVE
NOT LISTENED TO THEM AT SOME TIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY ADMITTED TO
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS.  THE TYRANT HIMSELF VIOLENTLY ATTACKED
THE PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC SPEECHES.  NOT LONG AGO, PINOCHET'S
FOREIGN MINISTER AGAIN SCATHINGLY REFERRED TO RADIO MOSCOW'S
BROADCASTS.  THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO
AFFECT THE DICTATORSHIP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT THEY HAVE
HELPED THE RESURGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  THE RESURGENCE AND
ORGANIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES THROUGH THE IMPETUS OF THE
WORKERS AND BROAD SECTORS OF THE POPULATION HAVE RESHAPED THE CHILEAN
POLITICAL SITUATION, TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE REAL
POSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTORAL TRIUMPH BY A SINGLE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE
TO THE PRESIDENCY, THUS SETTING THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION IN MOTION.

   IN FACT THE SITUATION NOT ONLY HAS CHANGED IN CHILE, BUT ALSO IN
THE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE PERESTROYKA -- A REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS
INSIDE A REVOLUTION -- HAS OPENED IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET SOCIETY.  WE
FREQUENTLY KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS OF
RADIO MOSCOW.  SO, ALL THIS HAS GALVANIZED OUR DISPOSITION TO CONTINUE
COOPERATING IN THIS PROCES THAT HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS.

   OUR PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE OPEN AND AT THE DISPOSAL OF ALL ADVANCE
FORCES THAT MARCH WITH THE DEMOCRATS.  A FEW WEEKS AGO, RADIO MOSCOW
COMPLETED 16 YEARS OF BROADCAST TO CHILE.  NOW, ON 29 OCTOBER RADIO
MOSCOW WILL CELEBRATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY.  ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE
WORLD KNOW THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW IN 81 LANGUAGES.  THE PROGRAMS
TO CHILE HAVE A PRIVILEGED PLACE AMONG THEM.  FOR THE OCCASION,
GREETINGS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW AND RADIO
MAGALLANES.  FROM CHILEANS SCATTERED IN 40 COUNTRIES BY THE FASCIST
EXPLOSION, RADIO MOSCOW ALSO RECEIVES MAIL AND POSTCARD WITH MESSAGES
OF APPRECIATION AND THANKS.  THIS IS A MODEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THE
VALUABLE ASSISTANCE RADIO MOSCOW HAS GIVEN, IS GIVING, AND WILL

   WE HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, AND RADIO MOSCOW
PROVED TO BE OUR FRIEND DURING SHAMEFUL TIMES.  GOOD NIGHT.

   LIMA, 15 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] VICTOR POLAY, THE LEADER OF THE
PERUVIAN TERRORIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA) GROUP,
TODAY ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MRTA WILL PROPOSE HIS RELEASE
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF TELEVISION IMPRESARIO HECTOR DELGADO
PARKER.  POLAY IS BEING HELD AT A PENITENTIARY IN LIMA.

   THE REMARKS BY POLAY, WHO WAS CAPTURED BY PERUVIAN POLICE IN
FEBRUARY 1989 IN THE CITY OF HUANCAYO, 315 KM EAST OF LIMA, WERE
PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIMA DAILY "LA REPUBLICA," WHICH INTERVIEWED
HIM AT HIS CELL IN LIMA'S CANTO GRANDE PENITENTIARY.

   LAST THURDAY [12 OCTOBER], THE WEEKLY "CAMBIO," WHICH IS DESCRIBED
BY POLICE SOURCES AS THE MRTA'S UNOFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, REPORTED THAT
THE MRTA -- WHICH UPHOLDS THE BELIEFS OF GUERRILLA ERNESTO "CHE"
GUEVARA -- KIDNAPPED IMPRESARIO DELGADO PARKER ON 4 OCTOBER 1989 IN
LIMA, SAYING THAT HE WILL BE TRIED "BY A REVOLUTIONARY COURT."

   DELGADO PARKER WAS AN ADVISER TO PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND
IS THE GODFATHER OF ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS.

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF THE IMPORTANT
PERUVIAN TELEVISION IMPRESARIO IS OF A"POLITICAL" NATURE AND IS
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER KIDNAPPINGS OF OTHER PROMINENT TYCOONS CARRIED
OUT BY THE MRTA PEOPLE TO OBTAIN RANSOM MONEY, AND THAT, THEREFORE,
THE PETITION THAT WILL BE MADE "MUST BE POLITICAL."

   POLAY TOLD "LA REPUBLICA" THAT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELGADO
PARKER'S KIDNAPPING, A BLOODY ACTION IN WHICH THE IMPRESARIO'S DRIVER
WAS KILLED AND THE IMPRESARIO'S BODYGUARD WAS INJURED.  POLAY SAID
THAT HE CANNOT PREDICT THE DECISION THAT THE "REVOLUTIONARY COURT"
WILL MAKE AFTER THE "PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT" TO WHICH THE IMPRESARIO WILL
BE SUBJECTED.

   POLAY, HOWEVER, ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXCHANGE DEAL
BECAUSE "THE KIDNAPPING IS POLITICAL AND THE PETITION THAT WILL BE
MADE MUST BE POLITICAL."

   THE PUBLICATION OF POLAY'S INTERVIEW TODAY COINCIDES WITH REPORTS
BY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON THE CAPTURE OF 12 REGIONAL MRTA LEADERS.  THIS
NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA, 870 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATIONS, LEADING TO
THE CAPTURE OF THE MRTA LEADERS, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER THE PAST
FEW DAYS, AND THAT ACTIVISTS, WHO WERE OPERTING IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
CAJAMARCA, LA LIBERTAD, AND ANCASH IN NORTHERN PERU AND WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20 BOMB ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, HAVE
BEEN DETAINED.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE ADDED THAT FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND PROPAGANDA
MATERIAL WERE SEIZED FROM THE MRTA LEADERS.

[PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ] [TEXT] IT IS A PLEASURE FOR ME TO MEET
WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO FOR THE SECOND TIME, IN MY ROLE AS
PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA, TO TO CONTINUE REVIEWING -- 6 MONTHS LATER --
ISSUES WHICH ARE OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO OUR TWO NATIONS.  I ALSO WISH
TO PROVE WITH THIS ACTION THAT WE ARE WILLING TO CARRY OUT OUR PLANS
FOR COOPERATION AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  ON THIS OCCASION WE ARE
PROVING THAT WE WANT TO PERMANENTLY FOLLOW UP THE GOALS ESTABLISHED
DURING OUR FIRST MEETING.

   HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BARCO, ON THIS OCCASION I WISH TO STATE -- LIKE
I PERSONALLY TOLD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE UPON LEARNING THE UNFORTUNATE
AND TRAGIC NEWS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, AN
ADMIRED FRIEND AND A GREAT COLOMBIAN -- THAT I WANTED TO HOLD THIS
MEETING BECAUSE THE VENEZUELAN FEELINGS WHICH I REPRESENT AND
PERSONIFY COMPELLED ME TO PERSONALLY EXPRESS TO YOU, AS PRESIDENT OF
COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA'S AND THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY WITH THE
EXTRAORDINARY AND ADMIRABLE STRUGGLE THAT COLOMBIA IS CURRENTLY WAGING
AGAINST AN ENEMY OF MANKIND -- DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   I WANT TO STATE HERE THAT THIS WAS ENOUGH REASON FOR THE VENEZUELA
GOVERNMENT TO REQUEST, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, A PERSONAL INTERVIEW
WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SO THAT IT MAY BE KNOWN THAT VENEZUELA'S
SOLIDARITY GOES BEYOND WORDS.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 16 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [EXCERPTS] A DARK CLOUD
OF SKEPTICISM LOOMED OVER THE TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AT THE END OF
THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS TODAY, BECAUSE THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE
DIALOGUE WERE UNABLE, REPEAT UNABLE, TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE BASIC
POINTS FOR A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET AT THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CLARIST NUNS'
CONGREGATION IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   OSCAR ARIAS, THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT AND NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
WINNER, VISITED THE PLACE AND ENCOURAGED THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEET
"BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN WAR IS SENSELESS AND SHOULD NOT, REPEAT SHOULD
NOT, CONTINUE."

   ARIAS ADDED: "I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT IS BETTER THAN DIALOGUE."

   GREGORIO ROSAS CHAVEZ, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR,
STATED: "I FOSTER HOPES THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED."

   WHEN THE MEETING STARTED AND, AFTER THE INITIAL FORMALITIES, THE
REPRESENTATIVES BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE KEY POINTS.

   THE FMLN PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING POINTS AT THE MEETING:

   1. THE NEED TO ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE GENERAL ELECTIONS;

   2. THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONSIGNIOR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S
MURDER TO BE SENT TO TRIAL;

   3. REFORMS TO THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION;

   4. PURGING AND PROFESSIONALIZING THE ARMY;

   5. ENDING REPRESSION;

   6. FULL ENFORCEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS;

   7. REFORMS TO THE SALVADORAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM;

   8. PROVISIONAL ECONOMIC MEASURES TO DEACTIVATE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
CONFRONTATION.

   IN SYNTHESIS, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSED "STOPPING
HOSTILITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE OAS AND
UN DELEGATES."

   JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ, HEAD OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION, ALSO PROPOSED THAT "FMLN MEMBERS BE GIVEN ALL THE REQUIRED
FACILITIES TO RETURN TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC
LIFE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED."

   AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS WAS OVER, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF
THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN DELEGATION, SAID: "WE REACHED NO SPECIFIC
ACCORDS."

   ANOTHER FMLN LEADER SHAFICK HANDAL POINTED OUT THAT "THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO US FOR THE TIME BEING."

   REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT, SALVADORAN JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR
SANTAMARIA SAID: "WE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS; THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS A
SPECIFIC POSITION ON HOW TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE, WHICH IS WHAT THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING."

   AT THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE DEADLOCKED ON AN ESSENTIAL ISSUE -- THE
CEASE-FIRE.

   THE FMLN MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE SHOULD FOLLOW GOVERNMENT
COMPLIANCE WITH A NUMBER OF MEASURES WHILE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
 MAINTAINS THAT A CEASE-FIRE MUST COME BEFORE ANY CHANGES TAKE PLACE.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED AN FMLN PROPOSAL TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS SOON.

   THE FMLN ALSO CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S CEASE-FIRE
PROPOSAL, BECAUSE THAT "WOULD CONSTITUTE SURRENDER."

   "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE, BUT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH CERTAIN STEPS THAT
WE ARE PROPOSING," COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID.

   "WE WANT A CEASE-FIRE FIRST AND THEN NEGOTIATIONS," SALVADORAN
PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ SAID.

   THE SECOND ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE ON 17 OCTOBER AT
1400 GMT.


DEV-MUC3-0580 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL
SALVADOR STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE BASE AND COWARDLY MURDER OF MS DOLORES
ISABEL CASANOVA PORRAS, CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS IN SANTA TECLA AS THE
INNOCENT VICTIM WAS ON HER WAY TO HER SPORTS EXERCISES.  THIS CRIME,
VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN, CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD
THE FMLN IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM
HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING.

   THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS
CONFIRMS THE FMLN IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT
INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER.  CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME
BY FMLN URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN LEADERS IN
COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS
PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM
THE FMLN?

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY CONVEYS ITS DEEP CONDOLENCES AND SOLIDARITY
TO MS CASANOVA PORRAS' FAMILY OVER THIS IRREPARABLE LOSS. MOREOVER, IT
ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS
DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN AT A TIME
WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN
GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE,
SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR.

   THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN ADOPTS A
RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.


DEV-MUC3-0581 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   SAN JOSE, 17 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS
REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CONGREGATION OF
THE NUNS OF ST CLARE IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION
ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN INSISTED THAT
THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN
CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT
MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE
ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT
THE FMLN MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18
OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT "IT COMMITS ITSELF TO HALT
ALL OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS
OF ALL GUERRILLAS SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL,
SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE."

   FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A
SURRENDER ON OUR PART."

   FMLN SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS."

   SAENZ SAID: "SINCE THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES, THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS FOR PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY."

   JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE
FMLN TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE
GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY.

   SANTAMARIA REITERATED: "WE WANT PEACE, AN END TO THE WAR, AND AN
END TO THE KILLING, THE PAIN, AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   UN ENVOY ALVARO SOTO AND OAS ENVOY RICARDO GJIVOJE ARE ATTENDING
THE DIALOGUE AS OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ,
AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA [NAME AS RECEIVED],
DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES STUDIES CENTER.

   FMLN COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY
DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR."

   THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN IS IN THE
HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE
BEING HELD."

   THE FMLN DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN IS
GROUNDLESS."

   THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN, YIELD A LITTLE."

   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE
PRESS RELEASES.

   BOGOTA, 17 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED
THAT RADIO ANNOUNCER DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR WAS ASSASSINATED TODAY IN
MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA.  THIS IS THE SECOND SUCH CRIME TO
SHAKE MEDELLIN IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.

   THE POLICE SAID VARGAS ESCOBAR, 56, WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TWO MEN
RIDING A MOTORCYCLE AS HE ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE AT 1950 (0050 GMT 18
OCTOBER).

   THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THE ASSASSINS FLED AFTER COMMITTING
THE ASSASSINATION.  THEY SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MOTIVE.

   DIEGO VARGAS ESCOBAR HAD WORKED AT CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA
(CARACOL) UNTIL 2 MONTHS AGO, AND SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN WORKING AT
THE VOICE OF AMERICA.

   THE ANNOUNCER'S ASSASSINATION CAME ONLY 12 HOURS AFTER "THE
EXTRADITABLES," THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, GUNNED DOWN
JUDGE HECTOR JIMENEZ RODRIGUEZ IN MEDELLIN, THE COUNTRY'S SECOND MOST
IMPORTANT CITY, LOCATED 250 KM NORTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

   SAN JOSE, 18 OCT 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
TODAY AGREED TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE DIALOGUE AND TO MEET IN OTHER
COUNTRIES EVERY MONTH DESPITE THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT CONVINCE THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY
DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE AND THE FMLN COULD NOT
SUCCEED IN SECURING FROM THE AUTHORITIES "TRUE GUARANTEES" FOR
DEMOCRATIZATION AND SECURITY PRIOR TO ENDING THE ARMED STRUGGLE, THE
PROTAGONISTS OF THE DIALOGUE SEEMED SATISFIED AT THE END OF THE
MEETING.

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP AND
MEDIATOR IN THE TALKS, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT LAST NIGHT'S MEETING WAS
"DIFFICULT YET FRUITFUL" AFTER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
VISITED THE CONVENT SITE OF THE MEETING.

   ARIAS MET FOR A WHILE ON 17 OCTOBER WITH THE DELEGATION MEMBERS AND
THE MEDIATORS AT THE SAINT CLARE CONVENT, WHERE THE DIALOGUE IS TAKING
PLACE, AND SUCCEEDED IN UNBLOCKING THE MEETING, WHICH HAD BEEN BOGGED
DOWN IN THE MORNING, ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ.

   ARIAS, WHO WAS AWARDED THE 1987 NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS PEACE EFFORTS
IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID WHILE LEAVING THE MEETING WITH THE
NEGOTIATORS AND MEDIATORS ON 17 OCTOBER THAT HE WAS MOVED TO INTERVENE
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO "ENCOURAGE THE SIDES TO KEEP NEGOTIATING."

   ARIAS STRESSED THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A RAPID SOLUTION FOR A
PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS LASTED 10 YEARS AND KILLED MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE. HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE IS STILL WILLINGNESS TO SEEK
PEACEFUL WAYS TO END THIS BLOODY CONFRONTATION."

   ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, BOTH SIDES ARE WILLING TO
"GO OVER SOME IDEAS," PRESENTED IN THIS MEETING, AND KEEP ELABORATING
ON THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.

   REGARDING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, WHICH WAS MENTIONED AS THE
MAIN POINT EARLY IN THE MEETING BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BECAUSE
OF A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SIDES, AN ACCORD WAS FINALLY REACHED TO
"CLARIFY" THE MEANING OF THE PHRASE.

   ACCORDING TO FMLN SPOKESMAN JESUS ROJAS, THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION
HAS CONTINUED TO INDICATE THAT "IT HAS NO DECISIONMAKING ABILITY" AND
THIS HAS CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

   CESAR MARTI, ANOTHER FMLN MEMBER, SAID "SUBSTANTIAL ACCORDS" HAVE
NOT BEEN ANTICIPATED, BUT THE "THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN SAVED."

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THE MEETING, THE SECOND SINCE DIRECT CONTACTS WERE
RESUMED IN MEXICO CITY IN SEPTEMBER ENDS TODAY.

   TODAY IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED WHERE AND WHEN THE 3D MEETING WILL BE
HELD, PERHAPS IN CARACAS, ALTHOUGH THE REBELS INSIST THAT THE MEETING
SITE SHOULD BE SAN SALVADOR.

   LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERU HAS GIVEN BOLIVIA FREE ZONES
IN TWO PERUVIAN PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT COUNTRY'S ACCESS TO THE SEA.
BOLIVIA LOST ITS PACIFIC COASTLINE IN A WAR AGAINST CHILE IN 1879.

   THIS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED DURING A MEETING BETWEEN PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA ON BOARD
A SHIP ANCHORED ON THE HIGHEST LAKE IN THE WORLD, LAKA TITICACA.

   "IT HAS BEEN A FRUITFUL MEETING BECAUSE WE AGREED ON SEVERAL ISSUES
THAT GO BEYOND THE RHETORIC OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS," THE PERUVIAN
CHIEF OF STATE SAID AFTER THE SESSION.

   "WE MET TO DEFINITIVELY IMPLEMENT AN OLD PERUVIAN OFFERING," GARCIA
ADDED.

   ACCORDING TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THAT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, THE FREE ZONES ARE LOCATED IN THE PORTS
OF MATARANI AND ILO, IN SOUTHERN PERU, IN KEEPING WITH AN OFFER MADE
BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1979.

   THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BOLIVIA HAS GAINED ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
IN PERUVIAN PORTS. THE ONLY FREE PORT BOLIVIA PREVIOUSLY HAD ACCESS TO
WAS THE CHILEAN PORT OF IQUIQUE.

   AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE BOLIVIAN FREE ZONE LOCATIONS
AREAS, AND OPERATIONS SYSTEMS IN PERUVIAN PORTS WILL BE DEFINED DURING
A MEETING OF BOLIVIAN AND PERUVIAN EXPERTS, WHO MUST PREPARE PROPOSALS
WITHIN 60 DAYS.

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS DECIDED TO CREATE A MARITIME TRANSPORTATION
COMPANY WITH TWO COMPANIES FROM EACH COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENTS
INSTRUCTED THEIR DECLARATION, THE CHIEFS OF STATE DECIDED THAT
PERUVIAN LEAD AND SILVER CONCENTRATE WILL BE PROCESSED IN BOLIVIAN
METAL PLANTS. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO CREATE A BINATIONAL COMPANY TO
MARKET MINERALS.

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS, THE COMMUNIQUE STATES, "EXPRESSED THEIR WILL TO
PROMOTE THE CREATION IN THE FUTURE OF A BINATIONAL MINISTRY FOR THE
COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE HIGH PLATEAU REGION SHARED
BY THE TWO COUNTRIES."

   GARCIA AND PAZ ZAMORA RATIFIED "THEIR CONVICTION TO CARRY OUT
BILATERAL TRADE WITHIN THE ANDEAN INTEGRATION PROGRAM," AND THE
PERUVIAN ADMINISTRATION PROMISED TO GRANT BOLIVIA FACILITIES "TO
ENCOURAGE TRADE OF BOLIVIAN AGRICULTURE AND AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS."

   ON THE SUBJECT OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, THE TWO PRESIDENTS "REITERATED
THEIR POLITICAL WILL" TO COORDINATE ACTIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL DRUG
TRAFFICKING, ACCORDING TO THE COMMITMENT ASSUMED ON 10 OCTOBER BY
GARCIA, PAZ ZAMORA, AND COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN THE
PERUVIAN CITY OF ICA.

   BOLIVIA AND PERU ARE TWO OF THE WORLD'S MAIN PRODUCERS OF COCA
LEAVES, THE RAW MATERIAL FOR MAKING COCAINE, OF WHICH 80 PERCENT IS
PROCESSED IN COLOMBIAN LABORATORIES.

   THE TWO CHIEFS OF STATE ALSO DECIDED TO "REVIEW AND MODERNIZE"
PUBLIC TRANSIT BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRIES "IN KEEPING WITH
HISTORICAL, GEOGRAPHIC, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS" BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND
 PERU.

   IN A REMARKABLE SIDELIGHT, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA DECIDED TO RENAME
THE PERUVIAN SHIP "OLLANATA," WHERE THE MEETING TOOK PLACE, THE "GREAT
MARSHAL ANDRES DE SANTA CRUZ," AFTER THE FIFTH BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT AND
SPONSOR OF THE PERUVIAN- BOLIVIAN CONFEDERATION.

   ONE OF THE AGREEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 18-POINT FINAL DECLARATION
STATES THAT BOLIVIA WILL BE ABLE TO SEND NAVY OFFICERS WITH THE NEXT
PERUVIAN MISSION TO ANTARCTICA.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WAS HELD ON THE WATERS OF LAKE TITICACA,
3,800 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL.

   A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY AT DAWN IN THE PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, NEAR
THE LAKE, VERY NEAR WHERE THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WAS TO TAKE PLACE.

   ALTHOUGH THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES, THE LOCAL
POLICE STATION DID SUSTAIN SOME PROPERTY DAMAGE.

SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES WERE ADOPTED AT THE CONGRESS TODAY.  ONLY
PARLIAMENTARIANS, JOURNALISTS, AND EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE
BUILDING.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS BEEN BANNED.  THESE MEASURES WERE
IMPLEMENTED AFTER A PAID ASSASSIN WAS KILLED RIGHT IN BOLIVAR SQUARE
BY A GRENADE HE WAS TRYING TO THROW AT THE CONGRESS BUILDING.

   THE ABORTED ACTION BY THE TERRORIST ON 18 OCTOBER FORCED THE
AUTHORITIES TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT THE CONGRESS. HOWEVER, BOLIVAR
SQUARE WAS POORLY PATROLLED.  SEVERAL ONLOOKERS ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE
EARLY THIS MORNING TO SEE WHERE THE TERRORIST WAS KILLED WHEN THE
GRENADE EXPLODED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SECURITY OFFICER] THOSE WHO CANNOT
SHOW PROPER IDENTITY CARDS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS?

   [OFFICER] YES, ANYONE WHO HAS LEGITIMATE BUSINESS HERE AT THE
CONGRESS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MEASURES CAUSED VARIOUS REACTIONS AND ANGERED SOME CONGRESSMEN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] WHY WAS THIS SENATOR NOT ADMITTED?

   [OFFICER] BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO BE SEARCHED, AS EVERYBODY MUST BE.

   [UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN] SEARCHING CONGRESSMEN IS NOT VERY NICE,
BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE IF ONE WERE KILLED.  [END RECORDING]

   EMPLOYEES DID NOT ESCAPE THE CHECK EITHER.  THE POLICE EVEN
CORDONED OFF THE OUTSIDE AREAS NEAR WHERE THE COMMISSIONS WORK.

[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] ...WHICH IS THE
OVERALL RESULT, BUT ALSO ANALYZED THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MEETING WAS
HELD BECAUSE WE BELIEVE, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, THAT THE PEOPLE
MUST BE INFORMED, THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THE TRUTH.  INITIALLY, THIS
SECOND MEETING WITH THE FMLN IS A FOLLOWUP TO THE MEXICO ACCORD IN
SEPTEMBER.

   WE WANT TO BEGIN BY BRIEFLY EXPLAINING WHAT THE MEXICO ACCORD WAS,
PARTICULARLY WHAT WE AGREED TO DISCUSS IN THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA.  WE HAVE HERE THE TEXT OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, AND IN THE
CHAPTER CONCERNING THE NEXT MEETING IT SAYS: THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
WILL BE THE END OF HOSTILITIES, BASED ON PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].

   IN VIEW OF THE MEXICO ACCORD, OUR DELEGATION BEGAN TO WORK ON A
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO OUTLINE WHAT COULD
BE AN END TO HOSTILITIES.  WHY HAVE WE INSISTED ON THIS TOPIC?
BECAUSE WE WANT AN END TO VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY, THE END OF WEAPONS
FIRING, THE END OF BOMB EXPLOSIONS, THE END OF MINES MUTILATING THE
LITTLE HANDS AND FEET OF CHILDREN IN RURAL AREAS.  WE WANT TO SEE AN
END TO THE DESTRUCTION OF EL SALVADOR, AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY
AND TRANQUILITY WITH GREATER POSSIBILITIES FOR THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   THAT IS THE PHILOSPHY, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, AND EACH ONE OF YOU AS PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, DO NOT
DESERVE THIS VIOLENT SITUATION, THIS HOSTILE SITUATION GENERATED BY
THE ARMED GROUPS OF THE FMLN.

   THE PROPOSAL IS ALSO BASED ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN,
ESQUIPULAS II, AND THE SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE FIVE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL THE TELA
AGREEMENT, THE LAST AGREEMENT.  IN PART III, THE AGREEMENT READS AS
FOLLOWS:

   THE FMLN IS STRONGLY URGED TO END HOSTILITIES IN AN IMMEDIATE AND
EFFECTIVE MANNER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO GIVING UP THE
ARMED STRUGGLE; THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC LIFE.

DEV-MUC3-0588 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 89 -- [TEXT] RUBEN ZAMORA, LEADER OF THE
POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, WAS
UNHARMED FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK.

   ZAMORA SAID THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM A WAVE OF VIOLENCE
LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE
ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND
ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE SAID THESE GROUPS TEND TO REACT WITH INCREASED VIOLENCE.


DEV-MUC3-0589 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE FMLN HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSIST ON AN IMMEDIATE
ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS.  LOGICALLY, I CANNOT SAY THAT THEIR'S IS A
SERIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE PUT FORWARD, A
PERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE FMLN
IMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD
NOT ACCEPT IT.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN NO LONGER WANTS TO
TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW
TOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING.

   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT
BEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST
GLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD.  I
WILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN HAS ADMITTED TO
BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A
TOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT.  IT CANNOT
MAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN PROPOSAL
ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

   WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE
THAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE.  THE RESULTS OF THE PAST
ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT [WON BY THE
DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE], INDICATE THAT THE FMLN IS A REALITY BUT A
VERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A
GOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT
THE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE [MILITARY] CLASS OF '66, THE
DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE.  THAT IS TOTALLY
ABSURD, IT IS A RIDICULOUS POSITION THAT DOES NOT TRULY SHOW ANY
INTENTION TO MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE.  THE FMLN PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR
THE GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO CHANGE ALL OF
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.  THESE, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, ARE TOTALLY
ABSURD POSITIONS; ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, THEIR
PREVIOUS POSITIONS ARE EVER PRESENT.

   THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT AT ANY TIME VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION, IT
WILL NEVER QUESTION THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND ALL THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE MADE DURING THESE LONG YEARS IN ORDER TO GRADUALLY
STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WHICH MAY NOT BE PERFECT -- AND WE
WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS DIFFERENT WAYS OF PERFECTING IT -- BUT WE WILL
NEVER SELL IT OR SACRIFICE IT, ESPECIALLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH,
BY ALL MEANS, ARE ABSURD.

   WHAT IS WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT ALONG WITH THE ATTITUDE THE FMLN
HAS DISPLAYED IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH ITS REJECTION OF EVERYTHING
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, ITS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY THE AGENDA WE HAD AGREED
UPON IN MEXICO, ITS EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS, AND
ITS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS, IT HAS INITIATED A STRATEGY OF
MURDERS HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  EVERYONE HAS NOTICED; THEY MURDERED A
REPORTER'S WIFE AND SON.  WHY?  BECAUSE THEY HAD A RELATIVE IN THE
ARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE MURDERED AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL, AT A SAFE
DISTANCE, IN A COWARDLY MANNER, ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS A RELATIVE OF
 AN ARMED FORCES MEMBER.  YESTERDAY THEY ATTEMPTED TO MURDER A FORMER
MILITARY MAN WHO ALSO HAS A RELATIVE IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN INTENDS TO TALK OVER
THERE [COSTA RICA] AND TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CASE OUT OF ITS DEFENDING
HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE MURDERING PEOPLE AND VIOLATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS
THEY CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING, ON A DAILY BASIS.  ALL OF THESE FMLN
ATTITUDES FORCE US TO DIALOGUE, AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, I MUST
BE COMPLETELY CLEAR AND OPEN.  I MUST TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE
TRUTH.

   I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR THE FMLN HAS NOT DISPLAYED THE POLITICAL
RESOLVE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  FIRST OF ALL, THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO
TALK ABOUT ENDING THE CONFLICT, IT DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY -- YOU AND I, MY DEAR VIEWERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP
LIVING IN THIS WHIRLPOOL OF VIOLENCE, TO LIVE IN PEACE, AND TO ALLOW
THE PROCESS TO PROGRESS IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL
GRADUALLY GIVE US FIRM AND LASTING PEACE, WITHIN AN ATMOSPHERE OF
TRANQUILITY.

   THE FMLN'S ATTITUDE IS ONE OF PROVOCATION.  IT WANTS TO PROVOKE THE
GOVERNMENT INTO GETTING UP FROM THE DIALOGUE TABLE; IT HAS TRIED TO
ANGER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION BY INSULTING THEM.  ALL IN ALL,
THE FMLN IS TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DESIST.  WHY ARE THEY
SEEKING THIS?  BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT IS A LITTLE MORE IMAGE, THE IMAGE
THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE THEIR SPACES HAVE BEEN CLOSED.
NO ONE IN THE WORLD WILL CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY AN ARMED STRUGGLE.  THAT
IS A THING OF THE PAST.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0590 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 20 OCT 89 -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] PRESIDENT ARIAS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT PERHAPS FIDEL
CASTRO IS THE ONLY ONE WHO INSISTS ON THE SITUATION -- AND WHO SEEMS
TO HAVE NOT YET RETURNED FROM THE SIERRA MAESTRA WHERE HE WAS IN 1959.
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ATTITUDE OF THE FMLN LEADERS.  WHAT ELSE DO THE
ARMED FORCES, I MEAN [CORRECTS HIMSELF], DOES THE FMLN WANT WITH ALL
THESE ABSURD PROPOSALS AND ATTITUDES?  IT IS SEEKING TO DIVIDE THE
ARMED FORCES.  IT IS SEEKING TO ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC.  IT WANTS TO [DISCREDIT] THE GOVERNMENT IMAGE, WHICH HAS
BEEN CONSOLIDATED LITTLE BY LITTLE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BECAUSE
WE ARE SHOWING TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS A DEMOCRACY HERE, THAT A
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS BEING CONSOLIDATED, AND THAT THE FORCES THAT
ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM ARE FORCES THAT TRULY WANT
AND SEEK PEACE, RATHER THAN FORCES THAT ASSASSINATE AND CAUSE
DESTRUCTION.  THEREFORE, WE CAN NO LONGER THINK AT THIS MOMENT, THAT
THE FMLN HAS ONLY VIEWED THE DIALOGUE FROM A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW.

   HOWEVER, WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.  ALL THIS STRATEGY SHOULD NOT
CONFUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST BE CALM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT GIVE AN INCH AND WILL CONTINUE, THROUGH
RATIONAL MEANS, TO STRUGGLE AND SEARCH FOR PEACE, TO WHICH YOU AND ALL
SALVADORANS ARE ENTITLED.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THE TRAPS THE
FMLN IS TRYING TO PUT BEFORE US.  HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT WE
SHOULD SEE IS WHO WANTS PEACE AND WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEARCH FOR
PEACE.  UP TO THIS MOMENT, THE FMLN HAS GIVEN NO EVIDENCE IT WANTS TO
ATTAIN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY FOR YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST NOT BE PESSIMISTIC.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT
ONE CANNOT SAY, FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, THAT OUTSTANDING RESULTS WERE
OBTAINED AT THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, SOME RESULTS WERE
ATTAINED.  THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT SHOULD
ELIMINATE ALL TRACES OF PESSIMISM.  WE MUST THINK THAT THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO WAS NOT BROKEN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA,
AND THAT THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE NEXT MONTH IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.
THE ISSUE AGAIN WILL BE CEASING HOSTILITIES.  WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND
MORE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, AND THERE IS LESS ROOM TO PLAY
STRATEGIC GAMES WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY SUBJECT IN THIS
DIALOGUE PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.
WHEN WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, SUCH AGREEMENTS MUST BE RESPECTED.  THAT
IS THE ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IF THERE IS A TRUE POLITICAL
DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THEREFORE, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY
MESSAGE BY MAKING AN APPEAL FOR UNITY.  WE MUST BE UNITED FOR PEACE.
ALL SECTORS -- POLITICAL, LABOR, RELIGIOUS, AND BUSINESS -- MUST
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN SHOW A TRUE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  WE MUST
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN STOP TRYING TO USE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR FOR
STRATEGIC PURPOSES.  IF THE FMLN TRULY WANTS PEACE, WHY DOES IT
CONTINUE TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS -- PROBABLY
 FROM NICARAGUA -- INTO EL SALVADOR.  TODAY, A TRUCK FROM NICARAGUA
LOADED WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE FMLN WAS CONFISCATED AT THE
BORDER WITH HONDURAS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS NOT YET SERIOUSLY
SEARCHING FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE UNITY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD FORCE THE FMLN TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  THE
UNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD CLOSE POLITICAL SPACE SO THE
[FMLN] WILL STOP ITS STRATEGIC GAMES.  ALL OF US, UNITED, SHOULD
DEMAND THAT THE FMLN TAKE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS SERIOUSLY, EQUALLY AS
SERIOUSLY AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE MUST
SEARCH THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS TO HAVE PEACE AND CALM IN EL SALVADOR.

   SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US NOT DISMAY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM.  THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM,
THERE WILL BE OBSTACLES, IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE
ALWAYS SAID YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR PEACE
AND WILL NOT CEASE TO WORK FOR PEACE.

   MAY GOD BLESS YOU.  GOOD EVENING.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS, SALVADORAN DEFENSE AND PUBLIC
SECURITY MINISTER, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [LARIOS] THIS HAS
REALLY BEEN AN AGREEMENT THAT REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERESTS, AS
WELL AS THE INTERESTS OF THE TERRORIST FRONT.  IN THIS RESPECT, WE
AGREE WITH THE TEXT OF THE SAN JOSE ACCORD.

   [REPORTER] AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD YESTERDAY AT THE UND, THE
NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION, IT WAS SAID THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF
TWO U.S. ADVISERS AND ONE U.S. MILITARY ADVISER PREVENTED GREATER
PROGRESS IN THE DIALOGUE.  HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

   [LARIOS] WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT TERRORISTS TRY TO CONFUSE AND
TRY TO FOSTER AN ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS IN THE PEOPLE SOLELY TO JUSTIFY
THEMSELVES.  AT NO TIME WAS THE MILITARY DELEGATION, WHICH
PARTICIPATED AS ADVISERS IN THE DIALOGUE, ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE
DECISIONS OF THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION.  THEIR ROLE AS ADVISERS ENABLED
THEM TO GIVE ADVICE TO THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION, BUT IT IS ABSURD TO
THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF OUR TWO MILITARY ADVISERS AND OTHER
ADVISERS PREVENTED REAL AND COMPLEX POSITIONS FROM BEING TAKEN AT THAT
MEETING.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS NO U.S. ADVISER...

   [LARIOS, INTERRUPTING] MOREOVER, WE CANNOT.... [CHANGES THOUGHT] NO
U.S. ADVISER ACCOMPANIED OUR DELEGATION.  IF THERE WAS ONE, HE WENT
STRICTLY ON HIS OWN.  YOUR QUESTION, THEREFORE, IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
IT ALLOWS US TO TELL YOU THAT THE SALVADORAN MILITARY DELEGATION NEVER
HAMPERED THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION DURING THE TALKS.

   [REPORTER] THE NONGOVERNMENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION PRESENTED THE
RELATIVES OF TORTURED AND CAPTURED PERSONS.  IT ACCUSED 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE COMMANDER FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES AND OTHER OFFICERS OF HAVING
TIES TO THE DEATH SQUADS.

   [LARIOS] I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THESE KINDS OF REPORTS OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS.  FRIENDS -- AND HERE I AM APPEALING TO MY FRIENDS --
LET US NOT ALLOW THE TERRORISTS' DESPERATE ACTIONS TO CONFUSE AND
CONVEY A FALSE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE.  THE FACT IS THAT THIS IS PART
OF THE STRATEGY OF DECEIT, LIES, AND DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE TERRORISTS.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [LARIOS] LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS IS PART OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
STRATEGY.  WE MUST NOT BE DECEIVED.  WE KNOW FULL WELL WHO THE PERSONS
ARE WHO ARE TRYING TO SOW MISTRUST AND CONFUSION AMONG CIVILIANS.  WE
ARE A RESPONSIBLE, SERIOUS, AND FORMAL INSTITUTION.  IT IS UP TO US TO
INVESTIGATE ALL THESE VIOLENT INCIDENTS AND DEATHS.  WE WILL DO OUR
DUTY BY CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 20 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] TODAY,
WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A VERY PAINFUL EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN
BARRANQUILLA.  BARRANQUILLA RESIDENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED TONIGHT
FOLLOWING THIS AFTERNOON'S CAR BOMB EXPLOSION, WHICH WOUNDED AT LEAST
10 PERSONS AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHEN A
CAR FILLED WITH TOURISTS WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL HOTEL.
FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO FATALITIES.  OFFICIALS CAPTURED ONE OF THE
TERRORISTS; HIS NAME IS JOSE RAMIREZ, AGED 24, AND HE IS FROM ARMENIA.
ANOTHER TERRORIST WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CAR BOMBING IS STILL AT
LARGE.

   BOGOTA, 20 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT]
AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL SUCCESSFUL BLOWS AGAINST TERRORISM.
CAPTURED TODAY WERE TWO [AS HEARD] EXTRADITABLES AND ONE BOMB PLANTER,
WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE HERE ARE CALLING THESE TERRORISTS.

   THE TERRORIST, WHO GIVES HIS NAME AS GONZALO PINZON LAGOS, 24, WAS
CAPTURED BY DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS].
HE CONFESSED TO PARTICIPATING IN BOMB ATTACKS EARLY THIS MONTH AGAINST
THE ENERGY TOWERS LOCATED AT ROJAS AVENUE AND 75TH STREET AND IN
CAFAN SARSAMORA.  A TERRORIST WORKING FOR THE JOHN BOLANOS LOPEZ
GANG WAS KILLED IN THIS ATTACK.  RICARDO BOLANOS RODRIGUEZ, THE GANG
LEADER'S FATHER, WAS ALSO ARRESTED.  HE IS ACCUSED OF RECRUITING
TERRORISTS.  THIS MORNING, HE WAS GOING TO PUT A BOMB AT THE AZULEJOS
CORONA STORE, ALONG THE MEDELLIN SPEEDWAY.

   AN EXTRADITABLE WAS CAPTURED BY THE POLICE WHILE HE WAS IN THE
CERREJON INSTALLATIONS, IN THE TOWN OF MAICAO, GUAJIRA INTENDANCY.  HE
COMES FROM BARRANQUILLA AND IS IDENTIFIED AS ROBERT JAMIS
SOCOLOGUISQUI SALA.  THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS REQUESTING HIS
EXTRADITION, BUT MEANWHILE HE WILL REMAIN AT DIJIN INSTALLATIONS.


DEV-MUC3-0594 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   LONDON (UK), 19 OCT 89 (BEIJING XINHUA) -- [TEXT] BRITAIN AND
ARGENTINA TODAY AGREED TO RESUME THEIR CONSULAR RELATIONS AND DIRECT
AIR AND SEA LINKS SEVERED DURING THEIR WAR OVER SOVEREIGNTY OF THE
MALVINAS (FALKLANDS) ISLANDS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

   AFTER THREE DAYS OF SUBSTANTIVE TALKS IN MADRID, THE TWO COUNTRIES
AGREED "TO LIFT ALL REMAINING RESTRICTIONS" ON TRADE AND FINANCIAL
EXCHANGES, SAID A JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED HERE TODAY.

   THEY ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO NORMALIZE THEIR TIES "WITH A VIEW TO
RESUMING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS," IT SAID.

   THE DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD BETWEEN BRITISH NEGOTIATOR CRISPIN
TICKELL, BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, AND VETERAN
ARGENTINE DIPLOMAT LUCIO GARCIA DE SOLAR.

   THE TALKS, ARRANGED AFTER THE TWO SPECIAL ENVOYS MET IN NEW YORK IN
AUGUST, WERE EXTENDED A DAY BEYOND ITS TWO-DAY SCHEDULE.

   THEY AGREED TO HOLD FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS TO STRIVE FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BROKEN DURING
THE 1982 MALVINAS WAR. THE NEXT SUBSTANTIVE MEETING WILL BE HELD ON
FEBRUARY 14-15, 1990.

   DURING THE MADRID TALKS, THE TWO COUNTRIES PUT ASIDE THE
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS,
WHICH BLOCKED THEIR FIRST RECONCILIATION ATTEMPT IN BERN, SWITZERLAND,
IN 1984.

   THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THAT THE TALKS ALLOWED BOTH SIDES TO HOLD THEIR
RESPECTIVE POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS AND
THAT NOTHING OF THEIR AGREEMENT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A CHANGE IN
THEIR POSITIONS.

   AS REGARDS FISHERIES, THE COMMUNIQUE SAID, BOTH DELEGATIONS HAD
DIFFERENT POSITIONS BUT AGREED "TO SET UP A WORKING GROUP WITH A VIEW
TO MAKING PROPOSALS" TO BE SUBMITTED TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.

   ARGENTINA HOPES FOR THE LIFTING OF THE 150-MILE (240-KILOMETER)
EXCLUSIVE ZONE AROUND THE MALVINAS ISLANDS IMPOSED BY BRITAIN AFTER
THE 10-WEEK WAR, WHICH KILLED MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE.

   A BRITISH TRADE MISSION WILL VISIT ARGENTINA FROM NOVEMBER 27 TO
DECEMBER 1, THIS YEAR, AND A NEW CULTURAL AGREEMENT COULD BE EXPECTED
AS NORMALIZATION ADVANCED FURTHER, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT.

   LINKS AND CONTACTS BETWEEN THE FALKLANDS AND THE CONTINENTAL
MAINLAND WOULD BE DEVELOPED AS BENEFICIAL.

   BRITAIN ALSO AGREED TO HELP ARGENTINA ESTABLISH ITS COOPERATIVE
LINKS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS REJECTED COMMERCIAL TIES
WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ITS UNNORMALIZED RELATIONS
WITH BRITAIN. BRITAIN IS ONE OF THE 12 MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY.

   DESCRIBING THE AGREEMENT AS REMARKABLE, TICKELL, THE BRITISH CHIEF
NEGOTIATOR, SAID: "WE HAVE TAKEN A VERY LARGE STEP TOWARDS DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS ... WE ARE NOT THERE YET."

   ARGENTINE NEGOTIATOR DEL SOLAR EXPRESSED OPTIMISM FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF FULL DIPLOMATIC TIES AND SAID: "MY IMPRESSION IS THAT
THIS WILL NOT BE TOO LONG."

   THE ANGLO-ARGENTINE RAPPROCHEMENT WAS INITIATED BY ARGENTINA'S
PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, WHO TOOK OFFICE IN JULY. MENEM SAID ON THE
SECOND DAY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION THAT TALKS COULD BE RESUMED ON
RESTORATION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITHOUT
DISCUSSING SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE MALVINAS ISLANDS.

   HE VOICED THE HOPE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS COULD RESUME BY
CHRISTMAS, A TIMETABLE THAT BRITAIN SAID IS EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS.

   HOWEVER, OBSERVERS HERE SAID THE MADRID AGREEMENT HAS PAVED THE WAY
FOR BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT TOUCHING THE
THORNY ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ISLANDS.

   BY REACHING THE AGREEMENT, BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE TAKEN A
STRIDE TOWARD RECONCILIATION, THEY SAID.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,
TODAY SAID THAT THE WEAPONS CONFISCATED BY HONDURAN TROOPS WERE SENT
FROM NICARAGUA AND INTENDED FOR THE URBAN PONCE REFERRED TO THE RECENT
SEIZURE OF WEAPONS FROM A VAN WITH A SALVADORAN LICENSE PLATE WHICH
WERE SENT BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT VIA COSTA RICA TO THE FMLN.  HE
SAID THAT THE ARSENAL INCLUDED A LARGE QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES AND HIGH
CALIBER WEAPONS THAT WERE HIDDEN IN SECRET COMPARTMENTS OF THE VAN,
WHICH WAS CARRYING FURNITURE FOR A SALVADORAN FAMILY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THIS DEMONSTRATES ONCE MORE THAT THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES SUPPORTING THE FMLN STRUGGLE AND IS
DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE URBAN COMMANDOS, WHICH ARE THE FMLN DEATH
SQUADS IN THIS CITY.  THESE MANUALS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN NICARAGUA
AND BEAR THE FMLN LETTERHEAD.  THEY ARE INTENDED FOR THE URBAN
COMMANDOS AND INCLUDE TACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL AS DIRECTIONS ON
HOW TO USE ARMS.  [END RECORDING]

   IN ADDITION, COL PONCE SHOWED A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SEIZED AT EL
TIGRE HILL, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, ON 30 JULY, DEALING WITH MILITARY
THEORY AND URBAN WAR WHICH, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THE DOCUMENT SAYS THE FOLLOWING IN ONE OF
ITS PARAGRAPHS: THE WAR AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES MUST BE TOTAL AND MUST
REACH THEIR PROPERTIES, FAMILIES, HOMES, WORK PLACES, AND VACATION
RETREATS. WE MUST ALWAYS GIVE PRIORITY TO EXECUTIONS, BUT HARASSMENT,
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, ETC, ARE ALSO PART OF THIS POLICY AND MAY BE
CARRIED OUT BY THE LESS EXPERIENCED ECHELONS TO DEVELOP EXPERIENCE IN
USING WEAPONS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE CLAIM THAT WAS MADE BY THE
TERRORIST RINGLEADERS IN COSTA RICA IS NOT VALID.  IT IS NOT TRUE THAT
THEY DISAGREE WITH THIS LINE.  [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO PONCE'S STATEMENTS, THE ACTIONS UNCOVERED BY MILITARY
INTELLIGENCE ARE TOTALLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLES IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BECAUSE THEY TALK ABOUT
REACHING PEACE BUT THEIR ACTIONS SHOW THE CONTRARY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 OCT 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] THE ARSENAL
CONFISCATED IN HONDURAS CONFIRMS THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT VIOLATION OF
THE TELA AGREEMENTS.  [COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE] CHAIRMAN OF THE
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF SAID THE COMMUNISTS ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED
BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SERIOUSNESS AND GOODWILL OF
OTHERS.

   COL PONCE EXPLAINED HOW THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES DISCOVERED THE
COMING FROM NICARAGUA.  HE SAID THE TRUCK WAS FIRST SENT TO COSTA RICA
IN ORDER TO CONFUSE THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES.  THE CARGO SEEMED TO BE
FURNITURE EARMARKED FOR A SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN, PONCE SAID.

   THE WEAPONS WERE DISCOVERED BY A HONDURAN SOLDIER AT THE BORDER

COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT CONTINUES VIOLATING ITS OWN COMMITMENTS BY
SENDING WEAPONS TO OUR COUNTRY SO REBELS CONTINUE KILLING OTHER
SALVADORANS.
 


DEV-MUC3-0599 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BUENOS AIRES, 19 OCT 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] AFTER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
MENEM, FORMER MONTONEROS CHIEFS FERNANDO VACA NARVAJA AND ROBERTO
CIRILO PERDIA HAVE STATED THAT THEY WILL BECOME "LEADERS" OF THE
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MOVEMENT AND ENTIRELY SUPPORT THE JUSTICIALIST
GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM.

   THE MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FACTION OF THE PERONIST MOVEMENT
HAVE ASKED PRESIDENT MENEM TO PARDON MONTONEROS LEADER MARIO
FIRMENICH, WHO IS CURRENTLY BEING HELD AT THE CASEROS PRISON.  VACA
NARVAJA AND PERDIA ALSO ANNOUNCEDS THE THEY WILL ASK FOR A MEETING
WITH ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL ISIDRO CACERES, PJ [JUSTICIALIST
PARTY] LEADER ANTONIO CAFIERO, AND TOP LEADERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
WITH THE GOAL OF "ACHIEVING NATIONAL RECONCILIATION."

   VACA NARVAJA AND PERDIA WENT TO GOVERNMENT HOUSE TODAY AT NOON TO
THANK PRESIDENT MENEM FOR THEIR PARDON AND TO EXPRESS "OUR COMMITMENT
TO DO WHATEVER POSSIBLE TO STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
AND NATIONAL UNITY."  THIS REMARK WAS MADE BY VACA NARVAJA TO SOME 50
JOURNALISTS GATHERED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRESS ROOM.  HE TOLD THE
JOURNALISTS THAT PRESIDENT MENEM RECEIVED THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY
WILL ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO ARGENTINES.  HE ALSO ASKED THEM
TO JOIN THE PRODUCTIVE REVOLUTION.  INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA
WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE 40-MINUTE MEETING.

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, THE RECENTLY PARDONED MONTONEROS
LEADERS POINTED OUT THAT THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO PARDON MARIO
FIRMENICH.  THEY IMPLICITY ADMITTED THAT THE MILITARY MEN WHO LED THE
PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION COULD BE RELEASED.

   VACA NARVAJA SAID IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION THAT THE MONTONEROS
"HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT AT THE LUJAN BASILICA NATIONAL SANCTUARY," AND
THAT "IT IS NOT POSSIBLE -- NOR IT IS CORRECT OR JUST -- TO CARRY OUT
ARMED OR CLANDESTINE ACTIONS WHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE FULLY
EFFECTIVE."

   ASKED ABOUT THE MONEY COLLECTED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF IMPRESARIO
JORGE BORN, ROBERTO PERDIA SAID THAT "THIS MATTER WAS NOT DISCUSSED"
WITH PRESIDENT MENEM.  "WE MAINTAIN OUR DECISION THAT THE FUNDS WILL
BECOME AVAILABLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS
TROUBLING OUR PEOPLE," PERDIA ADDED.

   PERDIA ALSO NOTED THAT "MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN OBVIOUS SIGNS
OF UNDERSTANDING THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE AND OF WORKING FOR THE FINAL
PACIFICATION."

   ASKED IF THE MONEY OBTAINED FROM THE KIDNAPPING OF BORN WOULD BE
RETURNED, PERDIA RESPONDED THAT "IT WILL BE RETURNED TO PEOPLE WHO CAN
BEST USE IT; WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE CAN REFUSE OR BLOCK THIS MONEY
FROM BEING RETURNED TO ITS LEGITIMATE OWNERS, THE PEOPLE, WHO BUILT
THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH WITH THEIR LABOR."

   REGARDING THE SUBJECT OF MISSING PERSONS AND IN RESPONSE TO A
QUESTION ON WHETHER THIS "WAS A CLOSED CASE," PERDIA EMPHASIZED THAT
"IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK IN THE FUTURE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO
ARE ALIVE AND TO BUILD THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FORGETTING THE PAST."
PERDIA ALSO SADI THAT "PAST EVENTS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE PEOPLE'S
CONSCIENCE, IN THE PEOPLE'S MEMORY, SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL
LEARN OUR GOOD AND EVIL EXPERIENCES."

   WHEN A CAMERAMEN FROM A FOREIGN TELEVISION STATION ASKED HIM WHEN
THE MONTONEROS WOULD RETURN THEIR WEAPONS, PERDIA SAID THAT "WE HAVE
NOT USED WEAPONS SINCE 1983" BECAUSE "WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THERE
IS NO ROOM FOR WEAPONS WHENEVER THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC WAYS."

   BUT THE CAMERAMEN LOUDLY INSISTED: WHERE ARE THE WEAPONS?  PERDIA
RESPONDED: "THERE ARE NO WEAPONS.  THEY WERE USED IN COMBAT WHEN THERE
WAS A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM IN A
DEMOCRACY."

   VACA NARVAJA POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE OF NOT TAKING UP ARMS
"LIES IN THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE ARGENTINA HAS SAID 'NEVER
AGAIN' TO MILITARY COUPS AND GUERRILLA WARFARE."

   "THE SECOND GUARANTEE IS THAT THE POLITICAL STEPS THAT WE TAKE
BEFORE THE PEOPLE MUST BE CREDIBLE ENOUGH; THEREFORE, SOME TIME MUST
PASS FOR OUR ACTIONS TO BE CONFIRMED," VACA NARVAJA ADDED.

   CONCLUDING, THE TWO MONTONEROS LEADERS PERFORMED A SELF- CRITICISM
OF THE MONTONEROS ORGANIZATION, STATING THAT IT WENT UNDERGROUD "IN AN
UNTIMELY FASHION, BECAUSE THERE WERE STILL SOVEREIGN WAYS LEFT FOR THE
PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES."

DEV-MUC3-0602 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 23 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GROUP OF "EXTRADITABLES" IN
COLOMBIA, BELIEVED TO BE THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SAID
TODAY THAT IT IS PREPARED TO DECLARE A TRUCE IF THE CONGRESS OF THE
REPUBLIC FORMS A "GRAND COMMISSION ON A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE."

   THE TRAFFICKERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WHO ALONG WITH THE MEMBERS
OF THE CALI CARTEL FORM THE MOST IMPORTANT COCAINE PROCESSING AND
DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD, MADE THEIR PROPOSAL IN A
LETTER ADDRESSED TO LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" SAY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION MUST INCLUDE,
AMONG OTHER PEOPLE, CARDINALS MARIO REVOLLO Y BRAVO AND ALFONSO LOPEZ
TRUJILLO, MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN
VALLEJO ARBALAEZ, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS JIMENEZ GOMEZ, AND
FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN GUIDO PARRA MONTOYA.  THE "GRAND COMMISSION"
MUST ALSO INCLUDE "REPRESENTATIVES OF LEFTIST MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND
THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND SHOULD SEEK A TRUCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT
WING AND THE LEFT WING," ACCORDING TO THE LETTER.

   THE DRUG KINGPINS SAID THAT THEY "AGREE THAT THE TOPIC OF
EXTRADITION SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE REFERENDUM," BECAUSE "WE DO
NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MOBILIZING THE MASSES IN THE STRUGGLE
CONCERNING THE TURNOVER OF CITIZENS."

   IN THE LETTER, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LISTS FOUR
POINTS THAT IT BELIEVES COULD RESTORE PUBLIC ORDER IN COLOMBIA.

   THREE OF THE POINTS DEAL WITH NONEXTRADITION, AND THE FOURTH CALLS
FOR THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE, BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER THE POWERS
GRANTED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY ISSUED ON 18 AUGUST THAT PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION APPLIED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO COMBAT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ON THAT OCCASION, WHEN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS
ASSASSINATED, BARCO DECLARED AN "ALL-OUT WAR" ON THE DRUG MAFIAS,
REINSTATED EXTRADITION BY ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS WITHOUT PRIOR
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND ANNOUNCED THE CONFISCATION OF THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS' PROPERTY.  IN A DECLARATION ISSUED 6 DAYS LATER, THE
"EXTRADITABLES" ANNOUNCED A "COUNTEROFFENSIVE" AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT,
THE JUDGES, THE PRESS, AND THE "REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE" IN
REPRISAL FOR THE OFFICIAL ACTIONS.

   AT THE END OF THE LETTER ISSUED TODAY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS URGED
THE PUBLIC TO "REFLECT," AND ADDED: "WE ALL WANT TO END THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   "THE GOVERNMENT," THEY SAID, "WANTS TO END IT THROUGH ACTIONS OF
WAR, WHILE WE OFFER TO END IT THROUGH A DIALOGUE FOR PEACE."  THE
LETTER ENDS WITH THE QUESTION: "WHO IS RIGHT?"


DEV-MUC3-0603 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A DIALOGUE
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INCREASED IN COLOMBIA DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED THEY ARE WILLING TO END THE
WAR.

   THREE OF THE LEADERS MENTIONED IN THE EXTRADITABLES' LETTER THAT
CONTAINED A PROPOSAL TO TAKE PART IN A COMMISSION THAT WOULD
REPORTEDLY BEGIN MAKING CONTACTS FOR THE DIALOGUE TODAY ACCEPTED THE
MISSION AND SAID THAT THEY ARE READY TO COOPERATE IN THE COUNTRY'S
PEACE EFFORTS.

   THEY ARE MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ, FORMER LIBERAL
LEGISLATOR GUIDO PARRA, AND FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER JOAQUIN
VALLEJO.  MEANWHILE, CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO SAID THAT "THE MATTER MUST
BE STUDIED."

   THE EXTRADITABLES PROPOSED CREATING A NEGOTIATING COMMISSION IN A
LETTER SENT FROM CLANDESTINITY TO LIBERAL SENATOR LUIS GUILLERMO
GIRALDO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

   THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY SOME
POLITICAL GROUPS, DESPITE THE POSITION ASSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO HAS REPEATEDLY STATED HIS
OPPOSITION TO ANY STEP LEADING TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS
AND DRUG TERRORISTS.

   BARCO, THROUGH GOVERNMENT (INTERIOR) MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS, HAS
PUBLICLY SAID THAT A DIALOGUE WITH TERRORISM IS IMPOSSIBLE, AT LEAST
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

   IN VIEW OF THE SITUATION, SOME POLITICAL SECTORS HAVE SPECULATED ON
THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BARCO'S SUCCESSOR, WHO WILL BE
ELECTED IN FREE ELECTIONS IN MAY 1990. BARCO WILL LEAVE POWER ON 7
AUGUST 1990.

   THE MAFIA HAS PROMISED TO END THE WAVE OF TERRORISM UNLEASHED
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IF BARCO'S GOVERNMENT SUSPENDS THE EXTRADITION OF
DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THEY HAVE ALSO PROPOSED ACCEPTING THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT
OF JUSTICE, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE LEGALITY OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO
FACE THE MAFIAS, BUT DID NOT RECOMMEND EXTRADITION BY EXECUTIVE
DECREE.

   THE COURT RULED THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW PREVAILS OVER COLOMBIAN LAW,
AND NOTED THAT EXTRADITION THROUGH A STATE OF SIEGE DECREE IS NOT
COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT COLOMBIAN-U.S. TREATY.

   COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY IN 1979
WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL IN EFFECT, CANNOT BE APPLIED BECAUSE AT
THE END OF 1987 THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF INVALIDATED THE LAW THAT
ENFORCED IT.

   HOWEVER, SEVERAL COLOMBIAN JURISTS SAID TODAY THAT ONLY THE
COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE COURT'S
DECISION OR TO CONTINUE ACTING BY EXECUTIVE DECREE.

   IN THEIR PEACE PROPOSAL, THE EXTRADITABLES DEMANDED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT "GRANT COLOMBIANS THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFENSE,
ALLOWING THEM -- AS DEPORTED FOREIGNERS ARE ALLOWED -- TO EXHAUST ALL
LEGAL MEANS UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BEFORE RENOUNCING SOVEREIGNTY AND
TURNING THEM OVER BY EXTRADITION."

   VALLEJO, PARRA, AND GOMEZ MARTINEZ -- THE THREE MEMBERS PROPOSED BY
THE MAFIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTIATING COMMISSION -- SAID TODAY
THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY
AGREED THAT DIFFERENCES CAN ONLY BE EASED THROUGH DIALOGUE.

   "I AM WILLING TO TALK," SAID GOMEZ MARTINEZ, MAYOR OF MEDELLIN,
WHERE THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES.  OVER A YEAR AGO, GOMEZ MARTINEZ
WAS THE TARGET OF AN ATTACK BY THE THE EXTRADITABLES, WHO TRIED TO
KIDNAP HIM. "I AM WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S OKEY TO BEGIN THE
DIALOGUE," HE ADDED.

   VALLEJO, WHO DISCLOSED THAT IN MID-1988 HE PRESENTED TO BARCO'S
GOVERNMENT AN INITIAL DIALOGUE PROPOSAL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES, SAID
THAT "I AM WILLING TO TALK IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE."

   PARRA, A FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FRIEND OF PABLO ESCOBAR, THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL'S CHIEF, SAID THAT "I AM WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE
PEACE EFFORTS."

   OTHER SECTORS, PARTICULARLY POLITICAL GROUPS, AGREED THAT
NEGOTIATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO PUT AN END TO TERRORIST VIOLENCE IN
COLOMBIA.  


DEV-MUC3-0604 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BOGOTA, 24 OCT 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [REPORT]
[PILAR CALDERON] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY THAT IT WILL
CONTINUE TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS BECAUSE THERE IS
CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THAT COUNTRY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO DENIED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN A
DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING GROUPS AND
THEIR CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE POLICY
ALLOWS NO ROOM FOR TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, OR DIALOGUES.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ANY PROPOSAL TO MEDIATE WITH DRUG
TRAFFICKERS -- EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY ISSUED BY THE
EXTRADITABLES OR THEIR SPOKESMEN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE LEGISLATIVE DECREE 18-60 OF 1989, WHICH
ALLOWS FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  THIS DECREE
WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIES ITS DECISION BY RECALLING
THE MANY ACTS OF TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- 222 IN 2
MONTHS -- AND THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS.  THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE THEIR CRIMINAL POSITIONS
BY CLAIMING THAT THEY ADVOCATE PEACE.

   THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OR SUSPENSION OF COLOMBIAN
CITIZENS' EXTRADITION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY IN JURIDICAL
AND POLITICAL CIRCLES IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE UNITED STATES.
JOURNALISTS AND LAWYERS CAREFULLY READ THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S
RULING ON THE DECREE ALLOWING FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS.  EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE EXTRADITABLES SAID, IN A
LETTER ISSUED YESTERDAY, THAT THEY FULLY ABIDED BY THE COURT'S RULING.

   THE COURT RULED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE EXTRADITIONS VIA ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS ARE ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CASES WHERE THERE IS
ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY, THE EXTRADITION MUST BE CARRIED OUT
ACCORDING TO THE TREATY.  THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THE RULING IS QUITE
CLEAR.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE GOVERNMENT
MUST DECIDE IF THERE IS A TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES OR NOT BEFORE
IT ENFORCES THE EXTRADITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  [END
RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT'S RULING DOES NOT END THE EXTRADITIONS TO
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT BELIEVES THAT AN
EXTRADITION TREATY IS STILL IN EFFECT WITH THAT COUNTRY -- THE ONE
SIGNED IN 1888 -- AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED INSTEAD OF
 RESORTING TO EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS, THE
GOVERNMENT CLEARLY SAYS THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED
STATES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS] THE 1979 TREATY
HAD BEEN ANNULLED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, BUT ACCORDING TO
THE STATE COUNCIL, THAT TREATY REPLACED -- SO TO SPEAK -- THE 1933
TREATY SIGNED IN MONTEVIDEO AND THE 1888 TREATY.  THEREFORE, THINGS
ARE NOW THE SAME AS YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE.  [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, THE BODYGUARD OF EL ESPECTADOR'S CHIEF OF DISTRIBUTION
IN MEDELLIN, PEDRO LUIS OSORIO, WAS ASSASSINATED THIS AFTERNOON IN A
DOWNTOWN AREA OF ANTIOQUIA'S CAPITAL.

   CARTAGENA, 24 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPT] THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT A CARBOMB EXPLODED TONIGHT IN A RESIDENTIAL SECTOR IN THIS
COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA, SLIGHTLY INJURING ONLY TWO PEOPLE, BUT
CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THE BOMB SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE OF THE BOCAGRANDE TOURIST AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, A HOTEL,
A RESTAURANT, TWO MEDICAL CLINICS, AND A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

   ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED, THE
BOMB WAS PLACED BY TWO MEN IN A CAR, WHICH THEY HURRIEDLY ABANDONED 40
METERS FROM THE TELEPHONE OFFICE.

   THE AREA, WHICH WAS BLACKED OUT WHEN THE ELECTRIC LINES WERE
DESTROYED AND WAS LITTERED WITH GLASS, WAS CORDONED OFF BY POLICE, WHO
LAUNCHED A SEARCH THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR THE TERRORISTS.

   SERGEANT MARTINEZ OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THE BOMB HAD
CAUSED MUCH DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH HE ABSTAINED FROM GIVING AN ESTIMATE
UNTIL THE BUILDINGS ARE EXAMINED.

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBING, PRESS SECTORS
BLAMED IT ON THE DRUG MAFIA AGAINST WHOM THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED
WAR.

FORCES TO REINFORCE THE BORDER AREAS FOLLOWS REPORTS ON "THE
UNPRECEDENTED ENTRY OF FOREIGNERS WHO ARE PLUNDERING" THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING WOOD AND GOLD.

   MOREOVER, THE POLICE COMMANDER HAS STATED THAT TERRORISM "IS A
PERMANENT LATENT FACTOR" IN BOLIVIA.  AS AN EXAMPLE HE MENTIONED THE
INDIAN-MARXIST ORGANIZATION "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF
LIBERATION."

   THIS GROUP BEGAN ITS ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST 1988 WHEN IT ATTACKED THE
OFFICIAL MOTORCADE IN WHICH THE THEN-SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ
WAS TRAVELING.  NO INJURIES WHERE CAUSED BY THE ATTACK.

   ON 24 MAY THIS YEAR, THE SAME ORGANIZATION MURDERED TWO U.S. MORMON
MISSIONARIES ON A CROWDED STREET IN LA PAZ.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 27 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA ANNOUNCED TONIGHT IN THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL
THAT HE WILL SUSPEND THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE DECREED ON 21 MARCH
1988, AND WILL IMPROVE THE ORGANIZATION OF HIS COUNTRY'S DEFENSE
BECAUSE "WE CANNOT GO ON WITH OUR HANDS TIED."

   ORTEGA, ADDRESSING STUDENTS IN THE AUDITORIUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
COSTA RICA'S LAW SCHOOL, CONFIRMED THAT "WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OUT BUT
TO SUSPEND THE CEASE-FIRE" IN ORDER TO "HIT THE CONTRAS HARD," BECAUSE
-- HE ASSURED -- THEY HAVE FAILED TO RESPECT THE TRUCE ON NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS.

   "THE CEASE-FIRE EXTENSIONS ARE OVER," ORTEGA SAID, STRESSING THAT
"WE CANNOT GO ON WITH OUR HANDS TIED," AND HE PROMISED TO PROVIDE
FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THIS STATEMENT ON 28 OCTOBER AT A NEWS
CONFERENCE.

   "THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK," HE SAID, WAS AN ATTACK ON
21 OCTOBER WHEN THE CONTRAS MURDERED 19 PEASANTS WHO WERE ON THE WAY
TO REGISTER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   "WE MUST GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS," ORTEGA UNDERSCORED, POINTING OUT
THAT 2 DAYS AGO TWO ACTIVISTS FROM THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WERE ALSO MURDERED, WHICH CONSTITUTES "AN ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE ELECTORAL PROCESS."

   IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, HE ADDED, ON 22 OCTOBER "I MET WITH THE
ARMY COMMANDERS AND WE CONCLUDED THAT OUR HANDS WERE TIED" WITH THE
CEASE-FIRE DECREE.

   "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT REALLY WILLING TO DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS
AND THE CONTRAS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE CEASE-FIRE TO INCREASE THEIR
ACTIONS," HE ADDED, EMPHASIZING THAT "WE CANNOT MAINTAIN IT UNDER
THESE CONDITIONS."

   "WE MUST SEEK A WAY TO GUARANTEE THE LIFE OF THE NICARAGUANS, SO
THE CEASE-FIRE MUST END," HE STATED, ADDING THAT THE TOP-ECHELONS ALSO
DECIDED TO "ORGANIZE THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY EVEN BETTER."

   REFERRING TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, ORTEGA EMPHASIZED
THAT "WE MUST FULFILL OUR PLEDGES" CONCERNING THE CONTRAS'
DEMOBILIZATION, AND THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT ADVOCATES IT EVEN THOUGH
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT WILLING TO DO THAT.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT WORE A UNIFORM AND HAD A RED AND BLACK
HANDKERCHIEF TIED AROUND HIS NECK UPON HIS ARRIVAL AT THE UNIVERSITY,
LOCATED IN EASTERN SAN JOSE.  HE WAS CHEERED AND APPLAUDED BY AN
EUPHORIC AUDIENCE THAT HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM SINCE 1800.

   ORTEGA ALSO SPOKE ABOUT OTHER TOPICS DURING THE HOUR, MAINLY THOSE
DISCUSSED AT THE HEMISPHERIC SUMMIT HE IS ATTENDING ALONG WITH 15
HEADS OF STATE FROM THE CONTINENT -- INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT,
DISARMAMENT, AND DEVELOPMENT.

   "I HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING WITH THE DESIRE TO TALK TO ALL OF THE
HEADS OF STATE PARTICIPATING," HE NOTED, ADDING THAT "I AM PLEASED
WITH THE TALKS I HAVE HELD," ON THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, THE DEBT,
TRADE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING FIGHT, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
AND THE NEED TO A PROMOTE THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE.

   IN ADDITION, HE SAID THAT HE DISCUSSED THE COFFEE PROBLEM WITH
BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO,
AND THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IN VIEW OF THE NEED TO SEEK A COMMON
LATIN AMERICAN POSITION TO FIX THE COFFEE PRICE.

   REGARDING EL SALVADOR, THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT "NOT
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST COMPARISON CAN BE MADE BETWEEN THE CONTRAS AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)."

   "THE CONTRAS' CAMPS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY AND THE FMLN'S CAMPS
ARE IN EL SALVADOR, HE SAID, POINTING OUT THAT "THIS IS VERIFIABLE,"
AND "EL SALVADOR'S PROBLEM IS NOT NICARAGUA'S PROBLEM." [QUOTATION
MARKS AS RECEIVED]

   REGARDING PANAMA, ORTEGA SAID THAT WE DEFEND SELF-DETERMINATION AND
"ALL OF LATIN AMERICAN SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THE PANAMANIANS ARE
THE ONES WHO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS."

   AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS "CHAT" WITH THE STUDENTS, ORTEGA WENT
IMMEDIATELY TO THE NATIONAL THEATRE, IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE, WHERE THE
16 HEADS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT WERE SCHEDULED TO DINE TONIGHT,
DURING THE CONTINUATION OF THE EVENTS MARKING THE CENTENNIAL OF COSTA

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 OCT 89 (IZVESTIYA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH VLADIMIR
KOTOV, HEAD OF THE TASS DEPARTMENT IN PERU, BY OWN CORRESPONDENT
YEVGENIY BAY] [TEXT] ON THE MORNING OF 26 OCTOBER THE EDITORIAL OFFICE
RECEIVED TELEGRAMS FROM REUTERS AND AFP FROM THE PERUVIAN CAPITAL,
WHICH SAID THAT BOMBS HAD GONE OFF THE DAY BEFORE OUTSIDE THE SOVIET
AND PRC EMBASSIES IN LIMA.  OUR CORRESPONDENT YEVGENIY BAY CONTACTED
VLADIMIR KOTOV, HEAD OF THE TASS DEPARTMENT IN PERU, BY TELEPHONE AND
ASKED HIM FOR THE DETAILS.

   [KOTOV] ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS DROVE UP TO
THE SOVIET EMBASSY BUILDING AND PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A CAR BELONGING
TO ONE OF OUR DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL.  THEY HARDLY HAD TIME TO DRIVE OFF
BEFORE AN EXPLOSION RANG OUT.  ONE CAR WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND THREE
NEIGHBORING VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED.  THIS HAPPENED AT 2015 LOCAL TIME.
AND AT 2030 HOURS A VOLKSWAGEN PARKED NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRC
EMBASSY EXPLODED AFTER BEING PACKED WITH DYNAMITE.

   FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE NO CASUALTIES AND NO MEMBERS OF THE
DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ARE HURT.  THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT REALLY DAMAGED.

   [BAY] SO FAR, ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AGENCIES, NONE OF THE
TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS ACTION, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE SUSPECT THE EXTREME LEFT-WING
MAOIST ORGANIZATION, "SENDERO LUMINOSO."

   [KOTOV] JUDGING BY THE HALLMARK, IT COULD QUITE WELL BE.  AS IS
WELL KNOWN, "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ATTACKS ON
SOVIET MISSIONS AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE LAST 3 YEARS.  MANY REMEMBER
THE INCIDENT WHEN FOUR UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE TELEPHONED THE SOVIET
EMBASSY -- ALLEGEDLY TO DELIVER SOME SORT OF PACKAGE.  IN THE END, ONE
OF THE TERRORISTS GOT INTO THE EMBASSY GROUNDS AND, AT THAT MOMENT,
THE "PACKAGE" EXPLODED IN HIS HANDS.  AND SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
(IZVESTIYA REPORTED THIS) TERRORISTS PLANTED A BOMB UNDER A BUS IN
WHICH SOVIET FISHERMEN WERE TRAVELING.

   [BAY] AN EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE COUNTRY HAS
BEEN ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESCALATION IN TERRORIST ACTIONS.
HOW DOES THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY LOOK FROM WHERE YOU STAND?

   [KOTOV] THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS INTRODUCED HERE IN FEBRUARY 1986
AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED VIRTUALLY EVERY 30-60 DAYS SINCE THEN.  IT IS IN
EFFECT IN 35 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN LIMA
AND THE CAPITALS OF A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE WAVE OF
TERRORISM IS SHOWING NO SIGN OF ABATING -- EITHER ON THE PART OF THE
FAR RIGHT OR THE FAR LEFT.  IN OCTOBER ALONE, THEIR ACTIONS CLAIMED
200 LIVES.

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE POPULATION AND WRECK
THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR 12 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE PARTIALLY
ACHIEVED THEIR AIM.  TO THE UNINFORMED, PERUVIAN STATISTICS ARE SIMPLY
HORRIFYING: IN THE LAST 3 YEARS, 64 MAYORS OF VARIOUS SMALL AND
MEDIUM-SIZED TOWNS IN THE ANDES HAVE BEEN KILLED.  NATURALLY, THERE
ARE FEW BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RISK OF HOLDING THIS POST.

   [BAY] WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE SOVIET REPRESENTATIVES IN PERU
LIVING AND WORKING IN?

   [KOTOV] SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR FREEDOM OF
MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE ESCALATION OF TERRORISM NATURALLY AFFECTS OUR
WELLBEING.  PEOPLE LIVE IN A STATE OF TENSION.  YOU EXPECT SOMETHING
AWFUL TO HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT.  YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE MAXIMUM CAUTION
EVERYWHERE: BOTH AT HOME AND ON THE STREET.

CEASE-FIRE IN NICARAGUA, AS IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED BY NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA, WOULD BE "VERY UNFORTUNATE" AND "WOULD POSE
PROBLEMS FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN."

   DURING AN INTERVIEW GRANTED IN SAN JOSE TO CNN, A U.S. TELEVISION
NETWORK, CRISTIANI ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF
A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA.  REGARDING HIS TALKS WITH THE ARMED
OPPOSITION IN HIS COUNTRY HE SAID HE IS "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC."

   CRISTIANI SAID HE WOULD BE "DISAPPOINTED" IF THE NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT WERE TO SUSPEND THE UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE DECREED ON 21
MARCH 1988.  THIS WOULD PROVE, CRISTIANI SAID, THAT ORTEGA IS NOT
WILLING "TO RESPECT THE PROMISES MADE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PEACE PLAN" SIGNED IN 1987 BY COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR,
NICARAGUA, GUATEMALA, AND HONDURAS.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, ORTEGA HAS ALREADY BROKEN HIS COMMITMENT BY
CONTINUING TO SEND ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN), AS HONDURAS REVEALED THIS WEEK.

   CRISTIANI ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE" IF ORTEGA
UPHOLDS THE DECISION HE ANNOUNCED ON 27 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE WHERE HE
AND 15 OTHER CHIEFS OF STATE OF THE CONTINENT ATTENDED AN INTER -
AMERICAN SUMMIT.

   REGARDING PANAMA, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE OAS
COUNTRIES WILL "CONTINUE MAKING EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY DIPLOMATIC
EFFORTS, TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY" IN THAT COUNTRY "IN THE NEAR FUTURE."
HE DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA.
"NO ONE HERE (IN SAN JOSE, WHERE MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN OPPOSITION
WERE ALSO PRESENT) IS IN FAVOR OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA."

   CRISTIANI STATED HIS SUPPORT FOR U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WITH
REGARD TO THE RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN PANAMA.  CRISTIANI SAID THAT BUSH
"DID WHAT HE HAD TO" WHEN HE REJECTED A MILITARY INTERVENTION ON THE
SIDE OF THE COUPISTS.  REGARDING THE PEACE TALKS HIS GOVERNMENT IS
HOLDING WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
CRISTIANI DECLARED HIMSELF "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC" AND NOTED THAT
CONTRARY TO THE TALKS HELD BETWEEN THE FMLN AND FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE, THE CURRENT MEETINGS ARE NOT "ISOLATED EVENTS."  NOW,
HE SAID, "THE PROCESS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT."  THIS PROCESS, HE
ADDED, IS THE "RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO
BY THE TWO SIDES."

   REGARDING CHARGES BY A SALVADORAN SOLDIER, CESAR VIELMAN JOYA
MARTINEZ, WHO SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN ASSASSINATIONS
COMMITTED BY A DEATH SQUAD ON ORDERS, ACCORDING TO HIM, FROM THE
SALVADORAN HIGH MILITARY COMMAND AND WHO ALSO NOTED THAT U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS HAD TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, CRISTIANI SAID THAT
THESE CHARGES ARE PART OF "FMLN EFFORTS" TO DISCREDIT HIS GOVERNMENT.

   MARTINEZ WILL BE "SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR HAVING DONE WHAT HE HAS
SAID HE HAS DONE," CRISTIANI SAID.  THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
 ADMITTED THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT STILL OCCURS BUT NOTED THAT THE
SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES PUNISH CRIME.

   CRISTIANI CONCLUDED BY STATING: "MARTINEZ IS A DESERTER AND A
WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST HAS BEEN ISSUED."

   JOYA MARTINEZ, WHO FLED HIS COUNTRY IN JULY AND SOUGHT POLITICAL
ASYLUM IN THE UNITED STATES, MADE HIS STATEMENTS TO A GROUP OF
JOURNALISTS IN WASHINGTON.

   BOGOTA, 28 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] "THE EXTRADITABLES" CLANDESTINE
GROUP TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAST NIGHT'S DYNAMITE ATTACK
AGAINST A POLICE AIR BASE AT GUAIMARAL, 25 KM TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA,
KILLING A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER.

   THROUGH ANONYMOUS PHONE CALLS TO VARIOUS MEDIA IN THE NORTHEAST OF
MEDELLIN, ANTIOQUIA PROVINCE, THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PLACING A BOMB INSIDE ONE OF THE SMALL AIRPORT'S BATHROOMS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ARE COMPRISED OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING CAPOS, WHO, THROUGH VIOLENT ACTS, ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ON ITS DECISION TO EXTRADITE THEM TO THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE ATTACK AND DENIED
NEWSMEN ACCESS TO THE TERMINAL.  THE AIRPORT HOUSES AIRCRAFT USED BY
ANTINARCOTICS POLICE.

   LIMA, 28 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] PERUVIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER EMILIO
REYNOSO AGUILAR, ALIAS "RETACO I," ARRIVED IN LIMA TODAY UNDER STRICT
POLICE SECURITY.  REYNOSO WAS EXTRADITED FROM COLOMBIA TO BE TRIED
HERE ON CHARGES OF MURDER, KIDNAPPING, DRUG TRAFFICKING, ROBBERY, AND
OTHER CRIMES.

   "RETACO I" IS LINKED TO COLOMBIA'S MEDELLIN CARTEL.  HE WAS HANDED
OVER TO PERUVIAN POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAD TRAVELED TO COLOMBIA TO BRING
HIM TO LIMA, WHERE HE IS UNDER INDICTMENT BY NINE DIFFERENT COURTS.

   REYNOSO IS KNOWN IN LIMA AS "THE ESCAPE KING" BECAUSE HE HAS
ESCAPED FROM PERUVIAN JAILS A NUMBER OF TIMES DISGUISED AS A WOMAN OR
A POLICE OFFICER.  REYNOSO ESCAPED FROM THE JUSTICE PALACE AFTER
TAKING THE POLICE OFFICER GUARDING HIM HOSTAGE.

   "RETACO I'S" BROTHERS HAVE SIMILAR ALIASES; THEY ARE CALLED RETACO
II, III, AND IV.  ALL OF THEM HAVE ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS,
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS CURRENTLY IN JAIL.

   "RETACO I" LEFT PERU ON 1984 TO CONTINUE HIS CRIMINAL CAREER IN
OTHER COUNTRIES.  HE FINALLY ENDED UP IN COLOMBIA, WHERE HE WORKED
WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNTIL HIS ARREST.  REYNOSO IS CONSIDERED VERY
DANGEROUS.  THE PROBLEM FOR THE PERUVIAN POLICE WILL NOW BE TO KEEP
"THE ESCAPE KING" IN JAIL.

THE ATTACK, IN WHICH FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, ON THE

THEY WILL CONTINUE HARASSING THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY FORCES.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE DELIVERED TO THE PRESS IN THE CITY OF SAN

DOMINGO CAVALLO TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT HAS
ASKED THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT TO "INTERCEDE WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND WITH ANYONE ELSE THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCE OVER
THE CONTRAS" TO MAKE THEM DISBAND.

WHICH 18 PEASANTS WERE KILLED RECENTLY."  HE ADDED THAT "UNFORTUNATELY
THE RESURGENCE OF HOSTILITIES COULD JEOPARDIZE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS"
THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION.

   ON 28 OCTOBER MENEM HAD EXPRESSED HIS DISAGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA'S
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE. THIS DECISION HAD
PROMPTED AN INCIDENT INVOLVING U.S. PRESIDENT GEROGE BUSH, WHO ACCUSED
THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT OF BEHAVING "LIKE A WILD ANIMAL AT A PARTY."

   DURING HIS MEETING WITH MENEM, THE NICARAGUAN LEADER JUSTIFIED THE
DECISION BY LISTING THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT THE CONTRAS HAVE CARRIED
OUT AND EXPLAINED THAT FOR THE CEASEFIRE TO BE REINSTATED "THE CONTRAS
MUST DISBAND IN KEEPING WITH THE DECISION REACHED BY THE LATIN

FOLLOWING:

   1. WE BLAME THIS COWARDLY CRIME ON THE GENERAL STAFF AND COLONEL

ARE ADDED TO THE GROWING LIST OF CRIMES THAT THESE SINISTER FORCES

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 1 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS
CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, REGARDING POINT NO. 6 IN WHICH YOU
SPOKE ABOUT SPECIFIC RESULTS CONCERNING THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
CONTRAS, TO WHAT SPECIFIC AMOUNTS IS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
REFERRING TO?  ARE YOU SAYING THAT 20 PERCENT, 10 PERCENT OR 50
PERCENT OF THE CONTRAS HAVE TO BE DEMOBILIZED IN ORDER FOR THE
CEASE-FIRE TO BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN?

   [ORTEGA] THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN.
THEN, THE NUMBER OF CONTRAS THAT ARE DEMOBILIZED WOULD BE ESTABLISHED
ACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS MADE AT THE UNITED NATIONS.  THAT IS, HOW
MANY CONTRAS CAN BE DEMOBILIZED RIGHT AWAY, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BE
RETURNING TO NICARAGUA, HOW MANY WILL GO TO THIRD COUNTRIES.
THEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THE PLAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL BE
WILLING TO REINSTATE THE CEASE-FIRE.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE U.S. CONGRESS
DISCUSSED GIVING MORE AID TO THE CONTRAS.  NO ONE EVEN WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THE CONTRAS, IT WAS A STALE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME A
BURNING ISSUE OVERNIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT AID FOR THE
CONTRAS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO THEM.  LAST
NIGHT, THE U.S. SENATE ISSUED A RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDENMING THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.  MY QUESTIONS ARE: FIRST, WHY HAS THERE BEEN
SUCH A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE.  SECOND, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO
THE U.S. CONGRESS.

   [ORTEGA] U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR
REELECTION.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT SOME OF THEM DESERVE, U.S.
CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION.  I HAVE TALKED TO
MANY OF THEM HERE AND THEY ARE CYNICAL.  THEY TELL ME: I DISAGREE WITH
THAT BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ELECTED ME.  IF THOSE WHO
ELECTED ME HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION, THEN I HAVE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT
FOR THEIR VIEWPOINTS AND FORGET ABOUT MY OWN OPINION.  LET US NOT
MISLEAD OURSELVES.  YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW U.S. CONGRESSMEN ACT.
THEREFORE, IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE
CONTRAS AS THEY HAD DONE -- BECAUSE THE CONGRESS HAD APPROVED THE
SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND LET
THE WAR CONTINUE, AND LEAVE THE BURDEN ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO
ARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WAR.  THEREFORE, WE HAVE BEEN
REPORTING THE KILLINGS, THE ASSASSINATIONS, THE CRIMES, THE CONTRAS
ATTACKS, AND THE YANKEE CONGRESS HAS REMAINED SILENT.

   THEREFORE, WE SEE AN EASY-GOING ATTITUDE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE
THE U.S. CONGRESS REACTS IMMEDIATELY.  THEY REACT BECAUSE THEY ARE
FULLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE MEDDLING IN NICARAGUAN POLITICS.  THEY WILL
HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE, AND THEY DO NOT
WANT TO DISCUSS THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AGAIN.  IT WAS EASY TO SET ASIDE
THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS SO
THE CONTRAS COULD CONTINUE KILLING NICARAGUANS WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE
REMAINS CALM -- LET THE PEACE PLAN CONTINUE AS FAR AS IT CAN AND AS
FAR AS PRESIDENT BUSH ALLOWS IT TO DEVELOP.  THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN CAN
THEN FORGET ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND WORK ON OTHER DOMESTIC OR
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES IN WHICH THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED.

   HOWEVER, WHEN NICARAGUA SAYS: WE WILL NOT EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE,
THEN THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY.  WHY DO THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY?  BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE.
MOREOVER, THERE MIGHT BE A FEVERISH CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL PROPOSE
GIVING MILITARY AID TO THE CONTRAS.  WELL, LET THEM DISCUSS MILITARY
AID.  DO THEY WANT TO DISCUSS MILITARY AID, WELL THAT IS THEIR
PROBLEM.  WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE YANKEE CONGRESS ACTIONS
WILL EASE OR HINDER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF
ELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND NOW ON THE YANKEE CONGRESS AND ON
THE YANKEE PRESIDENT.  IT WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO
DO IT.  HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTIONS ARE HELD ON 25 FEBRUARY
WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  [CONTINUED]

RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INTERNAL ORDER IN LIMA OVER TO THE ARMED
FORCES, 2 DAYS BEFORE AN "ARMED STRIKE" DECLARED BY THE MAOIST SHINING
PATH TERRORIST GROUP GOES INTO EFFECT.

   ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL REPORT, THE MILITARIZATION OF LIMA WAS
DECLARED AT THE SAME TIME A GROUP OF 100 HOODED SHINING PATH ACTIVITS
STAGED A DEMONSTRATION, ENGAGED IN A SHOOT-OUT, AND HURLED EXPLOSIVES
AT THE POLICE IN LA VICTORIA DISTRICT.

   INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MATILLA REPORTED THAT 2 PEOPLE DIED AND
15 OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN THE THE CLASH, WHICH PLACE WHILE A RELIGIOUS
GROUP WAS CARRYING OUT A PEACEFUL MARCH.

   ACCORDING TO A DECREE, THE ARMED FORCES WILL TAKE CONTROL OF LIMA
DEPARTMENT AND EL CALLAO PROVINCE, NEXT TO THE CAPITAL, WHERE A STATE
OF EMERGENCY IS IN FORCE.

   ON 23 OCTOBER, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT EXTENDED FOR 1 MONTH THE
STATE OF EMERGENCY IN LIMA DUE TO AN OUTBURST OF THE POLITICAL
VIOLENCE THAT HAS RESULTED IN MORE THAN 350 DEATHS NATIONWIDE LAST
MONTH.

   DESPITE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH SUSPENDS IMPORTANT
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, UNTIL TODAY INTERNAL ORDER WAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE.

   PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY TOLD THE MEDIA THAT THE POLICE ARRESTED
149 PEOPLE, OF WHOM ABOUT 100 ARE ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS, DURING
TODAY'S RIOTS.

   THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE SAID THAT THE RIOTS WERE MEANT "TO
HINDER" THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER.  HE ADDED
THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXERT "ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY TO COMBAT
SUBVERSION."

   THE SHINING PATH MEMBERS TODAY DEMONSTRATED WITH SHOUTS FAVORING
THE "ARMED STRUGGLE," AND THEY HANDED OUT LEAFLETS CALLING ON THE
PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN AN "ARMED STRIKE" ON 3 NOVEMBER.

   THE SHINING PATH, WHICH HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN WARFARE FOR THE PAST
10 YEARS, INTENDS TO PARALYZE LIMA WITH THE "ARMED STRIKE" -- A
GENERAL STRIKE UNDER ARMED COERCION -- ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

   THE "SHINING PATH" HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED IT INTENDS TO BOYCOTT THE
ELECTIONS [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] LEADER OF THE ORGANIZATION, ABIMAEL
GUZMAN.

   THE MAIN PERUVIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND LABOR AND
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CALLED, FOR THE SAME DAY, A
DEMONSTRATION IN FAVOR OF PEACE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS
CONSIDERED TO BE THREATENED BY TERRORISM.

   THE "SHINING PATH" HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ARMED ACTIVITIES NATIONWIDE
DUE TO THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  AS A RESULT, HUNDREDS OF
CANDIDATES HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE RACE.

   IN ITS PROCLAMATIONS, THE "SHINING PATH" THREATENED "TO ANNIHILATE,
SOONER OF LATER" ALL CANDIDATES WHO RUN IN THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

VILLARREAL] [TEXT] FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, THE BLOODBATH CONTINUES
TO ROCK THIS CAPITAL CITY AND THE END TO THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS
ALARMING THE PEOPLE, DOES NOT SEEM TO BE NEAR.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS,
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] URBAN COMMANDS
FAILED ONCE AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LOCATED IN LAICO NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE FMLN
URBAN COMMANDS FIRED TWO RPG-2 ROCKET LAUNCHERS WHICH HIT A PRIVATE
VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATE 72246 THAT WAS PASSING THE MILITARY
GARRISON.  AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL ATTACK, AN AGRONOMIST, IDENTIFIED
AS 57- YEAR- OLD JOSE HERMOGENES MARTINEZ, WAS KILLED.  WE DID NOT
TAKE PICTURES OF HIS BODY BECAUSE IT WAS TOTALLY MUTILATED AS A RESULT
OF THE STRONG EXPLOSION.  ALSO INJURED WAS A STREET VENDOR IDENTIFIED
AS MARIA DEL CARMEN PEREZ.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THERE WERE FOUR MEN IN A
PICKUP, TWO SEATED IN FRONT AND TWO IN THE BACK.  THE TWO WHO WERE IN
THE BACK TOOK OUT THE BAZOOKAS AND FIRED ON THE GARRISON'S GATE.  A
MAN DRIVING A SUZUKI DROVE AT THE SAME TIME THE ROCKETS WERE LAUNCHED
AND HE WAS HIT.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] FOUR.  THE CAR WHERE THE INJURED MAN WAS?
ONLY ONE PERSON, THE MAN WHO WAS INJURED.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE VEHICLE FROM WHERE THE
ROCKETS WHERE FIRED?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] FOUR PERSONS.

   [REPORTER] AT WHAT TIME DID THAT HAPPEN?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO, AT APPROXIMATELY 1530.

   [REPORTER] HOW MANY ROCKETS WERE FIRED?

   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] TWO.

   [SECOND UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THE MAN WAS IN THE CAR.  AFTER THE
DEVICES EXPLODED -- WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT KIND WERE FIRED -- THERE WAS
SMOKE AND GUNPOWDER ALL OVER THE PLACE.  HIS CLOTHES AND BODY WERE
TOTALLY DESTROYED.  WHEN WE TOOK HIM TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL WE TALKED
TO A DOCTOR, AND HE SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ALL THEY COULD TO
SAVE HIS LIFE.  [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE
MILITARY GARRISON, REGRETTED THE ATTACK AND SAID THAT THESE ATTACKS
ARE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VIOLENCE UNLEASHED IN THE PAST FEW
DAYS BY GROUPS THAT ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [FUENTES] YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE VEHICLE.  WE
BELIEVE THE ROCKETS WERE AIMED AT THE GATE, AT THE GUARDS STANDING AT
THE ENTRANCE OF THE HEADQUARTERS.  PERHAPS THEY WERE AIMED AT ME
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN IN THE AREA 5 MINUTES EARLIER.

   THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR MINDS.  THEY DO NOT CARE
IF THE KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.  THESE COULD BE GROUPS THAT THE FMLN
CAN NO LONGER CONTROL OR PERHAPS THEY ARE ONLY KILLERS WHO ONLY KNOW
HOW TO MURDER PEOPLE.  [END RECORDING]

   THE INJURED PERSONS WERE TAKEN TO ROSALES HOSPITAL IN SAN SALVADOR
WHERE THEY WERE GIVEN EMERGENCY TREATMENT.  THE STREET VENDOR SAYS
THAT IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT SHE WAS NOT KILLED.

NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TODAY CONDEMNED THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
[FENASTRAS].

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENCY ACCUSES THE DEATH SQUADS OF
PERPETRATING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK IN WHICH A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED
AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS KILLING NINE PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE
WELL-KNOWN UNION LEADER ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ.

   THIS TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS, WHICH REVIVES RECENT
HISTORY IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PROVES THE CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE
ULTRARIGHT-WING FORCES SERVING IMPERIALIST INTERESTS, AND REVEALS
THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS, DESPITE THEIR HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT
DESIRING PEACE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY, THE DOCUMENT STATES.

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THIS AND OTHER CRIMES OBLIGE THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO FIND
AND PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE GUILTY.

   SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] SAID THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT IN RESPONSE TO THE 30
OCTOBER GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUERRILLAS'
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT THEY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CAUSED GREAT SURPRISE AMONG VARIOUS CIRCLES
IN THE COUNTRY THAT VOWED TO MAKE NEW EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH THEM.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS
DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PROTEST
A DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LABOR UNION ON 31 OCTOBER
THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 INJURED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS).

   THE FMLN, IN A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE LEADERS, STATED
THAT "WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE TO BE USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MASSACRE."

   IT ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE OAS, UNITED NATIONS, AND THE CHURCH OFFER
GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR'S OPPOSITION GROUPS.

   REVEREND EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR
THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE (CPDN), WHICH IS MADE UP OF OVER 60 SOCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE REGRET THIS KIND OF DECISION
VERY MUCH, BUT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS TO TRY TO
RESUME THE DIALOGUE."

   PALACIOS ADDED THAT "IF THE DOOR OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION IS
CLOSED, THE DOOR OF WAR WILL OPEN."

   EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE
MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, SAID THAT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS "MUST CONTINUE."

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) MUST INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME
COMMITTED AGAINST FENASTRAS; HOWEVER, THE DIALOGUE MUST NOT BE
SUSPENDED," COLINDRES ADDED.

   JUAN JOSE MARTEL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC), WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE,
EXPRESSED SURPRISE OVER THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION.

   MARTEL SAID THAT RIGHT-WING SALVADORAN GROUPS ARE TRYING TO
ELIMINATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH SEEKS TO END THE WAR THROUGH
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL MEANS.

   SO FAR, NO GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS REACTED TO THE FMLN'S DECISION
TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED ON 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   PALACIOS, ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND LABOR LEADERS,
HEADED A MARCH TO ACCOMPANY THE BODIES OF 10 WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED
DURING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN
SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM A NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON.

   THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING THAT OF FENASTRAS LEADER FEBE
ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO
SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS.

   TENSION WAS HIGH DURING THE MARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY
MILITARY PRESENCE IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE THE
UNION MEMBERS DETAINED AT LEAST 30 PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN WHO,
ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION.

   THE MARCH ENDED AT THE GENERAL CEMETERY WHERE THE BODIES OF THE
UNION MEMBERS WERE BURIED.

PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
ARE WORKING HARD SO THAT THE BREAK IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GUERILLAS
AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ONLY TEMPORARY.

   ARIAS TODAY IN SAN JOSE ANNOUNCED THAT ON 6 NOVEMBER HE WILL MEET
IN SAN JOSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SALVADORAN REBELS, ADDING THAT
HE HAD TALKED WITH PRESIDENT PEREZ REGARDING THE NEED TO "CALL ON THE
PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT, WHO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE TIME AND PLACE
OF HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS,, SAID THAT HIS GOAL IS TO "URGE THEM
TO PROMISE THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL ONLY BE
TEMPORARY."

   ARIAS, 1987 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FOR HIS PEACEMAKING EFFORTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST
TIME FOR THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TO BE RESUMED."

   IN THE PAST 8 DAYS IN EL SALVADOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS
ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, DURING WHICH
10 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND MANY INJURED.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT -- THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS HELD IN MEXICO CITY IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND ROUND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, IN OCTOBER --
FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN
SALVADOR THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   "I VIEW THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH GREAT SADDNESS AND
REGRET; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONLY A STUMBLING BLOCK IN A
PEACE PROCESS THAT IS NOT A VERY EASY ONE," THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
SAID.

   PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS VENEZUELAN COLLEAGUE --
WHO WAS TO HAVE HOSTED THE NEXT ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN -- TO JOIN IN HIS EFFORTS TO URGE THE PARTIES
INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK "WHEN THE SITUATION
IMPROVES."

   "ON THE PATH FOR PEACE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN STEPS BACKWARDS ARE
TAKEN -- LIKE THE ONE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN IN EL SALVADOR AND
PREVIOUSLY IN NICARAGUA," PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE
DECISION MADE BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT NOT
TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE CONTRAS.

CARACAS, VENEZUELA, DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT'S (FMLN) DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE.

   CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK THAT KILLED 10 TRADE UNION MEMBERS ON 31
OCTOBER, WHICH THE FMLN HAS BLAMED ON ARMY AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS.  ON
THAT DATE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEGAN ON
17 OCTOBER IN COSTA RICA.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT REJECTED "THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND
MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE FMLN THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC."

   AFTER SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASKED THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH "FOR
GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA AND VENEZUELA, OSCAR ARIAS AND CARLOS

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO SAYS THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HURTING THEMSELVES BY
CARRYING OUT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE PERPETRATED RECENTLY.  HE SAID
THE REBELS ARE ACTING LIKE OSTRICHES BY HIDING THEIR HEADS UNDER THE
SAND.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] LOGICALLY THAT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY MUST
REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM.  THE PEOPLE CONDEMN ALL OF
THESE ACTIONS.  THE LATEST ATTACKS ARE HURTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ITSELF.  THEY HAVE BEEN ISOLATED
INTERNATIONALLY, THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM, AND THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE ARMY ARE FULFULLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE.  THEREFORE, THEY
MUST CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEM SERIOUSLY BY
REACHING AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BRING PEACE TO ALL. THE TERRORIST
AGGRESSION MAKES NO SENSE.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION?  WILL IT CONTINUE
WITH THE TALKS?  WILL IT GO TO THE TALKS EVEN IF THE GUERRILLA
COMMANDERS DO NOT ATTEND?

   [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY HAS A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE.
IT IS A COMMITMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE.  BESIDES OUR WILLINGNESS
TO ACHIEVE PEACE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THESE TALKS.  WE WILL
CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ROAD BUT WE MUST
CONTINUE ON IT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE SAN JOSE MEETING LIKE THE ONE IN
CARACAS, AND MAYBE OTHERS AFTER THAT, HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THE GUERRILLAS WILL
LOGICALLY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE
TABLE.

   [REPORTER] THEY ASK FOR GUARANTEES FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

   [MERINO] I BELIEVE WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE GUARANTEES THAN THE
ONES WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THEM.  THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING THAT
THESE PEOPLE ONLY UNDERSTAND STRONG ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS REVIEWED THE SITUATION QUITE WELL, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL
INTO THAT TRAP OR MAKE THAT MISTAKE.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LOGICALLY BE
PRUDENT.  [END RECORDING]

   VICE PRESIDENT MERINO SAID THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS WITHDREW FROM THE TALKS AND DEMANDED SECURITY FOR LABOR
UNION ORGANIZATIONS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], IN WHICH 10 LABOR
UNION MEMBERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING OPPOSITION LEADER ELIZABETH
VELAZQUEZ.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [EL
SALVADOR GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] CONCERNING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  ON THE DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE GOVERNMENT
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO CARRY OUT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT FENASTRAS
LEADERS HAVE BEEN HINDERING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD CLEAR UP THE
ATTACK.

   NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO CARRY
OUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, AND WILL EVEN BRING TO THE COUNTRY SOME
EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO THAT WITH THE HELP OF MODERN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY THEY WILL HELP THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE CLARIFY THIS
BLOODY AND CRIMINAL ATTACK AND ESTABLISH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

   LIKEWISE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSION THAT
WILL GUARANTEE THE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IT WILL INVITE THE FOLLOWING:
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE OAS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SALVADORAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE;
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES; TWO LABOR UNION
REPRESENTATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING FROM FENASTRAS; DR IGNACIO
ELLACURIA [JESUIT PRIEST AND RECTOR OF THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY]; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC; AND THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE.

   2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS SUPPLIED EVIDENCE FROM THE
BEGINNING THAT IT IS SINCERELY SEEKING PEACE.  THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION
ATTENDED A FIRST MEETING WITH THE FMLN IN MEXICO, AND ACCEPTED A
COMMITMENT, AS FOLLOWS, AND I QUOTE: BOTH PARTIES COMMIT THEMSELVES
NOT TO WITHDRAW UNILATERALLY FROM THE DIALOGUE.

   THE FMLN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF
THE MEXICO AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO [WORD INDISTINCT] THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE'S HOPES FOR PEACE.  FAR FROM SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE FMLN
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN
EVER IN ORDER TO HALT THE BLOODSHED.

   3.  EVIDENTLY, IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ONE, THE ENEMIES OF PEACE
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE DIALOGUE FAIL.  THE RECENT TERRORIST ACTIONS
ARE AN INSULT TO THE CIVILIZED MECHANISMS THAT HAVE COME UP AT THE
NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO
DO ITS WORK, AND IT WILL NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE TALKS IN SPITE OF THE
SORROWFUL EVENTS THAT HAVE BROUGHT MORE MOURNING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

   4.  IN THESE DIFFICULT MOMENTS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING,
THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS CALL FOR THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM, SO
THAT IN A PRUDENT AND UNDERSTANDING MANNER WE WILL JOIN EFFORTS TO
HELP REACH PEACE AND NOT PROMOTE VIOLENCE, WHICH ONLY SERVES TO
 HINDER THE DIALOGUE.

NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE
FOR THEMSELVES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE
THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL
PARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE
INITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A
WHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO.

   IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF
EL SALVADOR.  THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED
AND 31 WERE INJURED.  THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT.  THIS IS PART
OF THE PROCESS.  WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL
DISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES.
WHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  WE ARE NOT
TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

   IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY,
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET
IN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES.  ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN
JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN
GOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION.

   WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE
THE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES.  WHAT WE
HAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING
PROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS
ESTABLISH.

   [REPORTER] THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER?

   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S
 IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED
AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT
CRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED?

   [GONZALEZ] ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR
CHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN
THE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY.  SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN
INVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE
GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM
PART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART
IN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS.  WHAT THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE
ACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED
IN THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
IS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE
DOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY
FUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, IN
ANALYZING RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR, HAS REPORTED THAT
GROUPS OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT [FMLN -FDR] ALLIANCE COULD BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

   THE MILITARY COMMANDER WAS CAREFUL IN MAKING HIS STATEMENT.  HE
SAID THAT HE HAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THOSE GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
EXPLOSIONS IN THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION
[FENASTRAS] AND COMADRES [COMMITTEE OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES OF THE
PAST, THE ARMY HAS BEEN BLAMED, AND LATER IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT
FMLN TERRORISTS HAD CARRIED THEM OUT.

   ELENA FUENTES RECALLED THAT A FEW DAYS AGO THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION
ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND HE WENT THERE AND IT WAS
ESTABLISHED IN FRONT OF STUDENT LEADERS THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED
BY A GRENADE THAT WENT OFF IN THE HANDS OF A YOUNG LEFTIST WHO WAS
HANDLING IT.  BY THEN, HOWEVER, STATEMENTS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE
ACCUSING THE MILITARY.

   ELENA FUENTES ALSO REFERRED TO INTERNAL PURGES WITHIN COMMUNIST
GROUPS, PURGES LIKE THE CASE OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, ALIAS COMMANDER
MARIA; SALVADOR CAYETANO CARPIO, ALIAS MARCIAL; AND OTHERS.

   HE SAID: "IT WOULD NOT BE STRANGE TO FIND THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE
BEEN THE RESULT OF A PURGE OR A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC BY THE COMMUNISTS
TO ATTRACT POLITICAL ATTENTION AND GAIN THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT, WHICH
EVERYBODY BELIEVES THEY ARE LOSING."

   IT WAS RECALLED, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THAT THE NAME OF ONE OF THE
VICTIMS OF THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WAS
MENTIONED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING CARRIED OUT BY INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE EMBEZZLEMENT OF AID FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
THAT WAS TO BENEFIT THE MOST NEEDY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT THAT
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF TERRORIST GROUPS TO BE USED FOR TERRORIST
PURPOSES.

   ELENA FUENTES STATED: "TIME AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL TELL WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED."

   HE SAID THAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE ON
THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, FOR WHICH THE FMLN - FDR CLAIMED CREDIT, AS WELL
AS THE ATTACKS ON COMADRES AND FENASTRAS, WAS TO GIVE THE FMLN - FDR
LEADERSHIP JUSTIFICATION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DIALOGUE.

   ELENA FUENTES SAID THAT THE TERRORIST GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID IN
MANAGUA YESTERDAY THAT THE LEFTIST LEADERSHIP IS CONSIDERING NOT GOING
TO THE DIALOGUE MEETINGS BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THIS
CAPITAL THAT A DELEGATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) WILL MEET THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON WITH UN AND OAS
REPRESENTATIVES TO ANALYZE THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION AND THE FUTURE OF
THE TALKS BETWEEN THE REBELS AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION.

   COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, ONE OF THE FIVE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND
MEMBERS, ISSUED A STATEMENT THROUGH RADIO VENCEREMOS -- THE OFFICIAL
VOICE OF THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS -- AND SAID THAT THE MEETINGS
WILL START TOMORROW 6 NOVEMBER.

   OTHER FMLN DELEGATES WILL MEET TOMORROW WITH COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS, WHO HAS STATED HIS CONCERN REGARDING THE TALKS BETWEEN
THE REBELS AND CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AFTER RIGHT-WING SQUADS
ASSASSINATED 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ SAID "THAT THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION'S
DOUBLE-FACED CONDUCT IS PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT."

   "THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION AND THE ARMY OPPOSE REAL
NEGOTIATIONS, AND THEIR CONCEPT OF A DIALOGUE IS TO TALK AND TALK --
BUT ONLY TO GAIN TIME AND PROJECT A GOOD IMAGE AT THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL," THE REBEL LEADER SAID.

   REFERRING TO THIS, GONZALEZ ASSERTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION
TO SEND ITS DELEGATION TO THE 20-21 NOVEMBER MEETING IN CARACAS,
WHETHER THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES ATTEND IT OR NOT, IS AIMED AT
"CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE MASSACRES PERPETRATED THIS WEEK
AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."

   COMMANDER GONZALEZ ALSO REFERRED TO CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A
COMMISSION WILL BE CREATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF UN AND OAS
DELEGATES TO INVESTIGATE THE 10 LABOR LEADERS' MASSACRE.

   "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION WITH A CORRUPT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR ," GONZALEZ SAID.  HE
RECALLED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THE MURDER
OF SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IN 10 YEARS.  THE
GUERRILLA BLAMES MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT
PARTY'S IDEOLOGISTS, FOR ROMERO'S MURDER.

   THE FMLN COMMANDER ALSO WARNED THAT THE ARMY "HAS LAUNCHED A
CAMPAIGN TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND WORLD OPINION BY ACCUSING THE
GUERRILLAS OF PERPETRATING TERRORIST ACTIONS."

   THE ARMED FORCES ACTUALLY WANT "TO COVER UP THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHIFTED FROM SELECTIVE ARRESTS TO MASS ARRESTS --
AND FROM GENOCIDE TO INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS," HE ADDED.

   THE GUERRILLA COMMANDER ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE GUERRILLA FORCES
WILL MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF MILITARY ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING A REAL DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION PROCESS WHICH LEADS THE COUNTRY TO AN EVERLASTING PEACE.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 5 OCT 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MARINA PETROVSKAYA] [TEXT] THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS
APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE AN ANTI-NICARAGUAN RESOLUTION WHICH GRANTS
$4 MILLION WORTH OF SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS.
ANALYST MARINA PETROVSKAYA DISCUSSES THE SUBJECT.

   THIS RESOLUTION IN ESSENCE ALLOWS THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIRTY WAR
AGAINST NICARAGUA.  THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE LATELY INCREASED THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF NICARAGUA BY KILLING CIVILIANS
AND SANDINIST SOLDIERS.  AS WITNESSED BY THE [WORD INDISTINCT], THIS
HAS NOT HAPPENED BY CHANCE.  MANY CONTRAS TURNED THEMSELVES INTO THE
NICARAGUAN AUTHORITIES WHEN AND AMNESTY WAS DECLARED.  THEY ADMITTED
THAT THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR LEADERS IN HONDURAS TO CROSS THE
BORDER AND, BY MEANS OF TERROR AND THREAT, FORCED CIVILIANS TO VOTE
FOR THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATES.

   SUPRISINGLY, THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE NOT AIMED AT MORE AMBITIOUS
GOALS.  INSTEAD OF BEING CONDEMNED BY WASHINGTON THEY ARE RECEIVING
COMPLEMENTARY AID FROM IT.  CURIOUSLY, THIS NEW [WORD INDISTINCT] FOR
THE CONTRAS COINCIDES WITH THE GRANTING OF $9 MILLION TO FINANCE THE
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN OF THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION, JUST WHEN MRS VIOLETA
DE CHAMORRO HAS RECEIVED $3 MILLION FOR HERSELF.

   SUCH US GOVERNMENT AID FOR THE NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST SECTORS ALARMS
THE NICARAGUAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.  ELECTIONS WILL BE
HELD IN NICARAGUA IN A FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL
DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WHICH IS BEING CONDUCTED IN KEEPING WITH THE
COMMITMENTS ASSUMED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

   THIS DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS CANNOT BE NORMAL SINCE CONFRONTATIONS
BETWEEN CONTRAS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] ARE INCREASING, AND THESE ARE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNITED STATES.  AS IS KNOWN, THE SANDINIST
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND THE CESSATION OF MILITARY
OPERATION AGAINST THE SOMOSA FORCES, WHICH HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE
MAY 1988.

   MEANWHILE, WASHINGTON HAS ACCUSED THE SANDINISTS OF VIOLATING
DEMOCRACY AND OF HINDERING A [WORD INDISTINCT] POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] SUCH AN EVALUATION OF THE SANDINIST ACTION IS
UNJUST IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION, INCLUDING
NICARAGUA, IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE
CONFLICT MAKE AN EFFORT, NOT JUST ONE.

   LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR THESE DAYS.  IT LOOKED LIKE
THE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASE-FIRE HAD IMPROVED AND THIS IS WHY WE
APPLAUDED THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT].
BUT THE PROGRESS MADE WAS REJECTED BY THE RIGHTIST GROUPS WHICH
REFUSED TO HOLD CONSTRUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS IS WHY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] REFUSES TO HOLD THE THIRD
ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CHANGE THEIR OLD
METHODS OF SOLVING INTERNAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT GUARANTEEING THE SECURITY
OF THE LEFTIST FORCES.

   IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN NICARAGUA AND EL
SALVADOR ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE PEACE EFFORTS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES
ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED BY MILITARY FORCES FINANCED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONTINUES TO KEEP A HEATED ENVIRONMENT IN THOSE
COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF FORCE.

DEPARTMENT OF RISARALDA, QUINCHIA MAYOR SAUL BOTERO HAS REPORTED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE 8TH ARMY BRIGADE SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS
APPARENTLY THE WORK OF GUERRILLAS OF THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION

LOCATED AT VEREDA LA UNION, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM QUINCHIA.

THAT JORGE CASTILLO GARCIA, NICARAGUAN CONSUL IN COSTA RICA, WHO CAME
HERE TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, WAS SERIOUSLY
INJURED. HE WAS SHOT ON THE EVENING OF 5 NOVEMBER AT A TEGUCIGALPA
RESTAURANT.

   ARNALDO AMADOR, SECURITY GUARD AT THE DOMOS RESTAURANT TOLD POLICE
THAT CASTILLO, VISIBLY DRUNK, TRIED TO TAKE A MOTORCYCLE FROM IN FRONT
OF THE RESTAURANT. AMADOR ORDERED CASTILLO TO SURRENDER, BELIEVING HE
WAS A THIEF.

   ACCORDING TO AMADOR THE NICARAGUAN CONSUL ATTACKED HIM, HITTING HIM
ON THE HEAD. AMADOR SAYS HE THEN SHOT CASTILLO WITH HIS SUBMACHINEGUN,
WOUNDING HIM IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEST, VERY NEAR THE HEART.

   CASTILLO GARCIA WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE IS NOW
"RECOVERING", WHILE AMADOR HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.

   A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT, WHICH OCCURRED AT 2200 ON 5
NOVEMBER, DONAL OLIVA, SECRETARY OF THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY HERE, CAME
TO THE RESTAURANT TO GET DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT.

   OLIVA SAID THAT CASTILLO GARCIA HAD LEFT THE EMBASSY ABOUT 2 HOURS
BEFORE.  HE SAID THAT CASTILLO HAD ARRIVED IN HONDURAS LAST WEEK TO
PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS, ESTABLISHED ALONG THE
NICARAGUAN BORDER.

   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE (RADIO MAGALLANES) -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN
COMMUNIST PARTY] [TEXT] THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE WORST
ANTICOMMUNIST AND TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS IN A LONG TIME. THIS CAMPAIGN IS
SIMILAR TO THE ONE UNLEASHED BETWEEN 1964 AND 1970.  THE SITUATION IS
FURTHER AGGRAVATED BECAUSE IT IS TAKING PLACE UNDER A DICTATORSHIP
THAT WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.

   DURING HIS SPEECH IN COIHAIQUE, PINOCHET THREATENED TO END THE
STATE OF LAW.  THIS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER THREATS BY [DEPUTY
OPPONENTS, AND BY EQUALLY THREATENING STATEMENTS AND SYSTEMATIC
AGGRESSION AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS WHO CRITICIZE THE DICTATORIAL REGIME.

   MEANWHILE EL MERCURIO AND THE PROGOVERNMENT NEWS MEDIA HAVE
ORCHESTRATED A CAMPAIGN THAT IS FINANCED BY BUCHI'S ELECTORAL
MANAGERS. THIS CAMPAIGN USES EDITORIALS, ATTRIBUTED ARTICLES, AND PAID
ADS THAT ARE AIMED AT MISINFORMING AND MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION.

   THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A MOOD OF AGGRESSION TOWARD THE LEFT AND
TOWARD THE COMMUNIST PARTY, A MOOD THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY KIND OF
PROVOCATION.

   THE WORST EXAMPLE WAS A RECENT PAID AD PUBLISHED BY BUCHI'S
ELECTORAL MANAGERS ON AN ALLEGED THREAT OF COMMUNIST STRIKE SQUADS
THAT WERE GOING TO GUN DOWN THE PROGOVERNMENT CANDIDATE. IT IS WELL
KNOWN THAT THIS STATEMENT, REPORTEDLY MADE BY A YOUNG CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER TO LA SEGUNDA ON 31 OCTOBER, WAS LATER FLATLY
DENIED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER HIMSELF.  DESPITE THIS
DENIAL, BUCHI'S CAMPAIGN MANAGERS ARE STILL HARPING ON THE SUBJECT,
TRYING TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE AND UNEASE.

   THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JECAR NEGHME, UNSOLVED LIKE SO MANY OTHERS,
HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER SERIOUS EVENTS INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF
THE DRIVER OF VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY. THIS WAS A THREAT TO COMRADE VOLODIA TEITELBOIM'S
SAFETY AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN HARASSMENT OF
LEADERS AND CANDIDATES OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC
PARTIES, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ARBITRARY ARRESTS OF OPPONENTS
IN GENERAL, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW JOINT COMMAND HEADED BY THE
DEFENSE MINISTER. THE ALLEGED OBJECTIVE OF THIS COMMAND IS TO FIGHT
CRIME, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTLY GUESSED THAT IT IS A COVER FOR
POLITICAL REPRESSION SIMILAR TO THAT CONDUCTED BY A PRIOR ORGANIZATION
THAT BORE THE SAME NAME.

   IN THIS ANTICOMMUNIST AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE, MEETINGS HAVE
BEEN HELD WITH OFFICERS AND RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN. DURING THESE
MEETINGS THE AUDIENCE IS MISINFORMED, THREATENED, AND URGED TO OPPOSE
DEMOCRATIC CHANGES.  THEY ARE ALSO URGED TO HOARD STAPLES AND TO TAKE
SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOR EXTREME CONTINGENCIES.

   THERE IS YET ANOTHER ESPECIALLY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ABOUT WHICH WE
WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE.  WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS
SOURCES TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CROWNING POINT OF THIS ANTICOMMUNIST
CAMPAIGN WILL BE AN ATTACK ON A HIGH-RANKING ARMY OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN
CRITICIZED FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THE
CHARGES AGAINST THIS OFFICER MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY CANDIDATES FOR
SENATORS, AND THE DEMONSTRATIONS HELD AGAINST HIM BY THE RELATIVES OF
THE VICTIMS, WILL BE USED TO BLAME THE COMMUNISTS FOR THIS ATTACK.

   WE WANT TO REITERATE OUR ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND OUR DEMAND FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE. HOWEVER, WE ALSO WANT
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING TO HAVE EVERY CRIME AND EVERY
VIOLATION INVESTIGATED AND THE CULPRITS TRIED.

   THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE IS AIMED AT
TWISTING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND DESTABILIZING IN
ADVANCE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION.

   WE CALL UPON THE CITIZENRY TO BE PREPARED TO DISPLAY UNITY AND
DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION SO AS TO GUARANTEE THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ONGOING ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST ANY
PROVOCATION AIMED AT CREATING A CLIMATE FAVORABLE TO AN INTERRUPTION
OF THE PROCESS.  WE MUST DEPLOY OUR FORCES IF WE ARE TO ENSURE THE
VICTORY OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN A LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR PATRICIO
AYLWIN ON 14 DECEMBER AND THE ELECTION OF A CONGRESS CAPABLE OF
GUARANTEEING PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT MOST CHILEANS
WANT.

VENANCIO SALVATIERRA, WITH NOM DE GUERRE OF MARIO LOPEZ, A COMMANDER
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [SALVATIERRA] FROM THIS
STANDPOINT, THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT BY THE CHRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION TO SAN JOSE SOUGHT TO GAIN TIME WHILE KEEPING THE IMAGE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE.  HOWEVER, THE
GOVERNMENT WAS NOT REALLY SEEKING THE PATH TOWARD A NEGOTIATION.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT SOUGHT TO CONDUCT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE DIALOGUE
ACTIONS THAT WILL GIVE IT AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE FMLN, INCLUDING
TERRORIST ATTACKS LIKE THIS ONE.  THE OPERATION AGAINST THE FENASTRAS
LEADERSHIP IS PART OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND SO IS THE
WAVE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE MASS MOVEMENT FROM THE ONSET OF THIS
GOVERNMENT.

   THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED IN COSTA RICA INCLUDED MASS GROUPS AS PART
OF THE ENEMY.  ALL THESE THINGS ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICY.  WE
CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO HIDE THIS POLICY BEHIND THE DIALOGUE,
AS THIS POLICY ALLOWS ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE AT FENASTRAS TO GO
UNPUNISHED AND DO NOT LEAD TO A TRUE SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.  THAT
IS WHY THE FMLN SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN CARACAS, BUT HAS NOT
SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  IN FACT, THE FMLN HAS
UNDERTAKEN BIDS TO CONDUCT A MEDIATION SO THAT THE ADEQUATE CONDITIONS
FOR A DIALOGUE ARE CREATED AND ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE IN FENASTRAS DO
NOT CONTINUE.  DEEP DOWN, WE FEEL THAT IN ORDER FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
TURN INTO A NEGOTIATION THAT WILL END THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE PROGRESS OF THE MASS MOVEMENT IN EL
SALVADOR WITH ALL THE EXISTING FORMS OF STRUGGLE IS WHAT WILL COMPEL
THE OTHER SIDE TO REALLY SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.

   SO LONG AS THE OTHER SIDE FEELS THAT IT CAN DEFEAT THE PEOPLE, IT
WILL NOT BE TRULY COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT.
WHEN IT SEES THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT IT, AND THAT IT IS FORCED TO
NEGOTIATE, THEN A NEGOTIATION WILL TRULY TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS, EVEN
FOLLOWING THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES
NOT SEEM TO CHANGE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND THREATS
TO THE MASS MOVEMENT.  IN FACT, THE LUTHERAN CHURCH, OR RATHER ITS
PASTOR LEARDO GOMEZ, HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS.  DO YOU THINK AN
INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES IS POSSIBLE?  DO YOU THINK THAT
WITH THAT INTERNAL PURGE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE TO STOP THE EXTREME HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY?

   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED AN INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED
FORCES AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE OR
NEGOTIATIONS, MEANING THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES MUST GET RID OF
THE CORRUPT AND CRIMINAL ELEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS
THE NEED TO PURGE THE ARMED FORCES.  THE FMLN HAS TOLD THEM: PURGE
YOURSELVES.  HOWEVER, THAT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.  ON ONE SIDE,
THE NEED TO HAVE A TRUE PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES BECOMES APPARENT,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS AND HAVE TRUE DEMOCRACY IN
OUR COUNTRY.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE PROVING THE FMLN IS RIGHT.  ON
THE OTHER SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS CONTROL THE
MILITARY POWER AND HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL POWER.

   THE PRESENCE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE
CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL] IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION
CAMERAS, FOLLOWING THE DIALOGUE SESSION IN COSTA RICA, WAS MEANT TO
TELL THE PEOPLE: WE RULE AND CAN DO AS WE PLEASE.  THEN THE ATTACKS
CAME.  I FEEL THAT THE NEED TO END THAT SITUATION IS EVIDENT TO ALL,
AS WELL AS HOW RIGHT THE FMLN STAND IS.  I NOW WANT TO REITERATE THAT
WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNLESS WE FORCE THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT THAT PURGE.  BY FORCING THEM, I MEAN THAT THE
PEOPLE'S FORCE MUST TELL THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE.  THE
DEMAND THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF] LEAVE, AS HE IS ONE OF THE CHIEF CULPRITS OF THE
ABOVE-MENTIONED POLICY, WILL GROW STRONGER.  THE PEOPLE MUST PRESS AND
ARE PRESSING THIS DEMAND.

FOLLOWING RECENT INCIDENTS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE U.S.
OFFICIAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS
BERNARD ARONSON CAME TO OUR COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE
WILL DEPEND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO
OUR COUNTRY?

   [SALVATIERRA] IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE
AND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE
THAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT
ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT
UNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S
VISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S
INITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN
ORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE
GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S
INTENTION.

   AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID
ITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN
THE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED.
THEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS
OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO
CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR.

   IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF
LOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY
PLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO
BE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE
CENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS
WITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT
THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY
AND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE
IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC
COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THE FENASTRAS INCIDENTS, OUR FRONT
CANCELLED ITS ATTENDANCE AT THE CARACAS MEETING. WHAT ARE THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER
WORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS.  WE DIFFER WITH
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS.  FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.  THEY HAVE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CONCEPT.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THREE MILITANTS OF THE
SALVADORAN LEFTIST SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT (MPSC) HAVE BEEN
KILLED BY ARMY SOLDIERS IN THE CITY OF SONSONATE, APPROXIMATELY 50 KM
WEST OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THAT POLITICAL
ORGANIZATION.

   AMONG THE VICTIMS ARE CECILIO RIVERA, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MPSC
ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN EASTERN SONSONATE DEPARTMENT.  RIVERA WAS
SHOT TO DEATH ALONG WITH TWO OTHER PARTY MILITANTS WHOSE IDENTITIES
WERE NOT REVEALED.  JUAN JOSE MARTEL, A TOP MPSC LEADER, TOLD AFP THAT
AFTER LEAVING THE ORGANIZATION'S OFFICE ON THE NIGHT OF 6 NOVEMBER,
THREE MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED BY "A GROUP OF ARMED SOLDIERS IN CIVILIAN
CLOTHES BELONGING TO SONSONATE'S MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6.

   "WE HAVE LEARNED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THESE SAME
INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE APPEARED IN THE GARRISON LATER ON.  THEREFORE, WE
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ARMY SOLDIERS KILLED THEM," HE ADDED.

   MARTEL EXPLAINED THAT THE THREE BODIES WERE FOUND ON TUESDAY NEAR
THE CITY'S CEMETERY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BURIED BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES AS UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS.  HE NOTED THAT, BY CHANCE, A
NEIGHBOR IDENTIFIED RIVERA, AND THIS ALLOWED HIM TO SPREAD THE NEWS.

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRIPLE CRIME LEFT A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE
BODIES WHICH READ: "BECAUSE THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND."

   CONDEMNING THIS MURDER, MARTEL SAID THAT "THIS NEW ACTION SHOWS,
ONCE MORE, THAT IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY AND NO RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE DEATH SQUADS CONTINUE TO OPERATE."

   ON 19 OCTOBER, SUSPECTED DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS STAGED A BOMB ATTACK

ATTACK THE EXTREMISTS FLED TO THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

   AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATION AROUND 100 STUDENTS WERE ARRESTED ON
SUSPICION OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND SUBVERSIVE
LITERATURE WERE CONFISCATED FROM SOME OF THEM.

   POLITICAL TERRORISM HAS BECOME PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN PERU.
RECENTLY A SERIES OF ARMED ATTACKS HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN VARIOUS
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BY THE EXTREMIST GROUPING SENDERO LUMINOSO, WHICH
IS TRYING TO DISRUPT THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR 12 NOVEMBER.
IN TIRAPATA VILLAGE (PUNO DEPARTMENT) A SENDERO LUMINOSO DETACHMENT
SEIZED THE LOCAL MAYOR AND SHOT HIM IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE IN FRONT OF
LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO HAD BEEN MADE TO GO THERE.  IN THE TOWN OF SAN
CLEMENTE TERRORISTS THREW BOMBS AT THE HOMES OF MAYORAL CANDIDATES
FROM VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES.  IN THE VILLAGE OF CORIS (ANCASH
DEPARTMENT) SENDERO LUMINOSO FIGHTERS SET FIRE TO THE TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE AND THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND ALSO TOOK AWAY THE INHABITANTS'
VOTING CARDS -- THE MAIN IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT IN AN ELECTION.  THEY
THREATENED TO DEAL WITH ANYONE WHO TAKES PART IN THE MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS.

   AS A RESULT OF THE EXTREMISTS' THREATS AROUND 90 MAYORAL CANDIDATES
HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR NOMINATIONS, AS HAVE HUNDREDS OF CONTENDERS FOR
MUNICIPAL COUNCIL SEATS.

   SANTIAGO, 3 NOV 89 (EL MERCURIO) -- [TEXT] THE LAUTARO POPULAR
REBEL FORCES [FRPL] AND THE LAUTARO YOUTH MOVEMENT [MJL] HELD THEIR
CLANDESTINE PLENARY SESSION IN SANTIAGO 5 MONTHS AGO.  ONE OF THE
DECISIONS ADOPTED DURING THE SESSION WAS TO RECRUIT MINORS, SHANTYTOWN
YOUTHS, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS "TO FIGHT A GUERRILLA WAR IN CHILE,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MOTIVATION."

   THIS POLICY IS OUTLINED IN DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS THAT THOSE
TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CIRCULATED IN SHANTYTOWNS AND AMONG THEIR
MEMBERS.  SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED FROM
BOYS WHO WERE ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
LOOTING OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES AND IN THE BLOODY MURDERS OF
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL.

   SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SAY THAT "SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE OUR
STRATEGIC ALLIES," AND THAT THE MOVEMENTS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH
"THE REVOLUTIONARY FORM OF STRUGGLE AND WITH THE STRUGGLE IN THE
TRENCHES THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND EL SALVADOR HAVE USED" TO REMAIN IN
THE FOREFRONT OF LATIN AMERICAN SOCIALISM.

   THE TWO TERRORIST MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "SEIZURE" OF LAND,
LOOTINGS, OCCUPATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND "THE RECOVERY OF
FIREARMS" ARE THE MAIN TACTICS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE MASSES IN ORDER
TO "GAIN ELBOW ROOM."

   IN THE DOCUMENTS, THE MOVEMENTS ADVOCATE THE DISSEMINATION OF
VIOLENCE WITHIN THE MASSES, THE ADOPTION OF DEFENSIVE MEASURES IN
ORDER TO BEGIN AN OFFENSIVE, AND "A WAR BY EVERYONE" AS AN INEVITABLE
STEP FOR TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY.

   THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "THE FACT THAT THE REBEL ELEMENTS HAVE
DISCOVERED THEIR OWN GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE, THE POWER OF THE MASSES, AND
THE MASSIVE POTENTIAL OF YOUTHS, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF
THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."

   THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE THE TERRORIST ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE
MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] AND BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY LEFT [MIR], STRESSING THAT THE MJL AND THE FRPL ARE THE
TWO OTHER CHILEAN EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT "IMPLEMENT THE POLICY
OF THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION."

   AS FOR THE SO-CALLED "WAR BY EVERYONE," THE DOCUMENTS POINTS OUT
THAT "IN THE CHILEAN VERSION, THERE ARE IRREGULAR FORCES WITH TRAINING
IN SUBVERSIVE TACTICS AND STRATEGY."

   THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT THEIR MEMBERS OPERATE IN THE STREETS,
IN EDUCATION AND LABOR CENTERS, IN HIGH SCHOOLS, AND IN SHANTYTOWNS,
ADDING THAT "THE TACTICAL SEQUENCE OF ACTION AMONG THE MASSES SHOULD
BEGIN AND END WITH POPULAR UPRISINGS, WHICH LEAD TO A HIGHER STAGE OF
TRANSITION TOWARD "THE PEOPLE IN FLAMES" OR "THE PEOPLE IN ARMS."

   THE MOVEMENTS ADMIT THAT "THE ART OF REVOLUTION CONSISTS OF
AWAKENING THE AMBITION FOR POWER BY TEACHING THE MASSES TO DREAM OF
SOMETHING ELSE."

   ANOTHER PARAGRAPH OF THE LENGTHY DOCUMENTS STATES THAT: "WE DO NOT
DENY THE NEED TO REACH POLITICAL ACCORDS", WHICH WE -- AS A MATTER OF
PRINCIPLE --COMPLY WITH, BECAUSE "THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ADOPT A POSITION
OF INDEPENDENCE AND OF INITIATIVE IN THE OFFENSIVE, BECAUSE THE
REVOLUTIONS ARE FOUGHT IN THE STREETS AND IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF
THE COUNTRY."

   CONCERNING THE CREATION OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS (BEGINNING IN 1983),
THE DOCUMENTS STATE THAT "OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY PROPOSAL TAKES ROOT
IN THE "WAR BY EVERYONE," A SYSTEM WHICH SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND
TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONS HAVE USED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM
IMPERIALISM.  THE MOST INTENSE EXPRESSION OF THIS POLICY HAS BEEN
REFLECTED BY THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION, BY THE SUSTAINED STRUGGLE IN
EL SALVADOR, AND BY THE RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH INVASION BY THE
MAPUCHE PEOPLE, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF LAUTARO.

HOW TO OBTAIN WEAPONS

   IN A DOCUMENT DEALING WITH THE "REVOLTIONARY PROGRAM FOR CHILE,"
THE MOVEMENTS CLAIM THAT "OUR WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH THE
PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE, THROUGH WEAPON SEIZURES FROM THE ENEMY (THIS IS A
CLEAR ALLUSION TO THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS, WHOSE ARMS THEY SEIZE),
AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY."

   THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE "THE OFFENSIVE WAR WHICH WE ARE NOW WAGING
SEEKS TO ASPHYXIATE THE ENEMY, OVERWHELM IT, AND IMPEDE ITS INITIATIVE
AND THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS FORCES.  WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO CAUSE AS
MUCH DESTRUCTIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY AS POSSIBLE."

   THE TERRORISTS CALL ON "YOUTHS TO WAGE THIS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS," ADDING THAT "EVEN THOUGH THE HEAVIEST BURDEN
RESTS ON THE CITIES, THE COUNTRY AND RURAL AREAS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE
INSTALLATION OF STRATEGIC FACILITIES."

   THE REPORT ON THE FIRST NATIONAL PLENUM (WHICH IS DATED MAY 1989)
HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO "ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND MID-LEVEL
STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY OUR GROUPS."

   AMONG THE SLOGANS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH THE LAUTARO
MOVEMENT MEMBERS WILL USE THIS YEAR, ARE PHRASES LIKE "WE ARE A NEW
REVOLUTIONARY GENERATION," "WE ARE HAPPY, WE ARE REBEL, WE ARE ARMED,
AND THIS IS HOW WE WILL CARRY OUT THE REVOLUTION," "THE FATHERLAND FOR
THE PEOPLE," AND "FREE LOVE AND GUERRILLA."

   AFTER OUTLINING THE EIGHT TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH MAKE UP "THE
REVOLUTIONARY COURSE FOR THE MASSES WHO WILL FACE THE POLITICAL BREAK"
DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, THE TWO MOVEMENTS STATE THAT "WE TOTAL
APPROXIMATELY 500,000 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND SINCE 1983 WE HAVE
FOUGHT IN MORE THAN 30 TERRITORIES AND FRONTS."

   FINALLY, AS PART OF A SERIES OF CLEAR TERRORIST INSTRUCTIONS, THEY
CLAIM THAT THEY WORK "IN COORDINATION WITH THE FPMR AND WITH THE
MIR,"SO THAT "WITH THE YOUTH, THE PEOPLE, THE ARMS, AND THE IDEAS, WE
MAY TAKE OVER CHILE."

   NO CITY (HONDURAS), 8 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH AZCONA BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] NICARAGUA SAYS
THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY IS MOVING THE CONTRAS TO OLANCHO THIS WEEK SO
THEY WILL ESCAPE INSPECTION BY [WORD INDISTINCT].

   [AZCONA] NO, NO, NO. THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP, NO
CONTACTS, WITH THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF CARLOS FLORES'
SPEECH IN...[CHANGES THOUGHT] WHICH HAS BEEN SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY
SOME AND PRAISED BY OTHERS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [AZCONA] I THINK IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH. IT IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH
WHAT I HAVE SAID; THAT IS, THAT THE IMF'S PRESCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE
ACCEPTED AND APPLIED TO THIS COUNTRY, FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
WILL NOT PUT UP WITH MEASURES LIKE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY
THE IMF AND ENDORSED BY HONDURAN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT FLORES' STATEMENTS SAYING THAT RELATIONS WITH
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DIFFERENT IN HIS GOVERNMENT?

   [AZCONA] I DO NOT KNOW. THE RELATIONS WITH MY GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN
RELATIONS OF TOTAL UNITY. I THINK HE WAS NOT REFERRING TO THIS
ADMINISTRATION. HE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO A PREVIOUS

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [AZCONA] NO. I AM NOT BEING PRESSURED. WHAT I SAID THE OTHER DAY
HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED. WHEN I SAID I NEEDED OXYGEN, IT WAS NOT
OXYGEN THAT NEWSMEN, OR BUSINESSMEN, OR INTELLECTUALS WERE GOING TO
GIVE ME. I WAS GOING TO GIVE MYSELF THE OXYGEN BY NOT VETOING AN
AMENDMENT TO THE LAW ON ELECTIONS THAT INCREASES THE POLITICAL DEBT
AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] PER VOTE, PITTING THE PARTIES AGAINST EACH
OTHER--MY PARTY AND THAT OF OUR ADVERSARY. IN OTHER WORDS, I AM NOT
ASKING FOR FAVORS FROM ANYONE OR ANY SUCH THING. I HAVE MY CHIN HELD
HIGH. NOW, IF ANYBODY THROWS A BLOW AT ME I WILL RETURN IT IF I CAN.
I WILL DO SO WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF NOBLENESS AND PROPRIETY, BUT I WILL
RETURN IT. SO, IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF ME ASKING FOR OXYGEN. I AM
QUITE AT EASE, NOT LIKE A MINI-EDITORIAL WRITER SAID THE OTHER
DAY--EDITORIAL WRITERS CAN BE QUITE MEAN, YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]--WHO
SAID THAT I SLEPT LIKE A LOG THE FIRST 2 YEARS. I ALWAYS SLEEP LIKE A
LOG [LAUGHTER] AND DO NOT [WORD INDISTINCT].

   THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD MAKE ME LEAVE HERE A PHYSICAL WRECK OR
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WILL NOT SUCCEED. I THINK HE IS THE ONE WHO
CANNOT SLEEP LIKE A LOG WITH THE DIRTY CONSCIENCE HE MUST HAVE BECAUSE
OF THE DREADFUL THINGS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THOSE EDITORIALS.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT AID HAS EVEN CUT
THE AID FOR SMALL PROGRAMS, BECAUSE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] AND THAT
HONDURAS HAS TO PAY OVER 2 MILLION [CURRENCY NOT SPECIFIED]...

   [AZCONA] [INTERRUPTING] THAT IS NOT TRUE, NOT TRUE. ALL AID
PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING. A FEW DAYS AGO, THE PRESS ALSO MADE AN IMPROPER
INTERPRETATION WHEN I SAID THAT MILITARY AID WAS BEING CUT.  NO. WHAT
HAPPENS IS THAT, IN THE CASE OF AID, IF THERE IS A DELAY IN PAYMENTS
OF OVER 1 YEAR ON ANY PROGRAM, THE DISBURSEMENTS OF ALL PROGRAMS ARE
STOPPED. THERE WAS A PAYMENT CORRESPONDING TO MILITARY AID, OR
MILITARY COMMITMENTS, THAT HAD NOT BEEN MADE. SO, WE HAD TO
 MAKE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISBURSEMENTS NOT ONLY OF THE MILITARY
SECTOR BUT OF ALL WOULD BE SUSPENDED. IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT IS
COVERED, AND, AS I SAY, ALL THAT IS PROCEEDING QUITE WELL.  [CONTINUED]

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 8 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN ARMY SAID TODAY THAT TWO "ATTACKERS" HAD LOST THEIR LIVES
WHEN THEY CONFRONTED SOLDIERS AFTER HAVING "ROBBED AND RAPED" THE
OWNER OF A BUSINESS IN A CITY OF WESTERN EL SALVADOR.  OPPOSITION
SOURCES, HOWEVER, REJECTED THIS ACCOUNT AND DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT AS
"MURDER."

   JUAN JOSE MARTELL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC, OPPOSITION), REJECTED THE MILITARY VERSION AND ACCUSED THE ARMY
OF "MURDERING" PARTY LEADER CECILIO RIVERA AND TWO OTHER PARTY
SUPPORTERS.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID THAT RIVERA AND APOLINARIO
ALFARO -- THE THIRD PERSON WAS NOT MENTIONED -- LOST THEIR LIVES WHEN
THEY CONFRONTED, ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER MEN, TROOPS OF MILITARY
DETACHMENT NO.  6, IN SONSONATE, 65 KM WEST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE MILITARY REPORT ADDED THAT THE "CRIMINALS" HAD ROBBED A SMALL
SHOP, WHOSE OWNER, MARIA TERESA LOPEZ, HAD BEEN "RAPED" BY THE
ATTACKERS.

   MARTELL SAID THAT THE BODIES OF THE [MPSC] MEMBERS WERE FOUND LAST
NIGHT AT THE SONSONATE CEMETERY ALONG WITH A SIGN THAT READ: "BECAUSE
THEY BETRAYED THE FATHERLAND."

   "WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIVERA'S MURDER AND
THE TWO OTHER [MPSC] SUPPORTERS ARE SOLDIERS OF MILITARY DETACHMENT
NO. 6," MARTELL STRESSED.

   THE [MPSC] IS PART OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION,
WHICH TOOK PART IN THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, THE ARMY HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF
KIDNAPPING APPROXIMATELY 30 PEASANTS IN CUSCATLAN AND SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENTS, LOCATED TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF SAN SALVADOR,
RESPECTIVELY.

   MEANWHILE, THE REBELS STEPPED-UP THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE

TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING JUDGES
AND MAGISTRATES, IS ILLEGAL.  THE STRIKE, WHICH BEGAN ON 3 NOVEMBER,
IS TO DEMAND THE ADOPTION OF SECURITY MEASURES.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SAID TODAY THAT THE STRIKE BY THE
JUDICIAL BRANCH "IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE ITS EMPLOYEES PROVIDE A PUBLIC
SERVICE."  "THE GOVERNMENT," HE ADDED, "HAS TRIED TO HANDLE THIS
SITUATION VERY CAREFULLY, UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS
UPSET BECAUSE OF TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST ITS MEMBERS."

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS BEGAN THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE
COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN 1984 WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF JUSTICE
MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  DURING THE 2 MONTHS OF THE "TOTAL WAR"
COLOMBIA HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOME 20 MAGISTRATES
AND JUDGES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY "NARCO-TERRORISTS."

   THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES

BY REITERATING U.S.  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COUNTRY'S MILITARY STRUGGLE IS ENCOURAGED.
HOWEVER, THE GROUP NOTED THAT ARONSON'S PRESENCE ALSO SERVES TO REVEAL

   LIMA, 9 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE
THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER, TERRORISTS HAVE
STEPPED UP THEIR VIOLENCE AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR
ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL PERUVIAN REGIONS.

   SHINING PATH MEMBERS LAST NIGHT BOMBED AN OFFICE OF THE RULING
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) PARTY IN LIMA, INJURING
FOUR PEOPLE, ONE OF THEM SERIOUSLY.

   DURING THE ATTACK THE OFFICE WAS SET ON FIRE. AN EYEWITNESS SAID
THAT SOME 150 ELECTORAL CARDS WERE BURNED. THE CARDS, WHICH ARE THE
ONLY VALID DOCUMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS, HAD BEEN TAKEN
TO THE PARTY OFFICE SO THAT THE VOTING STATION COULD BE DEFINED.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX BOMBINGS LAST NIGHT IN
THE ANDEAN CITY OF AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE LIMA.  THE
SOURCES, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE ATTACKED.

   ON 7 NOVEMBER, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BLEW UP 4 PYLONS IN THE
VICINITY OF AYACUCHO, RAZING TO 17 THE NUMBER OF PYLONS THAT HAVE BEEN
BLOWN UP BY THIS MAOIST ORGANIZATION IN AYACUCHO AND IN ZONES OF
HUANCAVELICA DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

   A SHINING PATH "ELIMINATION COMMANDO" MURDERED A NATIONAL POLICE
COMMANDER ON 7 NOVEMBER IN THE RESIDENTIAL LIMA DISTRICT OF
MIRAFLORES.  THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED A POWER OUTAGE IN TOWNS OF THE
HUAYLAS VALLEY, IN THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
OF ANCASH, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF TWO PYLONS.

   IN ONE OF THE TOWNS -- RANRAHIRCA -- THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE
SHINING PATH MEMBERS SET THE CITY HALL FACILITY ON FIRE, DESTROYING
VALUABLE DOCUMENTS.  IN LA OROYA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL
PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE, PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE BOMBED AND A CAR-BOMB
WAS DETONATED.

   REPORTS RECEIVED FROM AYACUCHO AND FROM OTHER RURAL AREAS SAY THAT
TERRORISTS ARE STOPPING VEHICLES IN HIGHWAYS AND THAT THEY ARE
STRIPPING PASSENGERS OF THEIR ELECTORAL CARDS, WHICH THEY THEN
DESTROY.

   IN VIEW OF THIS ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, THE GOVERNMENT ON 7
NOVEMBER DECREED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE 10 PROVINCES OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF LIMA, PLACING THEM UNDER MILITARY CONTROL.  THIS IS THE
PERUVIAN DEPARTMENT WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION AND WITH THE LARGEST
NUMBER OF VOTERS.  IT HAS MORE THAN 6,000,000 PEOPLE, AND INCLUDES THE
PORT OF CALLAO.

   ON 6 NOVEMBER, THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES IMPOSED A CURFEW BETWEEN
1000 AND 0500 IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUNIN AND PASCO IN THE CENTRAL
MOUNTAIN RANGE.  THE SAME MEASURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ENFORCED IN
AYACUCHO, APURIMAC, AND HUANCAVELICA.

   THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND OF THE AYACUCHO EMERGENCY ZONE LAST
NIGHT ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE ENFORCING STRICT MEASURES THAT WILL BE
OBSERVED BY THE PEOPLE DURING THE ELECTIONS.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT AS OF 13 NOVEMBER, THOSE ELECTORAL CARD
THAT DO NOT BEAR THE SEAL THAT IS STAMPED AT THE VOTING STATIONS AND
WHICH PROVES THAT THE BEARER HAS CAST HIS VOTE WILL BE ARRESTED AND
"PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE COURTS."

   IT ADDS THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO TRAVEL,TO MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS, TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS, OR TO PERFORM COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTIONS, THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW THEIR ELECTORAL CARD WITH THE
CORRESPONDING SEAL, UNDER PENALTY OF BEING FORBIDDEN TO PROCEED.

   DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, THE TECHNICAL POLICE PRESENTED
27 ALLEGED SHINING PATH MEMBERS WHO WERE CAPTURED IN SOUTHERN LIMA
PROVINCES AND IN ICA. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH BEING INVOLVED IN AT LEAST
40 ATTACKS AND MURDERS OF AUTHORITIES, AND WITH PLANNING FUTURE
ATTACKS AGAINST ELECTORAL OFFICES AND CANDIDATES IN THE UPCOMING
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

   COMBINED MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES YESTERDAY RAIDED THE SAN
FERNANDO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF THE LIMA UNIVERSITY OF SAN MARCOS,
ARRESTING 600 PERSONS AND SEIZING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   BUENOS AIRES, 9 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE MOTOR
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION [UTA] BEGAN AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT,
CONTRADICTING GOVERNMENT ORDERS WHICH STATED THAT THE UTA AND THE
ARGENTINE FEDERATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PASSENGER CARRIERS [FATAP] MUST
SOLVE THE SALARY PROBLEM THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.

   THE SITUATION ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE STOPPAGE IS SLIGHTLY BETTER,
ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE STREETS
TRYING TO GET ON THE FEW BUSES BEING DRIVEN BY THEIR OWNERS.

   A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR TRANSPORTATION NESTOR
FERNANDEZ ANNOUNCED THAT AT MIDDAY ONLY 30 PERCENT OF THE USUAL NUMBER
OF BUSES IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL WERE WORKING NORMALLY; BECAUSE OF
THIS, MEASURES WILL BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF
THE BUSES WILL RUN TODAY.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FEDERAL POLICE, THE BUENOS AIRES PROVINCIAL
POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GENDERMERIE ARE MEETING AT TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT OFFICES TO STUDY WAYS OF RESTORING NORMAL BUS SERVICE.

   SUBWAY CHAIRMAN JOSE BARBERO REPORTS THAT HIS SECTOR'S SERVICES
HAVE ALSO IMPROVED, AND FIVE SUBWAY LINES ARE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.
ALTHOUGH THE SUBWAY PERSONNEL ARE MEMBERS OF THE UTA, THEY HAVE
DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR STRIKE.

   THE RAILROAD SERVICE IS NORMAL.  MORE COACHES WILL BE PUT INTO
SERVICE, AND THE NUMBER OF TRAINS IN SERVICE WILL BE INCREASED, BUT
TRAINS OF THE ROCA LINE CONNECTING CONSTITUCION TO LA PLATA THROUGH
THE TEMPERLEY STRETCH ARE DELAYED BECAUSE OF A DERAILMENT.

   UTA SECRETARY GENERAL JUAN MANUEL PALACIOS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE
INDEFINITE STRIKE WILL CONTINUE AND THAT THE UTA WILL NOT ACCEPT
COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A LEGAL SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT.  HE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD MERELY PUT OFF THE PROBLEM FOR A
MONTH OR SO.  PALACIOS ADDED THAT IT WOULD ONLY CREATE MORE
DIFFICULTIES FOR THE WORKERS.

   FATAP DIRECTOR LUIS CARRAL ASSERTED THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WILL
DOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO PUT THE BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE.  CARRAL SAID
THAT IN VIEW OF COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS FATAP WILL URGE WORKERS TO
RETURN TO THEIR JOBS UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE DISMISSED.

   TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BUSINESSMEN HAVE INFORMED THE TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT THAT A FEW DRIVERS ARE RETURNING TO WORK.  BUSINESSMEN
BELIEVE THAT IN A FEW MORE HOURS 40-50 PERCENT OF THE BUSES WILL BE
FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

   PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM COMMENTED THIS MORNING ON THE UTA ATTITUDE:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  WE CANNOT
PAY MORE THAN WE HAVE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESSMEN HAVE OFFERED A
BASIC SALARY OF AROUND 75,000 AUSTRALES PER MONTH.  UNTIL YESTERDAY
THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED NEARLY $100, AND THIS IS A GOOD INCREASE.

   EVIDENTLY, THERE IS A POLITICAL INFILTRATION OF IDEAS THAT ARE NOT
SHARED BY ALL ARGENTINE PEOPLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFILTRATION
COMES FROM PERONIST OR RADICAL MOVEMENTS.  THIS IS THE
 WORK OF THE ULTRA-LEFT.  [END RECORDING]

   MENEM ASSERTED THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK AND WHO ARE SACRIFICING
THEMSELVES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE REWARDED.  HE URGED
THEM NOT TO LEAVE THEIR POSTS.  MENEM ADDED THAT YESTERDAY MANY
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ASKED HIM NOT TO GIVE IN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
HAS DECIDED NOT GIVE IN, NOT BECAUSE HE IS STUBBORN, BUT BECAUSE
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES CANNOT BE DEFRAUDED.

   ASKED IF THE RAILROADS THAT JOIN THE STRIKE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN,
MENEM SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THE RAILROAD LINES THAT STRIKE WILL BE
CLOSED.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] BUT MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT
TRANSPORTATION.

   [MENEM] WE WILL FIND A WAY OF GETTING THESE PEOPLE TO THEIR JOBS.
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF ATTITUDE.  OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE
THE COUNTRY EXPLODE?  [END RECORDING]

   AT 1700 THIS AFTERNOON THE CABINET MEETING THAT STARTED LAST NIGHT
WILL BE RECONVENED.  THE CABINET MEMBERS ATTENDING THE MEETING WILL
ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY THE UTA DECISION TO CONTINUE THE
STRIKE.  THE MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ROOM UNDER
THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA.  JUSTICIALIST
LEADER ANTONIO CAFFIERO WILL ATTEND THE MEETING.  PRES MENEM WILL NOT
ATTEND.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 50 BUS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN URGED TO
RETURN TO NORMAL WORK; OTHERWISE DECREE 429, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE
TEMPORARY CONFISCATION OF BUSES, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.  THIS DECREE,
WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY PRESIDENT MENEM, ESTABLISHES THAT BUSES
WILL BE CONFISCATED AND DRIVEN BY NATIONAL GENDARMERIE PERSONNEL.

   IN A JUSTICIALIST PARTY COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ANTONIO CAFFIERO, THE
PARTY EXPRESSES ITS SUPPORT FOR THE DECISIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT MENEM.

   COMMANDER ADALINO BARBERI, THE NATIONAL GENDARMERIE DIRECTOR
GENERAL, HAS REPORTED THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS
ARE STILL STUDYING THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO CONFISCATE THE BUSES
FROM THE OWNERS WHO FAIL TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTIONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT
OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY REAFFIRMED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN
WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION].  IT ALSO MADE AN APPEAL SO THAT NO
ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT ARE MADE IN ORDER NOT TO
GENERATE SPECULATIONS THAT POLITICIZE THIS CASE.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE PRECEDING
STATEMENT BECAUSE OF THE "BIASED PROPAGANDISTIC CAMPAIGN BEING
DEVELOPED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AND
OTHER POLITICAL AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS, SEEKING TO CREATE A
DISTORTED VIEW OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE COMMUNIQUE RECALLS THAT ON THE SAME DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK
AGAINST FENASTRAS, THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION.  THE
COMMUNIQUE ALSO EXPRESSES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A COMMISSION THAT WILL BE COMPOSED OF
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, CEDES [SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE], POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS --
INCLUDING ONE FROM FENASTRAS -- DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER.

   HOWEVER, FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED HINDERING THE
INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE FENASTRAS REFUSAL TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMISSION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "AN INTENTIONAL
PLAN BY FENASTRAS LEADERS TO PREVENT THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRORIST ATTACK."  THEREFORE, THE
GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REQUESTS THE ABANDONMENT OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE.

   THE GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, BELIEVES THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS LEGAL AND THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE MORAL DUTY TO HELP
IN THE INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THIS CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REITERATED ITS APPEAL TO
CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT SPECULATION THAT HAMPERS THE NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  THE
GOVERNMENT REITERATED THAT "ITS TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY THIS
BARBARIC ACTION AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY
ARE."

   "WE REQUEST ALL CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM ISSUING SPECULATIVE
OPINIONS, AND, SHOULD THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT THAT WOULD HELP
CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, THEY SHOULD DO IT WITHIN THE
JUDICIAL PROCESS," THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES.

   THE GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE SEARCHING
FOR PEACE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS AND DIALOGUE.  ACCORDING TO THE
MEXICO AGREEMENTS, THE FLMN IS ALSO OBLIGED TO CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS AND "CANNOT UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
VIOLATING NOT ONLY THOSE AGREEMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ASPIRATION OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHICH IS TO ATTAIN PEACE," THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS.

MAGAZINE. HE JUSTIFIED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC
FRONT [FPMR] AND THE COMMUNISTS' RIGHT TO HAVE MILITARY TRAINING.

   THE FORMER PCCH SECRETARY GENERAL SAID THAT HIS PARTY IS WORKING
HARD FOR AYLWIN'S TRIUMPH ON THE 14 DECEMBER ELECTIONS. HE SAID THAT
IF AYLWIN WINS THE ELECTIONS, THE PCCH IS READY TO PARALYZE THE
COUNTRY IF ANY SECTOR THREATENS THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

   THE PCCH LEADER POINTED OUT THE NEED TO MODIFY THE CHILEAN JUDICIAL
BRANCH SUBSTANTIALLY. HE REQUESTED SPECIAL COURTS, LIKE THE ONES THAT
EXISTED IN NUREMBERG, TO TRY THE MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION.

   CORVALAN REQUESTED THE FREEDOM OF THE SO-CALLED POLITICAL
PRISONERS, INCLUDING FPMR AND LAUTARO MOVEMENT TERRORISTS. HE SAID HE
DOES NOT CARE WHETHER LEFTIST SYMPATHIZERS ARE INVOLVED IN ANY CRIME,
INCLUDING IN THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS.

   THE PCCH WILL HELP PATRICIO AYLWIN FACE HIS ENEMIES DURING THE NEXT
ADMINISTRATION, CORVALAN SAID.

   CLANDESTINE, 9 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [TEXT] [BEGIN
RECORDING] [HANDAL, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] WHAT DOES THIS TELL US?  WHAT MESSAGE DOES THIS
CONVEY?  IT TELLS US THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SO-CALLED SUPPORT
ORGANIZATIONS -- THE COPREFA [ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] CALLS THEM
FRONTS -- ARE COMPONENTS OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR.

   WHEN THEY SIT DOWN TO TALK TO THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
ENEMY, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], AND WHEN
THEY NEGOTIATE ISSUES LIKE THE END TO HOSTILITIES, THE GOVERNMENT
IMMEDIATELY MAKE DEMANDS AND ALL THESE POLITICAL, IDEOLOGICAL,
PSYCHOLOGICAL, ETCETERA, ETCETERA, ACTIONS STOP.  THE MESSAGE THIS
CONVEYS IS THAT AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, ALL THOSE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PART OF THE ENEMY SIDE IN THE WAR.  WHAT HAPPENED
LATER WAS THE CREATION OF MANY SUCH FRONTS.  THE REPRESSION HAS BEEN
GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND HAD INCREASED.  HOWEVER, THE
GOVERNMENT HAD NEVER PRESENTED AN IDEA LIKE THIS ONE.  ONCE IT DID,
EVERYTHING BECAME VERY CLEAR.  ALL THE PAST ACTIONS ARE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S AND THE ARMY'S WAR ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS
AND DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
MASSACRE WAS PART OF THIS PLAN.  THE KILLING OF 3 MEMBERS OF THE MPSC
[SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT] IN SONSONATE CARRIED OUT BY THE
6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT IN FRONT OF WITNESSES -- THEY LEFT MESSAGES ON
THE BODIES STATING THAT THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THE HOMELAND -- WAS
CARRIED OUT WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION OF SENDING ANOTHER MESSAGE.  THE
MESSAGE IS: NOT ONLY IN THEORY DO WE CONSIDER YOU COMPONENTS OF THE
ENEMY SIDE.  YOU ARE THE ENEMY AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE KILLING YOU.
[END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE VISIT TO EL SALVADOR OF BERNARD ARONSON, ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK
HANDAL SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HANDAL] THE HEADS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND
MILITARY UNITS WHO CARRIED OUT THESE CRIMES REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THOSE
WHO GAVE THE ORDERS REMAIN IN OFFICE.  THEN HOW CAN AN INVESTIGATION
BE CARRIED OUT?  A CHAIN OF COMMAND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN THE MILITARY.
IF A SUBORDINATE IS GOING TO BE INTERROGATED, ONE MUST FIRST ASK
PERMISSION FROM HIS SUPERIOR, AND THEY ARE THE SUPERIORS.  BESIDES, NO
ONE KNOWS WHO THE SUBORDINATES WHO PARTICIPATED ARE.  THAT INFORMATION
MUST COME FROM THE ARMY.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAST THEY
CAN DO BEFORE THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING THIS INCIDENT IS REMOVE COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.  THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  I WOULD EVEN
ADD THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE REMOVED.

   IF WE WERE LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM
AND WITH LABOR UNIONS, THAT WOULD BE COMMON PRACTICE.  IT WOULD NOT
EVEN BE NECESSARY TO BRING THIS UP AT A PUBLIC DEBATE.  THE FIRST
THING THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE DONE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
ARMED FORCES -- HE IS INVOLVED IN THESE CRIMES BECAUSE HE IS COMMANDER
IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES -- IS REMOVE THEM AND NOT SAY THAT HE WAS
NOT CONSULTED ON THIS MATTER.  HE CLAIMS HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS,
BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND WE KNOW THAT HE KNEW.
BUT IF HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW,
THEN THE FIRST THING HE SHOULD DO IS WHAT ANY MAN WITH ANY
SELF-RESPECT WOULD DO: ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, HE IS
HINDERING THE INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS WHAT IS ALWAYS DONE WHEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.  WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN, A FEW --
THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MATTERS CLARIFIED -- RESIGN, WHILE OTHERS ARE
REMOVED. [CONTINUED]

SOME LINKS BETWEEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION

DR MANUEL PACAS CASTRO SAID IN SANTIAGO DE CHILE.  DURING HIS OFFICIAL
VISIT TO CHILE, THE SALVADORAN MINISTER MET WITH PRESIDENT AUGUSTO
PINOCHET AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

   PACAS CASTRO AND HIS CHILEAN COUNTERPART HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ
SIGNED A JOINT DECLARATION EXPRESSING "THEIR CONCERN OVER TERRORIST
ACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE FOREIGN SUPPORT TO SUBVERSIVE
GROUPS."

   THE TWO MINISTERS STATED THAT THE "GUERRILLA" ACTIONS HINDER
DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND BASICALLY AFFECT THE MOST
NEEDY SECTORS."

   IN THE DOCUMENT, CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER ERRAZURIZ EXPRESSES "THE
SUPPORT OF THE CHILEAN GOVERMENT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS PROMOTED BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND FOR THE PEACE EFFORTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA."

   FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION, FOREIGN MINISTER PACAS
TOLD NEWSMEN THAT "GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA ARE OF
CASTRO-COMMUNIST INSPIRATION."  HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENTS OF
CUBA AND NICARAGUA.

   "THE MAIN INSTIGATOR IS FIDEL CASTRO," HE ADDED.  "ALL THOSE GROUPS
HAVE A COMMON DENOMINATOR AND ADOPT THEIR OWN METHODS IN EACH
COUNTRY."

   PACAS DID NOT RULE OUT THERE MAY BE SOME LINKS BETWEEN THE FMLN AND
CHILEAN GUERRILLAS.  "I AM NOT AWARE OF A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP," HE
CLARIFIED.  "HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT POSSIBILITY BECAUSE
CITIZENS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR TO FIGHT."

   IN CONCLUSION, HE ADDED: "WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE HAD THEIR TRAINING CENTERS IN NICARAGUA."

POLICE HAVE ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZEN JORGE HUMBERTO CHALARIA, KNOWN
AS "EL NEGRO," THE REPRESENTATIVE IN MEXICO OF COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKER GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO,"
THE TOP CHIEF OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
(PGR) MADE KNOWN TODAY.

   CHALARIA, 30 YEARS OLD, 5 OTHER COLOMBIANS, 1 VENEZUELAN, AND 12
MEXICANS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED "IN THE LAST 2 DAYS" AND 550 KG OF PURE
COCAINE HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED IN OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN THIS CITY AND
IN THE STATES OF SONORA AND TAMAULIPAS, A PGR SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE GANG OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS LED BY CHALARIA WERE ABLE TO DELIVER
OVER 50 TONS OF PURE COCAINE TO THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA
IN THE LAST 4 YEARS, THE PGR SPOKESMAN ADDED.

   "EL NEGRO" CONFESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN MEXICO SINCE 1988 UNDER
THE ORDERS OF GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE.

   THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING GANG HAD THE PROTECTION OF
ARTURO CUELLAR TIJERINA, COMMANDER OF THE TAMAULIPAS JUDICIAL POLICE,
WHO WAS ALSO ARRESTED.

   CUELLAR AND A GROUP OF POLICEMEN UNDER HIS ORDERS SUPPLIED FUEL TO
THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHO BROUGHT THE DRUG INTO MEXICO BY MEANS OF
LIGHT AIRCRAFT, WHICH LANDED ON CLANDESTINE RUNWAYS NEAR THE BORDER
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

   THOSE ARRESTED CONFESSED THAT AMERICAN JULIO CHAGY DE LA ROSA, A
MIAMI RESIDENT, DISTRIBUTED THE DRUG AND "LAUNDERED" THE MONEY
OBTAINED IN THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BUSINESS THROUGH A COMPANY CALLED
"ITAL BAGNO," WHICH SUPPOSEDLY MANUFACTURED STOVES.

   THEY SAID THAT ON 29 OCTOBER THEY RECEIVED A LOAD OF 550 KG OF PURE
COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA, BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY FROM A RANCH LOCATED
IN SONORA. THE NARCOTICS POLICE DETECTED THE ILLEGAL OPERATION AT THE
RANCH AND ARRESTED ALFONSO CASTILLO ARMENTA AND HIS DAUGHTER, WHO HAD
MODERN RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE
COLOMBIAN PLANES AND WITH "EL NEGRO."

   THE INVESTIGATIONS LED THE POLICE TO A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN
THIS CAPITAL, WHERE "EL NEGRO" HAD RENTED A HOME IN WHICH HE LIVED
WITH A VENEZUELAN WOMAN BY THE NAME OF CRIATINA ROSAS RODRIGUEZ, WHO
COVERED UP THE ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY HER COMPANION.

   THE ARREST IS THE THIRD HEAVY BLOW DEALT ON THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG
TRAFFICKING BUSINESS BY THE MEXICAN POLICE IN THE LAST 3 WEEKS.

   ON 19 OCTOBER, THE POLICE ARRESTED COLOMBIANS RODRIGO DIZUNZA
OCHOA, NEPHEW OF DRUG TRAFFICKER FABIO OCHOA, AND ALFREDO AGUILAR
CASTRO, NEPHEW OF COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO HAD
10 KG OF PURE COCAINE IN THEIR POSSESSION.

   EARLY THIS MONTH, MEXICAN RAFAEL MUNOZ TALAVERA WAS ARRESTED.  HE
ALLEGEDLY OWNS THE 20 TONS OF PURE COCAINE DISCOVERED IN A WAREHOUSE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, IN SEPTEMBER.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS DE GORTARI TOOK OFFICE LAST
DECEMBER, THE MEXICAN NARCOTICS POLICE HAVE CONFISCATED 23 TONS OF
PURE COCAINE AND HAVE ARRESTED NEARLY 10,000 DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

FRONT 1827 [EJERCITO DE RESISTENCIA PATRIOTICA 1827], (ERP-27), A
HERETOFORE UNKNOWN LEFTIST GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, ANNOUNCED ITS
PRESENCE TODAY IN HONDURAS WITH A PROPAGANDA ACTION.

   TWO DEVICES DESIGNED TO DISTRIBUTE PROPAGANDA EXPLODED IN THIS
CAPITAL, ISSUING THE FIRST ERP-27 PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE
ORGANIZATION DEMANDS THAT THE NICARAGUAN "CONTRAS" AND "THE U.S.
TROOPS" LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

   THE ERP-27 CLAIMED "THE HONDURAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FIGHT WITH
WEAPONS AND EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS UNTIL THE U.S. MILITARY OCCUPATION
AND ALL FORMS OF FOREIGN SUBJUGATION END."

   THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION'S COMMUNIQUE ALSO DEMANDS RESPECT FOR
THE PRESIDENTIAL AGREEMENTS WHICH SEEK TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL
AMERICA AND "THE END OF THE CRIMINAL WAR AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE."

   THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE ERP-27 IN HONDURAS BUT ITS
PUBLIC APPEARANCE COINCIDES WITH A NEW ANNIVERSARY OF THE LA TRINIDAD
BATTLE, WHICH OCCURRED ON 11 NOVEMBER 1827, THE FIRST MILITARY VICTORY
OF NATIONAL HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN. MORAZAN, A HONDURAN BY BIRTH, IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT HISTORICAL FIGURE AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN LEVEL.
HE FOUGHT AGAINST CONSERVATIVE SECTORS TO CREATE A SINGLE REPUBLIC
UNDER LIBERAL IDEAS, AND HE WAS EXECUTED BY HIS ADVERSARIES IN 1842 IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.

   MORAZAN IS EXTOLLED BY THE POPULAR AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE
COUNTRY, AND THERE IS EVEN ONE GUERRRILLA ORGANIZATION CALLED THE
"MORAZANISTA FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF HONDURAS.

   THE ERP-27 IS THE SIXTH LEFTIST ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS DECLARED

ATTACK DID NOT CAUSE MUCH DAMAGE TO THE GARRISON; INSTEAD, TWO
CHILDREN WERE KILLED." THE CHILDREN WERE 1 AND 1/2 - AND 4-YEARS- OLD.
TWO SOLDIERS WERE ALSO WOUNDED.

   URBAN GUERRILLAS TODAY HURLED BOMBS AT THE NATIONAL GUARD
HEADQUARTERS.  ONE OF THE BOMBS EXPLODED INSIDE THE MILITARY

   MEANWHILE, OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORTED THAT THE ARMY AND REBELS HAVE
SUSTAINED AT LEAST 20 CASUALTIES DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AS A RESULT

   [SPOKESMAN] WE HAVE TOURED SOME PLACES WHERE NON-MILITARY POSITIONS
HAVE BEEN HARASSED.  THESE ARE THE VANGUARD POSTS OF THE MILITARY
POSITIONS THAT DETECTED THE TERRORISTS WHEN THEY TRIED TO ATTACK. THAT
IS HOW THESE CLASHES BEGAN.

   THE MAIN AREAS WHERE THIS HARASSMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE ARE IN THE
SOUTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREAS OF LA
GUADALUPE AND MEJICANOS, AS WELL AS IN THE AREA OF SANTA TECLA.
HOWEVER, WE WANT TO REPORT, THAT THIS IS ONLY HARASSMENT. THE PEOPLE
SHOULD REMAIN CALM, AS WE ARE WORKING FOR THEIR BENEFIT.

   [REPORTER] AS OF NOW, WE HAVE HAD REPORTS THAT THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

   [SPOKESMAN] WELL, AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER, THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS
HARASSED THE VANGUARD POSTS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THE
INSTALLATIONS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, PER SE, HAVE NOT BEEN
DAMAGED AT ALL, AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE?

   [SPOKESMAN] WE TELL OUR PEOPLE: REMAIN CALM, YOUR ARMED FORCES ARE
WORKING TO SOLVE THIS SITUATION. WE REMIND YOU THAT IF YOU SEE ANY
SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT NEAR YOUR HOMES, YOU MUST REPORT IT TO THE NEAREST
MILITARY UNIT. HAVE ON HAND THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
SECURITY CORPS, OR TELEPHONE NUMBER 123. THE COOPERATION THAT OUR
PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE US IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS
SITUATION IMMEDIATELY. AS IT IS EVIDENT, THE HARASSMENT BEING WAGED BY
THE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS IS NOT AGAINST THE MILITARY UNITS. WE MUST
CONSIDER THIS IS JUST ONE MORE INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK THAT SEEKS A
BLOODBATH [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].

WOUNDED--SEVEN CIVILIANS AND TWO SOLDIERS--DURING AN OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER
SALVADORAN CITIES, HUMANITARIAN INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPORTED.

   DURING THE OFFENSIVE, GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ATTACKED PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE AND
MILITARY GARRISONS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES.

   THE RED CROSS SENT DOZENS OF AMBULANCES TO THE AREAS MOST EFFECTED
TO EVACUATE THE INJURED AND CITIZENS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS.

   EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, SPORADIC BOMB EXPLOSIONS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE
COULD STILL BE HEARD IN SOME PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY HAS
IMPLEMENTED STRICT CONTROL ON THE DESERTED STREETS.

   RADIO STATIONS WERE ASKED TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK FROM WHERE THE
GOVERNMENT HAS URGED THE POPULATION TO REMAIN CALM. THE NETWORK IS
CARRYING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WHICH IS INTERRUPTED BY "NEWS BULLETINS"
READ BY ARMY SPOKESMEN.

   ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NINE PEOPLE WERE HURT, NEITHER THE
ARMY NOR THE GUERRILLAS HAVE ISSUED AN OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE POSSIBLE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THIS HAS BEEN THE GUERILLAS'
LARGEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ONE HAVING
THE MOST SERIOUS EFFECTS IN THE CAPITAL.

REPREHENSIBLE SITUATION CAUSED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] WHICH ONCE AGAIN IS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS UNJUSTIFIABLE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE
FMLN TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ACTION, WHICH IS NOT A MILITARY ACTION,
KNOWING THAT A PEACE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY.  THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT
GO....[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE ONES WHO
PAY MOST DEARLY FOR THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.  THIS IS PROVED
BY THE DEPLORABLE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY MORNING, WHEN TWO
SMALL CHILDREN -- 4- YEARS OLD AND 1- YEAR OLD -- DIED AS A RESULT OF
THE F M L N'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

   WE BELIEVE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THAT THE PEACE PROCESS IS
IRREVERSIBLE AND IT SHOULD OCCUR; AND IT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED -- NOT
ONLY BY YOU, AS PEOPLE WHO DEMAND PEACE AND TRANQUILITY, BUT ALSO BY
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THROUGHOUT THESE MONTHS.  YOU HAVE BEEN
THE BEST WITNESSES OF THE EFFORTS EXERTED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT AT THE
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND OF THE SUPPORT....[CORRECTS HIMSELF] THE
UNDENIABLE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM ALL THE NATIONS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF EL

WHO ARE PART OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE [AS HEARD], HAVE BEHAVED.  WE
CANNOT BUT STATE OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE MANY STATEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN
HEARING THROUGH THE NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH BEGAN LAST NIGHT,

 FORCES ARE A PROFESSIONAL CORPS; AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
PREPARED TO COUNTER ANY IRRATIONAL   FMLN ACTION -- EVEN THIS
ONE, WHICH IS ONLY BEING CARRIED OUT FOR PUBLICITY PURPOSES
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS
ISSUING FALSE STATEMENTS THROUGH A NETWORK THAT HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN RADIO SANDINO AND RADIO VENCEREMOS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, OUR ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION.  THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS THANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT AND
COOPERATION; AND THE TERRORISTS WILL BE FORCED TO GATHER IN
INCREASINGLY SMALLER PLACES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL
DEFINITELY CONTROL THE SITUATION IN A SHORT TIME.  HOWEVER, IT IS
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE RECEIVING YOUR SUPPORT.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT
WANT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ENDANGER THE LIFE OF EVEN ONE SINGLE
CIVILIAN; BUT THEY WILL SEE TO IT THAT THE TERRORISTS RECEIVE WHAT
THEY DESERVE ON THIS OCCASION, WHEN THEY HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH DAMAGE TO
THE POPULATION, ITSELF.

   WE BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO HEED THE CALL NOT TO GO OUT
ON TO THE STREETS; TO STAY AT HOME OR AT THE RESIDENCE IN WHICH YOU
ARE RIGHT NOW -- EVEN IF IT IS NOT YOUR OWN -- BECAUSE IT IS NOW A
MATTER OF TIME.  I REPEAT, WE DO NOT WANT ANY MORE CASUALTIES AS A

THIS.  THESE MEASURES ARE THE TOOLS THAT OUR STATE OF LAW OFFERS FOR
THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES TO PROTECT YOUR LIVES SO THAT WE WILL
NO LONGER HAVE TO REGRET INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ONES WE HAVE SEEN THE
PAST 2 DAYS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR ATTITUDE DESERVES OUR RECOGNITION AND THE

SUPPORTING US, THAT YOU CONTINUE TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT
EFFECTIVELY , WITHOUT ENDANGERING MORE CIVILIAN LIVES.  THROUGHOUT THE

NICARAGUA TO BE INDEPENDENT.

   WHO, THEN, WILL WE VOTE FOR ON 25 NOVEMBER?  [CROWD RESPONSE
UNMONITORABLE] WE MUST VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, AND WE MUST INVITE ALL
NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR NICARAGUA, EVEN IF THOSE NICARAGUANS ARE NOT
MEMBERS OF THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -], EVEN IF
THOSE NICARAGUANS WERE MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES, EVEN IF THOSE
NICARAGUANS WERE INVOLVED WITH SOMOZISM IN THE PAST.  IT IS A MATTER
OF VOTING FOR NICARAGUA, AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST POLICY; IT IS A
MATTER OF CHOOSING BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND THE IMPERIALIST POWER; AND
NICARAGUA IS REPRESENTED BY THE FSLN.  NO ONE MUST BE MISTAKEN ABOUT
THIS.  [APPLAUSE].

   THE FSLN IS THE ONLY FORCE THAT CAN GUARANTEE STABILITY FOR ALL THE
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SECTORS OF THIS COUNTRY: LARGE- SMALL- AND
MEDIUM-SCALE PRODUCERS, MERCHANTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, EVERYONE.  ONLY THE
FSLN CAN GUARANTEE THIS BECAUSE THE UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNITY] IS
SIMPLY A MESS OF PEOPLE, A BADLY MADE AND WRAPPED TAMALE.  THAT IS
WHAT UNO IS, AND NO ONE CAN EAT IT.  [APPLAUSE, SHOUTS]

   YOU LIKE BASEBALL, RIGHT?  YOU LIKE BASEBALL.  WHEN THE BATTER IS
UP, THE PITCHER THROWS AND THE BATTER HITS THE BALL, BUT THE BALL
VEERS LEFT, WHAT IS THAT?  [CROWD RESPONDS: FOUL TO THE LEFT].  IF HE
BATS AGAIN AND THE BALL GOES THE OTHER WAY, WHAT IS THAT?  [CROWD
RESPONDS: FOUL TO THE RIGHT].  AND HE HITS IT THROUGH THE CENTER, WAY
UP THERE ....  [CROWD RESPONDS: HOME RUN] IT IS A HOMERUN.  THEREFORE,
ONE SHOULD BAT NEITHER TO THE LEFT NOR TO THE RIGHT BUT THROUGH THE
CENTER; 25 IN THE FIFTH [AS HEARD].  YOU MUST HIT A HOME RUN, 25 IN
THE FIFTH.  THAT IS WHERE THE FSLN IS, IN THE FIFTH.  THAT IS WHERE
THE VOTE MUST BE CAST, AND THAT IS WHERE SILVIO MAYORGA AND ALL THE
PEOPLE OF NAGAROTE WILL CAST THEIR VOTES FOR THE FSLN ON 25 [FEBRUARY
1990].

CENTRAL AMERICAN, LATIN AMERICAN BROTHERS: YOU ARE LISTENING TO RADIO
VENCEREMOS, THE VOICE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH DETERMINATION
TO ATTAIN DEMOCRACY.  WE REPORT TO OUR FIGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
TUNE IN, TO ALL OUR PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAT THE FLMN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED MORE
THAN 18 HOURS OF HEROIC COMBAT IN SAN SALVADOR, THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
CITIES, AND IN THE HIGHWAYS.  AT THIS POINT, OUR MEN HAVE DOWNED TWO
HELICOPTERS AND DESTROYED THREE MORE HELICOPTERS THAT WERE ON LAND.
THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS TAKEN OUT OF COMBAT TO
FIVE.  WE HAVE ALSO DAMAGED TWO MORE ARMY ARMED VEHICLES AND THIS
BRINGS THE TOTAL TO HALF A DOZEN.  THESE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.
WE HAVE ALSO DESTROYED 12 LIGHT TANKS.  OUR PERSONNEL HAVE TAKEN
CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL MAYORS' OFFICES IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHTOUT
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY.  ALSO, IN SAN SALVADOR WE
HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL PRISONERS OF WAR.  THEY ARE PART OF THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AND THE BELLOSO BATTALION.  WE HAVE ALSO
CONFISCATED A LARGE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL FROM THE FASCISTS ENEMY
FORCES.  THESE WEAPONS ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE AND ARE NOW
GOING TO BE USED TO SHOOT THE FASCISTS.  THESE WEAPONS ARE IN THE
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO USE THEM TO ATTAIN JUSTICE FOR THE
MURDERS OF FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, OTHER COOPERATIVISTS, THE TEN
UNION LEADERS, AND MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO.  THESE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE ARE A GUARANTEE FOR JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   ATTENTION, ATTENTION, THIS IS LAST MINUTE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN
RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS.  ATTENTION SALVADORANS AND PRESS
AGENCIES THAT ARE MONITORING OUR GUERRILLA RADIO STATION.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT BOMBINGS CONTINUE IN SAN SALVADOR.
INDISCRMINATE BOMBING CONTINUES IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE RECEIVED
REPORTS OF INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING IN ZACAMIL, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN
MARCOS NEIGHBORHOODS.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THESE AREAS.  THESE
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DENSELY POPULATED.  WE ALSO RECEIVED THE REPORT THAT
A DEATH SQUAD HEADED BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES HAS AGAIN
TAKEN ACTIONS AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
UNABLE TO COMBAT OUR PERSONNEL.  THIS SQUAD ENTERED THE SALVADORAN
UNIVERSITY FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS LOCATED.
WE MUST NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS.  THEY CAPTURED 13 CIVILIANS, BLINDFOLDED, TIED, AND TOOK
THEM INTO THAT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS.  ELENA FUENTES -- THAT
REPUDIABLE MURDERER, THAT ASSASSIN GORRILLA -- COWARDLY ATTACKS THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HE IS UNABLE TO COMBAT THE PEOPLE'S ARMED
PERSONNEL.  FUENTES IS UNABLE TO STRIKE BACK SO HE ATTACKS MOTHERS AND
UNION MEMBERS.  THIS IS WHAT THIS TWO-BIT COLONEL IS ACCUSTOMED TO
DOING.  HE STRIKES OUT AT THE PEOPLE.  LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT THE
REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR.  OUR PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF DEATH
SQUADS, POVERTY, REPRESSION, AND FASCIST TOTALITARIANISM.  WE ARE
TOTALLY DECIDED AND FIRMLY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THE FASCIST
LATANDONA OFFICERS [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO
BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AS ONE STRONG FIST, LET
US ALL JOIN TOGETHER AND STRIKE THE FASCISTS.  LET'S TAKE IT TO THE
HILT.

VENCEREMOS NOW ANNOUNCES TO OUR PEOPLE, AS WELL AS TO THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WAR REPORT NO.  1 ON OUR NATIONAL MILITARY
MANUEVER.

   AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER [0200 GMT ON 12 NOVEMBER], THE
 FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT] LAUNCHED THE MILITARY -
POLITICAL PLAN DRAFTED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND CONSISTING OF A NATIONAL
MILITARY MANEUVER CALLED: "OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH
LIVES!"  THE PLAN BEGAN WITH AN ATTACK FROM AT LEAST 50 DIRECTIONS ON
THE ENEMY POSITIONS IN THE CITY OF SAN SALVADOR.  SINCE THAT TIME, OUR
UNITS HAVE BEEN WAGING FIERCE COMBAT WITH THE ENEMY FORCES, OCCUPYING
POSITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY THAT WE ARE STILL HOLDING.

   OTHER GROUPS LATER JOINED THE MANEUVER AND ATTACKED IN THE CITIES
OF SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, SANTA ANA, CHALATENANGO, AND
THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  THERE WERE ALSO DOZENS OF ATTACKS
AGAINST POSITIONS IN TOWNS AND HIGHWAYS OF THE COUNTRY.

   AFTER 18 HOURS OF COMBAT, THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ESTIMATED RESULTS:
OVER 400 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES, INCLUDING KILLED AND WOUNDED;
12 ARMORED VEHICLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED; 3 HELICOPTERS AND 1 OR 2
SMALL SMALL AIRPLANES WERE DESTROYED ON THE GROUND; AND 2 HELICOPTERS
WERE DOWNED; TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CARTRIDGES, OVER 50 RIFLES,
MACHINEGUNS, AND OTHER TYPES OF WEAPONS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

   THESE RESULTS GREATLY EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS MANEUVER DUE
TO THE IMPACT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIGHTING.  OUR FIGHTERS HAVE
FULFILLED THIS PART OF THE PLAN IN A DARING, COURAGEOUS, AND EFFECTIVE
MANNER, PROVING THEIR HIGH COMBAT MORALE.  NOW THEY MUST HOLD THE
POSITIONS THEY HAVE TAKEN, THUS GUARANTEEING THAT THE GOALS OF THE
PLAN ARE ACHIEVED.

   WE DENOUNCE THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE.
WE CALL ON THE PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE BOMBING.  TO DO
THIS, THE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM OUR
FIGHTERS.  WE ALSO CALL ON THE COUNTRY'S CIVILIAN POPULATION TO JOIN
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE COMBAT OR ARE HELPING OUR FORCES.
WE CALL ON THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS FORCED TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN
PEOPLE TO SUSPEND THE BOMBING, TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT A GENOCIDAL
ACTION, AND TO DESERT AND JOIN OUR FORCES.  WE URGE INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND RELIEF GROUPS TO HELP PROTECT CIVILIANS
WHO ARE BEING HARASSED BY THE ARMY OR WHO ARE IN ANY OTHER EMERGENCY
SITUATION.

   OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!  FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ LIVES!

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES, COMMANDER OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, TODAY
REFUTED THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION THAT HIS BRIGADE HAS DEATH SQUADS AND CLANDESTINE JAILS.

   THE CHARGE, WHICH WAS RAISED ON 13 OCTOBER BY THE NONGOVERNMENTAL
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, LINKS THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE WITH THE DEATH
SQUADS.  THE COMMISSION PRESENTED THE TESTIMONY OF CESAR VIELMAN JOYA
MARTINEZ, A FORMER SOLDIER IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, WHO DESCRIBED
IN A VIDEO REPORT FILMED IN MEXICO HOW THE CLANDESTINE STRUCTURES IN
THAT MILITARY GARRISON OPERATE.  ACCORDING TO JOYA, THESE CLANDESTINE
STRUCTURES ARE DIRECTED BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS WHO KIDNAP, MURDER
AND CAUSE THE DISAPPERANCE OF LABOR UNION MEMBERS.  AFTER DENYING ALL
CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND HIS GARRISON, COL ELENA SAID THAT JOYA INDEED
SERVED IN THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE; THAT HE DESERTED WHEN HE WAS
PLACED UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OVERRIDING HIS AUTHORITY; AND THAT IT
WAS PROVED LATER THAT ON 5 JULY, AT TRES CEIBAS CANTON, IN APOPA, HE
MURDERED A PEASANT AND TORTURED ANOTHER ONE WHO DIED LATER AT ROSALES
HOSPITAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ELENA] THIS MAN IS A MURDERER, DESERTER, AND
THIEF.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY HE
COMMITTED AT THE 1ST BRIGADE, WE PLACED HIM UNDER INVESTIGATION.  HE
FLED FROM THE GARRISON WHEN HE REALIZED THAT THE HIGH COMMAND HAD
ORDERED THE INVESTIGATION.

   I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE IS NO GROUP OF DEATH SQUADS AS WAS
STATED IN A CERTAIN NEWSCAST BECAUSE WE ARE PROFESSIONALS AND DO NOT
HAVE THESE KINDS OF FORCES, WHICH WE MIGHT CALL OBSCURE.  WE ACT
ACCORDING TO LAW.  THIS IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.

   I ALSO WISH TO STATE THAT I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS A RECORD THAT WAS
BUILT SINCE THE FIRST DAY THIS INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THE ABUSES OF
AUTHORITY.  HE WAS TAKEN TO AN OPERATION IN THE NEJAPA AREA WHERE HE
CAPTURED EIGHT PEOPLE AND MURDERED ONE.  HE THEN TOOK THEM TO THE 1ST
BRIGADE AND ONE OF THEM WAS SEVERLY BEATEN.  [END RECORDING]

   THE NATIONAL GUARD IS IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING THESE MURDERS AND
THE CASE IS AT THE 1ST PEACE COURT, ACCORDING TO COL ELENA.  THE
DESERTER WAS RECRUITED DURING FEBRUARY 1989, COMMITTED THE MURDERS ON
5 JULY, AND DESERTED FROM THE 1ST BRIGADE IN AUGUST.  BASED ON THE
VIDEO REPORT, HE MAY BE LIVING IN MEXICO, FROM WHICH -- IT WAS HINTED
-- THE FORMER SOLDIER'S EXTRADITION MAY BE REQUESTED.

   FINALLY, COL ELENA DENIED THAT ANY CLANDESTINE JAILS HAVE EVER
EXISTED IN HIS MILITARY GARRISON.  HE ALSO DENIED THAT A FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] WOMAN LEADER BY THE
LAST NAME OF CHAN CHANG IS BEING HELD PRISONER THERE.

ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN MIGUEL, OUR REBEL ARMY CONFISCATED THREE
22-MM RIFLES, TWO .38-CAL PISTOLS, ONE 22-MM PISTOL, AND ONE CZECH
PISTOL.  ON 6TH EAST STREET OF THE CITY, AN ENEMY OFFICER AND A
SERGEANT WERE KILLED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED.  WE REPEAT, TWO
SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED AT 6TH EAST STREET IN SAN MIGUEL.  ONE OF THE
SOLDIERS SURRENDERED TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE WAS WOUNDED.  THERE IS A
MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND OUR GUERRILLA ARMY.  WHEN
FASCIST TROOPS CAPTURE WOUNDED REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR, THEY QUESTION
THEM FIRST AT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS
AND THEN MURDER THEM.  OUR ARMY RESPECTS THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.

   WE CONTINUE OUR SAN MIGUEL REPORTING.  AT 1030 TODAY, WE DESTROYED
A LIGHT TANK ON 6TH NORTH AVENUE THEREBY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF
LIGHT TANKS THAT WE HAVE DESTROYED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  OTHER
REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATE THAT THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IN ZACATECOLUCA AS OF 1618, IS 45,
INCLUDING TWO SECTION CHIEFS.  HEAVY FIGHTING CONTINUES IN
ZACATECOLUCA NEIBORHOODS.  IN SOYAPANGO, WHERE WE HAD RECEIVED A
REPORT OF 50 CASUALTIES, WE HAVE NOW BEEN INFORMED THAT THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY HAS INCREASED TO 70.  WE HAVE
INFLICTED 70 CASUALTIES ON AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL
BUSTILLO'S CRIMINAL AIR FORCE.  THIS NUMBER INCLUDES AN OFFICER.  WE
HAVE INFLICTED 10 CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE FORCES. WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT 3 HELICOPTERS WERE DAMAGED IN SOYAPANGO WHERE
CLASHES HAVE ENSUED AND CONTINUE AT 1619.  REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR
AND SAN MIGUEL INDICATE THAT AT THIS TIME CLASHES ARE INCREASING IN
INTENSITY IN BOTH PLACES.  A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE RECEIVED A REPORT
FROM SAN MIGUEL THAT OUR COMRADES WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND FORCING THE
3D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS TO WITHDRAW.

UNHARMED.

   ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, URBAN GUERRILLA MEMBERS ENTERED THE
RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) LEADER'S RESIDENCE
WHERE SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED, BUT THERE ARE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON
THE CASUALTIES.

   THE RESIDENCE IS LOCATED IN CAMPESTRE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] GOOD AFTERNOON, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  ON 19
MARCH, OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO
DEMANDED POLITICAL STABILITY, PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AS WELL AS
JUDICIAL AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE IRRATIONAL ACTIONS
THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS
UNLEASHED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PARTICULARLY AS OF YESTERDAY, MAKE
IT NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION, TO
TAKE FIRM ACTION WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF OUR COUNTRY.

   WE MUST ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE OF 19 MARCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT
MUST NOW RESPOND WITH FIRM ACTION, WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  WE
MUST RESPOND BECAUSE THE FMLN IS ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION --
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE -- IN A BRUTAL AND SAVAGE MANNER.  THE ARMED
FORCES OF EL SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AND THEY HAVE
CONTROLLED THE SITUATION.

   HOWEVER, THESE FMLN TERRORISTS, WHO ALREADY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN
DEFEATED BY THE ARMED FORCES, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CARRY OUT
INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THEY ARE EVEN GOING AS FAR AS
ENTERING INNOCENT HOMES TO PRESSURE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE
THROUGH THESE HARSH TIMES THAT ALL SALVADORANS HAVE EXPERIENCED.

   THAT IS WHY WE MUST ACT FIRMLY BUT WITHIN THE LAW.  TO THIS EFFECT,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET AT 1400 IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE TO TRY TO SOLVE SOMETHING WE ARE COMPLETELY SURE IS
WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT.  WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE
MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, WE RECALLED ARTICLE 2 OF OUR CONSTITUTION,
WHICH SAYS: ALL PERSONS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE, PHYSICAL AND MORAL
INTEGRITY, FREEDOM, SECURITY, WORK, PROPERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO BE
PROTECTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES AND POSSESSIONS DEFENDED.

   THAT IS WHY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THIS AFTERNOON MADE A
DECISION, BASED ON THE LEGAL MECHANISMS GRANTED TO IT BY THE
CONSTITUTION.  FIRST, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I WILL READ ARTICLE 29 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:

   ARTICLE 29.  IN CASES OF WAR, INVASION OF THE TERRITORY, REBELLION,
SEDITION, CATASTROPHE, EPIDEMIC, OR OTHER GENERAL CALAMITY, OR IN
CASES OF GRAVE DISRUPTION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, THE GUARANTEES
ESTALISHED IN ARTICLES 5, ARTICLE 6, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, ARTICLE 7,
SUBPARAGRAPH 1, AND ARTICLE 24 CAN BE SUSPENDED, EXCEPT WHEN REFERRING
TO MEETINGS OR GROUPS FOR RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND SPORTS
PURPOSES.  THE SUSPENSION CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OR PART OF IT
AND WILL BE DONE THROUGH A DECREE ISSUED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, AND IN ARTICLE 13, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, OF THE
CONSTITUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED, WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO DECIDES
BY A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTED DEPUTIES, BUT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION DETENCION ADMINISTRATIVA SHOULD NOT BE
LONGER THAN 15 DAYS.

   THE SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL NOT EXCEED 30
DAYS.  ONCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUSPENSION CAN BE EXTENDED FOR A
SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME, THROUGH A NEW DECREE, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT LED TO IT CONTINUE.  IF THAT DECREE IS NOT ISSUED, THE SUSPENDED
GUARANTEES WILL BE FULLY RESTORED.

   AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE
BRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR
THAT PURPOSE WE ACT BASED ON ARTICLE 167, NO.  6, WHICH READS: IT IS
UP TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO SUSPEND AND RESTORE THE
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THIS CONSTITUTION
IF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION.  [CONTINUED]

A MEASURE AND THE ACTIONS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN REGARD TO THE MEASURE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JUDICIAL NORMS STATED IN
OUR CONSTITUTION, TODAY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAS DECIDED TO
DECLARE A STATE OF SEIGE AS A MEASURE TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, WHO ARE BEING UNJUSTLY ATTACKED BY THE IRRATIONALITY AND
SAVAGERY OF THE FMLN'S TERRORISM, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC
CANNOT AND MUST NOT ALLOW.  TOMORROW WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING IN WHICH THE
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TODAY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS STATED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC.

   IN THIS REGARD, WE WISH TO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE POLITICAL
PARTIES.  THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO REMAIN DOUBTFUL.  NOW IS THE TIME
FOR ALL THOSE WHO INTEND TO WORK WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO STATE
-- IN A CATEGORICAL MANNER -- THAT THEY ABIDE BY AND SUPPORT THE
REPUBLIC'S INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO
WORK AND PEACEFULLY WAGE A STRUGGLE TO ATTAIN POWER.  WE CAN NO LONGER
ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN IS OR IS
NOT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THE RIGHTS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE
DEMANDED TIME AND AGAIN IN A DEMOCRATIC WAY.

   WE ALSO URGE THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS TO TELL THEIR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES
AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THE FMLN AND HOW IT WANTS TO
SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THEY MUST ALSO LISTEN AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR WHAT HE HAS
BEEN SAYING THESE DAYS.  HE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN
TRYING TO CONFUSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY SAYING THAT IN EL
SALVADOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.
HOWEVER, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN PLANTING BOMBS,
AND SO FAR 8 CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 100 HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THAT INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM.

   IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN ORTEGA AND MAKE HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR
SENDING THE WEAPONS USED TO KILL AND TO BLEED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO
DEATH.  HE SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THESE ACTIONS WHILE
TRYING TO HIDE THEM AND TO DECEIVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   IT IS ALSO TIME TO OPENLY CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR ITS IRRATIONAL
ACTIONS.  EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SINCE THE 1ST DAY OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OFFERED TO BEGIN A
DIALOGUE PROCESS.  IT OFFERED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH RATIONAL
AND PEACEFUL MEANS, SINCE THAT IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANTED
AND THAT IS WHAT THEY DEMANDED ON 19 MARCH ELECTION DAY.

   WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW THE FMLN LEADERS TO TRAVEL FREELY THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISINFORM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
WHICH INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF DISINFORMATION SHOULD
CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   WE ARE NOT ISSUING THIS CALL TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON BEHALF OF
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE ARE MAKING THIS CALL ON BEHALF OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAVAGERY OF INDISCRIMINATE
TERRORISM.  WE ISSUE THIS CALL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AND WE ARE CONVINCED
THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE THIS FATE.  THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ATTACKED WITH TERRORIST BOMBS. THEY SHOULD
NOT BE FACING THE THREATS THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD DURING THESE LONG 10 YEARS THAT
THEY WANT PEACE, DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNDER
SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE IN HISTORY, THAT ARE NO LONGER
JUSTIFIED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME WHEN THE WORLD IS EVOLVING TOWARD
PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE, WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CONDEMN THE FMLN'S
IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.

   WE ALSO WANT TO TELL THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE SUPPORTING
THEIR PEOPLE AND WILL NEVER PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO LEAD TO
ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT MOVEMENT THAT HAS TAINTED
OUR HISTORY.  WE WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN
EL SALVADOR IS THROUGH REASONING AND PEACEFUL MEANS AND THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO ACHIEVE PEACE AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK: THROUGH REASONING AND
PEACEFUL MEANS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAIN WE URGE YOU TO REMAIN CALM. THE ARMED
FORCES ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.  WE WILL SOON LIVE NORMAL LIVES
AGAIN.  HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME WE ASK ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THE PEACE
PROCESS, TO JOIN FORCES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THE FMLN SHOULD
FEEL THE PEOPLE'S PRESSURE AGAINST ITS IRRATIONAL ACTIONS.

   WE ARE SURE THAT WITH YOU -- THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES,
AND GOVERNMENT -- WE WILL ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  GOD BLESS YOU
ALL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES INFORM THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR THAT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOTING AND
ACTS OF VANDALISM IN AREAS AROUND SAN SALVADOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO FACE THE ARMY, WHICH DISMANTLED ITS PLAN TO CREATE A STATE
OF REBELLION.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, GROUPS OF VANDALS HAVE SACKED SOME SHOPPING
CENTERS, SPECIFICALLY IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENT, AS PART
OF THEIR STRATEGY TO COVER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FMLN TERRORISTS.

   IN THIS RESPECT, THE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS ARE COMMITTED TO
RIDDING THE ZONE OF THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS WHO SEEK INTERNATIONAL
PUBLICITY FOR THEIR CAUSE.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST BE ASSURED THAT
THEIR ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONDING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER TO THE
TERRORISTS' PROVOCATION, SINCE THE SOLDIERS DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF
THE PEOPLE AND SOCIETY.  FOR THAT REASON, PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM.
THE ARMED FORCES REITERATE THEIR CALL ON PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES
SO THEY WILL NOT FALL PREY TO FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS AND TO HEED THE

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 12 NOV (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS) TODAY ACCUSED ITS COUNTRY'S ARMY
OF "UNLEASHING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY DROPPING
ROCKETS AND BOMBS FROM SALVADORAN AIR FORCE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS
AND LEAVING A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS."

   IN A COMMUNIQUE DELIVERED TO MEXICAN NEWS AGENCY "NOTIMEX,"
FENASTRAS CALLED ON "INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMANITARIAN
GROUPS TO DECLARE THE PLACES ATTACKED BY THE ARMY ZONES UNDER
PROTECTION TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED."

   MEMBERS OF THE ARMY AND THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT HAVE
CALLED FENASTRAS A FRONT ORGANIZATION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, (FMLN).

   ON 31 OCTOBER, TERRORISTS ATTACKED THE FENASTRAS BUILDING IN SAN
SALVADOR KILLING SEVERAL UNION LEADERS AND DESTROYING THE BUILDING.
FENASTRAS MEMBERS IN MEXICO HAVE ACCUSED DEATH SQUADS RUN BY THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES THROUGH THE NATIONAL INFORMATION DEPARTMENT OF
THE ATTACK. ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES.


DEV-MUC3-0709 (U NEBRASKA)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 13 NOV 89 (MOSCOW TASS) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO
REPORTS, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DECLARED A STATE OF
SIEGE IN THE COUNTRY ON SUNDAY.  A CURFEW WAS INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT EL
SALVADOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ABROGATED
AT 8 P.M.  ON SUNDAY.

   THESE MEASURES ARE EXPECTED TO STOP THE LARGE-SCALE REBEL
OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON SATURDAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   OVER THE FIRST EIGHT HOURS OF COMBAT MORE THAN 400 SOLDIERS AND
OFFICERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED, AND SIX
HELICOPTERS, ONE PLANE AND TENS OF MOTOR-VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED, THE
VANCEREMOS RADIO STATION REPORTED.

   UNITS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ARE
MAINTAINING POSITIONS IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR, USULUTAN,
SACATECOLUQUE AND OTHER STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TOWNS.

   RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR SUPPORT THE REBELS DESPITE THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE BOMBING RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  


DEV-MUC3-0710 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] FIGHTING HAS
CONTINUED IN SAN MIGUEL.  FORCES FROM THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE HAVE
BEEN DISLODGED FROM THE URBINA BRIDGE AND MANY CASUALTIES WERE
INFLICTED ON THEM THERE.

   IN ADDITION, AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, A HELICOPTER WAS HIT AT THE
15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.  IT WAS SHOT DOWN BY OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT
FIRE AT THE 15 SEPTEMBER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN SAN MIGUEL AND FELL ON THE
PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY.  LATER, ANOTHER HELICOPTER WAS DAMAGED IN SAN
MIGUEL, WHERE HELICOPTER PILOTS DO NOT WANT TO LAND BECAUSE THEY ARE
AFRAID OF OUR ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NATIONAL POLICE POSITIONS IN NUEVA CONCEPCION,
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, HAVE BEEN ATTACKED.  AT 0645, FIGHTING
CONTINUES.  THE MESS HALL, THE AMMUNITION WAREHOUSE, AND THE TRAINING
FIELD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  THE GARRISON OF THE NATIONAL POLICE HAS
SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.

   FURTHER FIGHTING WAS REPORTED AT 0646 IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ
DEPARTMENT.  OUR COMRADES IN ZACATECOLUCA REPORT THAT THE FIGHTING IS
HEAVY.  WE URGE THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE TO OBTAIN WATER AND FOOD.  WE URGE
THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY.

   REPORTS ARE THAT THERE IS FIGHTING AT THIS MOMENT IN THE MONTSERRAT
DISTRICT, NEAR CUSCATLAN STADIUM IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE CAPITAL HAS NO
POWER AND WATER IS BECOMING SCARCE.

   WITH REGARD TO ELECTRICAL POWER, THE SITUATION IS THE SAME THROUGHOUT
THE NATION'S TERRITORY.  IN A NUTSHELL, THE HIGH COMMAND HAS COMPLETELY
LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY IN MOST OF EL
SALVADOR'S TERRITORY AND THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT IS 100
PERCENT PARALYZED.  FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN DEPARTMENT CAPITALS AT
THIS MOMENT, WHILE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL FOR 30
CONSECUTIVE HOURS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR NOW.  OUR
COMRADES' COMMAND ECHELONS, WHO ARE COMMUNICATING WITH US FROM THE
CAPITAL'S DISTRICTS, ARE TELLING US THAT YOUTHS ARE MASSIVELY JOINING THE
FORTIFICATION WORK -- DIGGING DITCHES, CARRYING FOOD AND AMMUNITION, AND
HANDLING LIGHT ARTILLERY PIECES AND MACHINEGUNS; IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THAT
IS NECESSARY TO FIGHT INSIDE THE CITIES AND IN THE SUBURBS.  THEIR
INCORPORATION IN ALL CITIES IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR.

   FOR THIS REASON, WE CALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE IN ALL DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS
TO LOOK FOR OUR FORCES, TO LOOK FOR OUR COMRADES, TO ORGANIZE IN EACH
DISTRICT AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THE BRIGADES THAT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF
THE FOOD SUPPLY, TO DIG MORE DITCHES, TO BUILD ANTIAIRCRAFT SHELTERS, AND
TO SUPPLY INFORMATION, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AT THIS MOMENT.  WE
MUST ORGANIZE THE INFORMATION NETWORK.  WE MUST HAVE VIGILANCE IN EVERY
CORNER IN EVERY DISTRICT AND NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT EARLY TODAY THE ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT A
NUMBER OF SEARCHES AND ARRESTS IN THE CAPITAL.  WELL, WE CALL ON THE
POPULATION TO ORGANIZE AGAINST THE SEARCHES AND ARRESTS. ESTABLISH
VIGILANCE.  DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY ANYBODY.  ARM YOURSELVES -- TAKE OUT
YOUR PISTOLS, MAKE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WITH BOTTLES AND GASOLINE -- IN OTHER
WORDS, DEFEND YOURSELVES.

   AT 0704, IT WAS REPORTED TO US FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT FIGHTING IS
TAKING PLACE IN EL CARMEN AGAINST THE NATIONAL POLICE.  A NEW PLACE HAS
BEEN ADDED TO THOSE IN WHICH MILITARY ACTIVITY IS TAKING PLACE.

   MEANWHILE, OTHER REPORTS INDICATE THAT FMLN SNIPERS ARE HARASSING THE
ARMY'S MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL.  THE REPORT SAYS THAT
OUR SNIPERS POSTED IN THE TALLEST BUILDINGS ARE EFFECTIVELY KEEPING THE
ARMY PATROLS AND MOVEMENTS AT BAY.  THE ARMY IS BEGINNING TO HAVE TROUBLE
EVACUATING ITS WOUNDED, BECAUSE IN THE CAPITAL EPISODES ARE NOW TAKING
PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN ONLY SEEN IN MORAZAN BEFORE; THAT IS, HELICOPTERS
FLYING IN TO PICK UP THE WOUNDED, AS THEY DID IN THE VALLEYS AND THE
PLAINS.  THIS IS HAPPENING NOW IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ARMY TROOPS
CANNOT ADVANCE INTO CERTAIN AREAS TO PICK UP THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED, WHO
ARE VERY, VERY NUMEROUS.  THE HELICOPTERS NOW HAVE TO LAND IN SOCCER
FIELDS AND IN OTHER PLACES TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED.  SUCH IS THE SITUATION
IN SAN SALVADOR.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, FIGHTING CONTINUES IN
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CAPITAL, WHERE THERE ARE FMLN-CONTROLLED AREAS.


DEV-MUC3-0711 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN
EYEWITNESSES, SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS BOMBED THE UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE.

   THE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
CAPTURED AND BLINDFOLDED 10 UNIVERSITY GUARDS YESTERDAY AND THEN TOOK THEM
OFF THE CAMPUS.

   ACCORDING TO THESE EYEWITNESSES, ARMY TROOPS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY OF
EL SALVADOR USING AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND A 105-MM CANNON.  THEY SAID THAT
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS BOMBED LATER ON.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL SOURCES
HAVE NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR DENIED THIS REPORT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE UNIVERSITY
OF EL SALVADOR OF BEING A GUERRILLA "SANCTUARY" AND HAVE SAID THAT THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED FROM THE CAMPUS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT 10 UNIVERSITY "GUARDS" WERE
CAPTURED ON CAMPUS, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, ONE OF
THE GARRISONS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REBEL
OFFENSIVE BEGUN ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS SEIZED PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE
ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS INCLUDED AN ATTACK ON THE HOMES OF IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THAT OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT, THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE NATIONAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN ZACAMIL, ONE OF THE MOST POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS MILITARY POSITIONS IN A DOZEN
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THIS CAPITAL. THE
FIGHTING THEN SPREAD TO SANTA ANA, CABANAS, LA PAZ, SAN VICENTE, SAN
MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH, CENTRAL, AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES --
APPROXIMATELY 300 ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND 400 ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS.  THIS COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AND
A CURFEW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.


DEV-MUC3-0712 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS IS A LAST
MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL.  ATTENTION, OUR PEOPLE, AND ALSO OTHER
FRATERNAL PEOPLES WHO ARE LISTENING TO US IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE
WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA.  ATTENTION.  AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS
ARE NOW BOMBING AND FIRING ROCKETS AT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.

   A HELICOPTER IS BOMBING A STRETCH OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY NEAR
CIUDAD DELGADO, AND THERE ARE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF THIS
CRIMINAL ACTION BY THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE.  AT 0933 TODAY A HELICOPTER
BOMBED HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS IN CIUDAD DELGADO.  

   AT 0900, MORE THAN 30 MINUTES AGO, A C-47 PLANE FITTED WITH
.50-CALIBER MACHINEGUNS STRAFED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS.  MEANWHILE, AN
A-37 PLANE, WHICH IS A FIGHTER-BOMBER PLANE KNOWN AS DRAGONFLY, FITTED

BOMBS OF 200, 500, AND EVEN 750 POUNDS, ALONG WITH A PUSH- PULL PLANE,
ALSO FITTED WITH ROCKETS, BOMBED THE AREA NEAR THE MARIONA JAIL TO THE
NORTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   WE ARE DENOUNCING THESE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF THE FASCIST REGIME HEADED
BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSION IN THE CAPITAL.  THESE
BOMBINGS ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN SAN SALVADOR.  IN PREVIOUS YEARS, WE HAVE
DENOUNCED BOMBINGS IN RURAL AREAS.  THE AERIAL DEATH SQUAD, HEADED BY THE
GENOCIDAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLOS SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, HAS CAUSED HUNDREDS
OF DEATHS, INCLUDING MUTILATIONS AND INJURIES.

   NOW, BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND DIPLOMATS
ACCREDITED IN SAN SALVADOR, AND A MILLION INHABITANTS IN THE CAPITAL, THE
AIR FORCE IS BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CAPITAL.  WE ARE TOLD THAT
A HELICOPTER HAS BEEN BOMBING THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN CIUDAD
DELGADO.  THESE HELICOPTERS FITTED WITH ROCKETS ARE KNOWN AS UH-1H.  THEY
HAVE BEEN MODIFIED AND ARE FITTED WITH 7.62-MM MACHINEGUNS AND
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.  THIS U.S.-MADE HELICOPTER HAS BEEN DROPPING
ROCKETS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY IN CIUDAD DELGADO.

   IN SUM, A C-47 PLANE MACHINEGUNNED DOWNTOWN MEJICANOS, AND AN A- 37
PLANE AND A PUSH-AND-PULL PLANE, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS 0-2 PLANE, BOMBED
THE MARIONA AREA.  

   A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL AT 1541 GMT:  OUR FORCES CONTINUE
TO ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  FMLN UNITS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF A PART OF
THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, THE TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE OLIGARCHY
WITH THE MOST WELL-KNOWN SURNAMES LIVES, A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE MOST
LUXURIOUS MANSIONS AND THE LATEST MODEL CARS.  OUR MEN HAVE TAKEN UP
POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, EXACTLY ATOP THE SAN SALVADOR
ARCHBISHOPRIC.  OUR MEN REPORTED THAT AT 1530 THEY TOOK CONTROL OF A PART
OF THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CAPITAL.  THEY ARE
ALSO MOVING IN TO TAKE UP POSITIONS AT THE PABLO ARNOLDO GUZMAN NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE IN MEJICANOS.  POSITIONS HAVE BECOME CONSOLIDATED
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY, AND CLASHES CONTINUE AROUND THE NATIONAL
POLICE GARRISONS IN ZACAMIL AND CUSCATANCINGO.

ARIAS, NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE, TO CONTACT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
AND THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE FASCIST ARMED FORCES TO PRESSURE THEM TO
STOP THEIR BOMBINGS.

   INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT THESE BOMBINGS
ARE TAKING PLACE IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.  WE LEARNED
THAT VIDEO REPORTS ARE ALREADY GOING AROUND THE WORLD SHOWING IMAGES OF
THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE BOMBINGS DESTROYED SOME BUILDINGS THERE AND
SOME HOUSES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CAPITAL.  THERE ARE DOZENS OF CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES.

   THERE WERE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS THIS MORNING IN SAN MIGUEL'S
ESMERALDA NEIGHORHOOD AND IN OTHER NEIGHORHOODS.  AT ABOUT 0900, A PLANE
DROPPED A BOMB THAT HIT A CIVILIAN HOME IN SAN MIGUEL.  A 12- YEAR-OLD
GIRL WAS INJURED IN SOYAPANGO.

   WE CALL ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE OAS TO
PRESSURE THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT TO STOP ITS BOMBINGS AGAINST THE PEOPLE,
TO STOP THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.

BE REGAINED.  THIS IS A PROMISE WE ARE MAKING, AND WE WILL KEEP IT SO
THAT YOU WILL REALLY HAVE THAT TRANQUILITY YOU NEED.  HOWEVER, I MUST
ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON THE STREET TO PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING
THIS.  IF YOU ARE OUT ON THE STREET, PLEASE DO NOT RUN IF YOU SEE
SOLDIERS.  WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  YOU WILL NOT HAVE
TROUBLE.  WE DO NOT USE VIOLENCE.  WE USE MILITARY CONTROL TECHNIQUES.
WE DO NOT USE IRRATIONAL TERROR.  WE USE STRICTLY MILITARY TECHNIQUES
AND TACTICS.

   WE ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM GOING OUT IN THE NEXT 8 HOURS, OR AT LEAST
STAY OFF THE STREETS.  IF YOU MUST GO OUT, DO IT, BUT WALK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET.  DO NOT RUN, AND DO NOT FEAR THE AUTHORITIES.  THE
AUTHORITIES ARE THERE TO PROTECT YOUR SAFETY WHICH IS BEING AFFECTED.  THE
AUTHORITIES WISH TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR TRANQUILITY.  I WANT YOU TO REST
ASSURED THAT WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.  BEFORE A MARXIST-LENINIST PLAN TAKES
OVER ONE OF OUR CITIES OR TOWNS, THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK OVER THE BODIES OF
EACH AND EVERY SOLDIER. THE SOLDIERS ARE WILLING TO DEFEND EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU.

   THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.  I JUST WANTED TO SEND YOU THIS
MESSAGE OF FAITH, HOPE, AND TRUST IN YOUR GOVERNMENT AND YOUR
INSTITUTION.  THAT IS ESSENTIAL.  WE MUST NOT YIELD WHEN CONFRONTED BY
MARXIST OR COMMUNIST PLANS.  OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR ARMED FORCES NEED YOUR
SUPPORT TODAY MORE THAN EVER.  SUPPORT OUR STRUGGLE IN DEFENSE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  REST ASSURED THAT ALONG THIS PATH THERE IS NO RETURN.
WE EITHER ACHIEVE OUR FINAL GOAL OF CONSOLIDATION, OR WE FALL ALONG THE
PATH.  WE MUST GIVE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC
HOMELAND.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I WILL BE MORE THAN GLAD TO ANSWER
THEM; HOWEVER, THIS WAS THE MESSAGE I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH YOU.

TELEVISION NEWSMAN EPIGMENIO IBARRA WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED BY A POWERFUL
BOMB TODAY, BUT IBARRA WAS NOT HURT.  

   IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHO PLACED THE BOMB IN THE VEHICLE WHILE IBARRA WAS
AWAY.

   THE BOMB IN IBARRA'S VEHICLE EXPLODED TODAY IN AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR
WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS IS CURRENTLY
UNDER WAY.  ON SATURDAY THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THE MOST POWERFUL
OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST 8 YEARS.

   THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS CONTINUES TODAY
FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY, AND THERE HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 400
CASUALTIES INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS.

   TODAY, MONDAY, SAN SALVADOR IS PRACTICALLY AT A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE
FIGHTING AND THE "TRANSPORTATION STRIKE" CALLED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WHICH ON SATURDAY LAUNCHED ITS LARGEST MILITARY
OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES, 127 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 240
WOUNDED SINCE THE FIGHTING BEGAN.  FOR THEIR PART, THE GUERRILLAS CLAIM
THAT THEY HAVE INFLICTED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY, BUT HAVE
PROVIDED NO FIGURES ON LOSSES OR ON THE DEAD AND INJURED AMONG ITS RANKS.


DEV-MUC3-0717 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMED
FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) HAS REPORTED THAT, IN ADDITION TO 30 DEAD
CIVILIANS, MORE THAN 200 SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
FIERCE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT NIGHT SINCE 11 NOVEMBER IN THE
CAPITAL AND SEVERAL KEY SALVADORAN CITIES.  

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN 300 WOUNDED CIVILIANS
AND MILITARY MEN.

   COPREFA STATED THAT 127 GUERRILLAS AND ABOUT 50 ARMY TROOPS WERE
REPORTED DEAD EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT THE FIGURES ARE GROWING BECAUSE
STRONG FIGHTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NORTHERN AREA OF THE
CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN AREA.

   THE ROSALES HOSPITAL, THE MAIN ONE IN THE CAPITAL, WAS ASSISTING MORE
THAN 100 CIVILIANS WOUNDED IN THE INTENSE CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE
SINCE 11 NOVEMBER WHILE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES ARE CALLING ON DOCTORS AND
NURSES TO HELP THE WOUNDED.

   ANOTHER 100 WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY HOSPITAL AND
ABOUT 100 MORE WERE TAKEN TO OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE CAPITAL AND
COUNTRYSIDE.

   MEANWHILE, THE SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, 56 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) GUERRILLAS THIS MORNING.  FIGHTING INTENSIFIED IN THE IMMEDIATE
AREA THIS MORNING.

   THERE WAS FIERCE FIGHTING IN ZACATECOLUCA TODAY AND ACCORDING TO PRESS
REPORTS, 13 BODIES WERE SEEN ON THE STREETS; EIGHT GUERRILLAS, FOUR
SOLDIERS, AND A CIVILIAN.

   THE GUERRILLAS, WHO, CARRYING AK-47 RIFLES AND PISTOLS, HAVE ASKED FOR
WATER AND FOOD IN SOME HOUSES, HAVE OCCUPIED FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN
MIGUEL, THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY, 140 KM FROM THE
CAPITAL.  SAN MIGUEL AND ZACATECOLUCA HAVE NO ELECTRICITY OR WATER TODAY.

   ACCORDING TO GUERRILLA SOURCES, SAN VICENTE AND USULUTAN, IN THE
COUNTRY'S EAST-CENTRAL AREA, WERE SITES OF FIERCE FIGHTING THIS MORNING.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] THIS IS A LAST
MINUTE REPORT BROUGHT TO YOU THROUGH THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
NETWORK, RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI AND RADIO VENCEREMOS IN NETWORK
BROADCASTING TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  THIS LAST MINUTE REPORT STATES
THAT THE AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED AND STRAFED THE AREA ACROSS FROM THE
INCA FACTORY AND PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO.  AS A RESULT OF THIS
BOMBING AND STRAFING ACTION 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 12 INJURED.
IN PRADOS DE VENECIA HOUSES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED.

   ATTENTION, WE CALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE ATTENTION OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS.  THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AS A RESULT OF THE
BOMBINGS IN SAN SALVADOR IS INCREASING.  ACROSS FROM THE INCA FACTORY AND
PRADOS DE VENECIA IN SOYAPANGO, THE AIR FORCE IS INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING
AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  ATTENTION, THE REPORT WE HAVE
RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR ADVISES US THAT 3 PERSONS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND
12 INJURED AND HOUSES DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A RESULT OF THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING BY THE AIR FORCE.  

   THE GENOCIDAL AND COWARDLY ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE, BOMBING AREAS
JUST LIKE ANASTASIO SOMOZA DID DURING THE LAST DAYS OF HIS DICTATORSHIP,
IS SHOWING THE WORLD:

   1.  THE FASCIST NATURE OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE FASCIST
NATURE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMNY] HAS REMOVED THE CIVILIAN MASK OFF
THE GOVERNMENT'S FACE AND SHOWN ITS REAL MILITARY AND FASCIST FACE.

   2.  THESE BOMBINGS PROVE THAT AS THE HOURS GO BY THEY BECOME MORE
DESPERATE AND HAVE LOST TOTAL CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THE PROMISES
MADE BY CRISTIANI AND THE DEFENSE MINISTER THAT THEY WOULD GET THE
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON SATURDAY HAS FAILED.  ON SATURDAY NIGHT
COLONEL [RENE] PONCE PROMISED TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL ON
SATURDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, MORE THAN 32 HOURS HAVE GONE BY AND THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE
REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, AND THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] MILITARY
POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED AFTER MORE THAT 32 HOURS
OF UNINTERRUPTED FIGHTING.  THE PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS
FAILED.  THE U.S. ADVISERS AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS
PLAN FOR MONTHS.  WE HEREBY ADVISE THE PEOPLE THAT THE PLAN FOR THE
DEFENSE OF SAN SALVADOR HAS FAILED.  THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PREVENT OUR
FORCES FROM ARMING AND GETTING SUPPLIES; THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP OUR
FMLN FORCES FROM ENTERING SAN SALVADOR, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
STOP OUR ADVANCE OR RECOVER A SINGLE INCH OF THE CITY OCCUPIED BY THE
FMLN.  WE CAN STATE THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WIN BACK A
SINGLE INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER OUR CONTROL IN MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, UNIVERSITARIA NORTE, OR SOYAPANGA.  THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE A SINGLE INCH.  EVERY SINGLE STEP IN
AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE OCCUPY HAS COST THEM DEARLY IN
DEAD AND WOUNDED.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] REBEL GUERRILLA
UNITS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE COASTAL RAILROAD LINES NEAR LA CASONA,
JIQUILISCO JURISDICTION.  THE REBELS HAVE SET UP BARRICADES AND HAVE
COMPLETELY PARALYZED VEHICLE TRAFFIC.  A RAILROAD BRIDGE BETWEEN
TIERRA BLANCA AND JIQUILISCO HAS BEEN PARTIALLY DESTROYED WITH
DYNAMITE.  THE STRETCH BETWEEN SAN MARCOS LEMPA AND TIERRA BLANCA HAS
BEEN CONTROLLED IN THE VICINITY OF THE 14 JULY NEIGHBORHOOD.

   A REPORT FROM LA PAZ DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT AT 1145 [1745 GMT] TODAY A
SOLDIER FROM THE ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT [DMIFA] FIRED
A RIFLE AT A CIVILIAN WOMAN, WOUNDING HER IN THE HEAD.  THIS HAPPENED IN
THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT.  DMIFA
SOLDIERS CONTINUE TO INFLICT CASUALTIES AMONG THE CIVILIANS, AS A RESULT
OF THEIR DESPERATION.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS AND RADIO FARABUNDO MARTI IN A NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
NETWORK REPEAT THE REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS STRAFFING THE INCA FACTORY
IN SOYAPANGA AND PRADOS DE VENECIA, WHERE IT HAS KILLED 3 AND WOUNDED 12
CIVILIANS.  HOMES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED IN PRADOS DE VENECIA AS A
RESULT OF THE INDISCRIMINATE STRAFFING BY THE ARMED FORCES.

   WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE FELICIANO AMA WESTERN FRONT TO THE EFFECT
THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] IS HOLDING
POSITIONS IN VILLA LOS NARANJOS AND LA UNION NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA ANA.
REPORTS ADD THAT REVOLUTIONARY FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN SANTA ANA,
WHERE THE FMLN RED AND WHITE FLAG IS BEING HOISTED.  GREETINGS TO THE
FIGHTERS IN SANTA ANA CITY, AND FORWARD!

ACCORDING TO AN FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
FIGHTER WHO TURNED HIMSELF IN TO THE ARMY, HIS COMRADES, THE FMLN
TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO ATTACK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, ARE WITHOUT
AMMUNITION AND FOOD.  THUS, TO WIN TIME AND LIFT THE SPIRITS OF
COMMANDERS AND WARRIORS THEY RESORT TO LIES AND SAY THEY CONTROL SOME
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS TOTALLY
FALSE.  THE ARMED FORCES CALLS ON CITIZENS TO CONTINUE TO REPUDIATE
THESE CRIMINALS, WHO HAVE ONLY BROUGHT PAIN, DEATH, AND UNCERTAINTY
WITH THEIR VANDALISTIC ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] APPROXIMATELY 100 SALVADORAN ARMY
SOLDIERS BEGAN A COUNTEROFFENSIVE AT 1650 (2250 GMT) WITH ARMORED VEHICLES
AND CANONS IN AN EFFORT TO OUST APPROXIMATELY 150 GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WHO
HAVE ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MEJICANOS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.  

   TWO ARMY COLUMNS WERE DEPLOYED FROM THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE TO
MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A POPULATION OF
APPROXIMATELY 125,000, WHERE THE REBELS HAVE CONTROLLED STRATEGIC
POSITIONS SINCE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) BEGAN
"A NATIONAL OFFENSIVE" AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT
ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   LOUD EXPLOSIONS AND HEAVY GUNFIRE IS CURRENTLY HEARD IN THE DOWNTOWN

DEV-MUC3-0722 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] IS USING DISINFORMATION
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN BEATEN BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE FMLN TODAY
RESORTED TO THE STRATEGY OF DISINFORMATION SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN
DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE AND PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  IN A DESPERATE
MANNER AND THROUGH THEIR CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION, THE FMLN IS
BROADCASTING FALSE REPORTS, SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING.  THEY SAID THEY
WERE FIGHTING THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT THIS MORNING
AND THAT THIS OCCURRED 10 BLOCKS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  THE
FMLN INSISTED THAT CIVILIANS HAD HELPED THEM AT THE REBEL BARRICADES.
THIS IS TOTALLY FALSE.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF SAN
JACINTO NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE INVENTIONS BROADCAST BY THE FMLN ARE A
STRATEGY TO CONFUSE PEOPLE.  THE ARMED FORCES CALL ON ALL SALVADORANS NOT
TO BE SURPRISED BY THESE STRATEGIES AND TO CONTINUE REPUDIATING THE
TERRORIST CRIMINALS, WHO HAVE ONLY BROUGHT AGGRESSION, PAIN, AND GRIEF TO
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE ENTIRE NATIONAL
TERRITORY, INCLUDING SAN SALVADOR.  THE SHOTS THAT ARE HEARD OR WERE HEARD
A FEW HOURS AGO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES DEFENSE AGAINST
INDISCRIMINATE FMLN ATTACKS ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

[NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] [TEXT] 1. GIVEN THE STATE OF SIEGE THAT
HAS PREVAILED IN THE COUNTRY SINCE 11 NOVEMBER, AND ACCORDING TO THE
NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IS REQUIRED TO
COOPERATE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND THE VARIOUS SECURITY CORPS WHEN
NECESSARY -- MAKING SURE THIS COOPERATION INVOLVES ARMY MEMBERS OR
DULY AUTHORIZED JUDICIAL OFFICIALS.

   2. UPON LEARNING THAT ARMED TERRORISTS ARE OPERATING NEAR YOUR AREAS OF
RESIDENCE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL TELEPHONE NUMBER 123 OR NOTIFY THE
NEAREST MILITARY POST.

   3. THE POPULATION MUST REMAIN CALM AND GO TO WORK, WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR RESPECTIVE RESIDENCES WHEN THE
CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT AT 1800.

   4. THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN IN THEIR RESIDENCES AND STAY
OFF THE STREETS, EVEN UPON HEARING THAT AN ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATION IS
TAKING PLACE NEARBY -- THIS IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY FOR MINORS.

   5.  THE SALVADORAN POPULATION ENGAGED IN COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES,
PARTICULARLY THE SALE OF STAPLES, MUST REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A DECREE
THAT FORBIDS MARKING UP PRICES, SINCE THIS WOULD BE AN ANTIPATRIOTIC
ACTION DURING THESE CRUCIAL TIMES FOR THE COUNTRY.

   6.  THE SALVADORAN POPULATION MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE INFORMATION
BEING ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE IT WILL
BE PROVIDED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ACCORDING TO THE TRUTH.  THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION CAN ALSO REST ASSURED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES ARE EFFICIENTLY AND PROFESSIONALLY CONTROLLING THE GROUPS OF
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST CRIMINALS.
THEREFORE, THE POPULATION MUST REMAIN CALM AND REJECT THE
DISINFORMATION BEING ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
SUBVERSION.


DEV-MUC3-0724 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT DENOUNCES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THE MEDDLING
OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST GROUPS.  IN A SPEECH ON 12 NOVEMBER,
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA OPENLY MADE IRRESPONSIBLE
STATEMENTS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN EL SALVADOR WHICH ARE TOTALLY
REMOVED FROM REALITY.  PRESIDENT ORTEGA SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT IS ATTACKING THE PEOPLE WHEN THE TRUTH IS THAT THE FMLN
UNLEASHED THIS TERRORIST ESCALATION BY USING WEAPONS AND AMMUNITIONS
SUPPLIED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT'S MEDDLING IN THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
MORE CLOSELY.  THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT MAJOR CRIMES HAVE BEEN PLANNED ON
NICARAGUAN TERRITORY, EVEN AGAINST FMLN LEADERS.  THE LATE TOP FMLN
LEADER, CAYETANO CARPIO, ORDERED THE MURDER OF MELIDA ANAYA MONTES, WHOM
THE REBELS CALLED COMMANDER ANA MARIA FROM NICARAGUA.  FMLN COMMANDER
JOAQUIN VILLALBOS, WHO ORDERED THE MURDER OF MARXIST POET ROQUE DALTON
GARCIA, CONTINUES TO LIVE IN NICARAGUA.  THE MARXIST - LENINIST CONSPIRACY
WHICH WANTS TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO A TOTALITARIAN
DICTATORSHIP IS PLANNED, LED, AND IMPLEMENTED ON NICARAGUAN TERRITORY.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR MANY YEARS FROM
THE BLOODTHIRSTY FMLN ATTACKS, KNOW THAT FMLN IS THE ONE WHO HAS CRUELLY
MURDERED CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY, AND HAS NOT RESPECTED SEX OR
AGE.  THIS IS THE FMLN THAT IS MERCILESSLY ATTACKING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  AT PRESENT, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE FULFILLING THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND LIVES AND THE PROPERTIES OF
SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE FMLN HAS FAILED IN ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE.  IT
ENTERED THE CITY, THE WAY ALL COWARDS ENTER TO KILL BY SURPRISE AND IN
COLD BLOOD DEFENSELESS PEOPLE.

   HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE'S ARMED WING, NAMELY, THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES,
HAVE REPELLED THE AGGRESSORS WHO ARE BEING DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA WITH
PROFESSIONALISM. SO FAR, NOT ONE OF THE COWARDLY FMLN LEADERS HAS SHOWN UP
IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY.  THESE CRIMINALS HAVE PUSHED THEIR MURDEROUS
HOARDES TO INDISCRIMINATELY FIRE AT THE ENTIRE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE CONDEMNED, REJECTED, AND REPUDIDATED THE FMLN'S
TERRORIST ATTACK.  

   THE MURDEROUS LEADERS BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD RALLY BEHIND AND
ACCOMPANY THEM IN THEIR FAILED REBELLIOUS OFFENSIVE; THEY TRIED TO HAND
OUT WEAPONS IN SOME TOWNS. JUST AS THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE
TERRORISTS AT THE POLLS, THEY REJECT THEM NOW ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY KNOW
THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR HUNGER, POVERTY, AND SUFFERING.
TO THE FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WHO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLE OF
NONINTERVENTION IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF STATES, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
AND GOVERNMENT DEMAND THE CONDEMNATION OF THE MEDDLING BY THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT WITH ITS LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE FMLN AND THAT NICARAGUA
STOPS LENDING ITS TERRITORY FOR THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS NATION THAT
WANTS TO LIVE PEACEFULLY IN DEMOCRACY BASED ON A RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND
FULL LIBERTY.  


DEV-MUC3-0725 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER]
COLONEL PONCE, WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR
AND IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS?

   [PONCE] GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE ARMED FORCES WANT TO
PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR COOPERATION DURING
THIS TIME WHEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TERRORIST HORDES ARE CARRYING OUT AN ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST ALL OF
OUR PEOPLE.

   THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:  FIGHTING
IS ONGOING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR -- IN MEJICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, AND THE ZACAMIL AREAS.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME CLASHES IN THE
NORTHWESTERN AREA OF SOYAPANGO, IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF BOSQUES DEL
RIO, MONTE FRESCO, EL PETETE, AND SAN JOSE.

   THERE IS SOME SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CIUDAD CREDISA, AS WELL AS IN SANTA
MARTA.  THAT IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN
THE AREA OF SAN SALVADOR.  

   IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS, ON SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS FIGHTING
IN SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SOME SPORADIC
FIGHTING IN CHALATENANGO.  OF ALL THESE PLACES, THE TERRORISTS INCREASED
THEIR AGGRESSION TODAY ONLY IN ZACATECOLUCA.  THE TERRORISTS,
UNFORTUNATELY, TOOK OVER THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, KILLING ONE SOLDIER
WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REGAINED
CONTROL OF THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS OF THE HOSPITAL.  APPROXIMATELY 10
TO 15 TERRORISTS ARE ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS, AND THE TROUBLE IS
THAT THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE ON THOSE FLOORS.

   SO, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED AGGRESSION, THE INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM
THAT THE FMLN HAS LAUNCHED AT THIS TIME IN AN IRRATIONAL MANNER AGAINST
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, HAS BEEN CONTROLLED.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE FIGHTING
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS.  

   [REPORTER] TO SUM UP, WE COULD THEN SAY THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW
GUERRILLA RESISTANCE POCKETS IN THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED.  THIS
CONTRADICTS THE REPORTS FROM THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS TO THE EFFECT
THAT THEY CONTROL CERTAIN AREAS.

   [PONCE] I MUST ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS ALSO SOME FIGHTING IN CIUDAD
DELGADO.  I CAN CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT CONTROL ANY
POINT IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY.  THEY ARE SHOUTING ABROAD THAT THEY
CONTROL CERTAIN POINTS IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, THE
MEDIA, AND THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ARE WITNESSES TO THE FACT THE FMLN
DOES NOT CONTROL ANY PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR OR IN THE OTHER
DEPARTMENTS.  THERE ARE STILL SOME FMLN REDOUBTS, WHICH WE ARE
CURRENTLY CONTROLLING IN ORDER TO EXPEL FROM THE URBAN AREAS THE
TERRORISTS WHO ARE ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   NATURALLY, WE HAVE SOME COMBAT LIMITATIONS IN THE URBAN AREAS, BECAUSE
THE TERRORISTS ARE SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND
ARE HOLDING MANY FAMILIES HOSTAGES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. THE TERRORISTS HAVE
ALSO PLACED SNIPERS ON SOME TALL BUILDINGS. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES
ARE ASKING FOR THE PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING.  IF WE WERE TO USE OUR MILITARY
POWER, AS WE COULD DO IN A COMBAT ZONE, WE WOULD KILL MANY INNOCENT
PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0726 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [PONCE] AND WE NOT WANT TO
DO THAT. WE WANT TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION IN A CAUTIOUS WAY, ALWAYS
RESPECTING AND PROTECTING OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THAT IS WHY WE ASK
THOSE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY
TERRORISTS TO BE PATIENT.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE MAKING AN
EFFORT TO REACH ALL THE AREAS WHERE THIS SITUATION PREVAILS SO THAT WE CAN
RESCUE ALL OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS.  

   [REPORTER] THESE REMARKS ARE INTENDED TO REVEAL THE PROFESSIONAL NATURE
OF THE ARMED FORCES AND REAFFIRM SOMETHING MANY SALVADORANS HAVE IN MIND.
REGARDING THIS MILITARY OFFENSIVE, HAS THE FMLN RECEIVED MILITARY AND
PERSONNEL AID FROM ABROAD?

   [PONCE] SURE, NICARAGUA HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE FMLN. PRESIDENT
ORTEGA IS DOING THIS [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION]. THE NICARAGUAN
FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN MEXICO, IS GIVING HIS FULL
SUPPORT TO THE FMLN.  HE SAYS THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
ALREADY ACHIEVED THEIR VICTORY IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FMLN ARE LIARS.
THEY FOLLOW THE SAME COMMUNISTS' SLOGANS: LIE, LIE, AND LIE.  HERE NO
ONE BELIEVES THAT.  A TRUCK LOADED WITH WEAPONS IN SANTA ANA WAS
DRIVEN BY AN EAST GERMAN.  SOME OF THE CAPTURED PEOPLE ARE FOREIGNERS.
I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE THEY COME FROM.

   [REPORTER] YOUR REMARKS CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF MERCENARIES IN THE
CURRENT ARMED STRUGGLE, WHICH WOULD BE....

   [PONCE, INTERRUPTING] I CAN ALSO ADD THAT WE RECEIVED INFORMATION
BEFORE 10 NOVEMBER THAT A GROUP OF TERRORIST FIGHTERS HAD COME TO THE
COUNTRY'S EASTERN ZONE FROM NICARAGUA.  THEY MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS
TERRORIST ACTION.  

   [REPORTER] AS FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN
NOW, CAN YOU TELL HOW MANY FMLN REBELS HAVE DIED IN THIS OFFENSIVE?

   [PONCE] NATIONWIDE, WE COUNTED 230 TERRORISTS KILLED, AND 136 TERRORIST
WOUNDED; 72 TERRORIST WERE CAPTURED.  ONE TERRORIST WAS PRESENTED TO THE
PRESS.

   [REPORTER] CAN THE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS KILLED AND WOUNDED BE TOTALLED
NOW?

   [PONCE] THAT IS THE MOST REGRETTABLE ASPECT OF THIS IRRATIONAL FMLN
ACTION.  THIS ACTION HAS IMPERILED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE
ARMED UPRISING.  WE REGRET THAT 17 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND 86 HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED.

   [REPORTER] THIS FIGURE IS REALLY REGRETTABLE.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
TUNED INTO THIS NATIONAL NETWORK.  WE HAVE HEARD MANY TELEPHONE CALLS
REITERATING SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES'
ACTIONS.  IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY IN AREAS WHERE THE CURFEW WAS ORDERED.
WHAT SUGGESTIONS CAN YOU OFFER PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL CITY?

   [PONCE] TO REPORT AN EMERGENCY THEY CAN DIAL 3 IF THEY HAVE A TELEPHONE
AVAILABLE.  OTHERWISE, OR IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE, IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR ARMS UP CARRYING SOME WHITE FLAG OR
CLOTH AND GO TO A NEARBY UNIT TO GET AID. PEOPLE MUST KEEP IN MIND THE
ARMED FORCES ARE THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE AND WILL SERVE THE PEOPLE.
TRUST AND GO TO YOUR ARMED FORCES.

   [REPORTER] THESE WERE THE REMARKS OF COL RENE EMILIO PONCE.  HE IS NOW
LEAVING THIS NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK.

   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS HAVE BEEN
SEIZED.  WE CAN CONFIRM THE MEDDLING OF SOME COMMUNIST BLOC COUNTRIES IN
THIS. WE SEIZED RUSSIAN AND NORTH KOREAN WEAPONS WHICH PROBABLY ENTERED
THROUGH CUBA AND NICARAGUA.  I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT SINCE THE FMLN FIRED
MORTARS FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY MORNING, WE
HAD TO REMOVE THE TERRORISTS FROM SEVERAL POINTS.  WE FOUND WEAPONS,
EXPLOSIVES, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEDICINE INSIDE THE NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY.  SOME MEN WERE KILLED WITH THEIR RIFLES IN THEIR HANDS; WE
ALSO CAPTURED OTHERS WHO WERE INSIDE THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

   I ALSO WANT TO ASK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR ITS UNDERSTANDING AND TO
TRUST THEIR ARMED FORCES.  THESE ARMED FORCES BELONG TO THE PEOPLE AND
SERVE THEM.  WE ARE ACTING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.  BE PATIENT, REMAIN
CALM, AND WE WILL MOVE AHEAD WITH GOD'S BLESSING AND HELP.  ALSO, I WANT
TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE THE MILITARY CHIEFS, OFFICERS, ENLISTED MEN,
SECURITY CORPS OFFICIALS, AND ALL THE ARMED FORCES' ACTIVE PERSONNEL FOR
THEIR HEROIC WORK IN DEFENDING OUR PEOPLE, DEMOCRACY, LIBERTY, AND PEACE.
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN HEROIC, AND ALL OF US RECOGNIZE THIS.  MAY HISTORY
DO YOU JUSTICE TOMORROW.  YOU MUST FEEL PROUD BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING WHAT
EVERY PATRIOT MUST DO, DEFEND THE FATHERLAND.  


DEV-MUC3-0727 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S
COUNTERATTACK AGAINST REBEL POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS, ON THE NORTHERN SIDE
OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WAS SUSPENDED AT 1745 (2345 GMT), 1 HOUR AFTER IT
BEGAN AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF IT.

   TWO COLUMNS OF SOME 100 SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS, ARMED WITH RIFLES AND
ARTILLERY WEAPONS, STARTED TO ATTACK ABOUT 150 GUERRILLAS WHO CONTROL
AMPLE POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS WHERE SOME 125,000 PEOPLE LIVE.  DURING THAT
HOUR, STRONG EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD NEAR MEJICANOS; THEY LATER STOPPED WHEN
A HEAVY RAIN FELL FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

   THERE ARE NO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AREA; THEREFORE, IT HAS
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERATTACK.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN THE CONACASTE NEIGHBORHOOD OF
SOYAPANGO, ALSO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, FIVE PRIVATE HOMES WERE STRAFFED
BY ARMY HELICOPTERS. THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET.

   ACCORDING TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR, THE NATIONAL OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED ON 12 NOVEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED IN 305
DEAD AND 373 WOUNDED, INCLUDING GUERRILLAS, SOLDIERS, AND CIVILIANS.


DEV-MUC3-0728 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] SINCE
1981 THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS BEEN
INSISTING ON THE NEED FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  ITS
EFFORTS MET WITH THE STUBBORN OPPOSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE
COUNTRY'S ULTRARIGHTIST SECTORS, WHO ARE THE ONES WHO IN REALITY HAVE
WIELDED TOTAL POWER.

   WE PRESENTED DOZENS OF NEGOTIATING PROPOSALS IN WHICH WE INCREASINGLY
MADE OUR POSITIONS MORE FLEXIBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE MILITARY REALITY
DEMONSTRATED THAT WE WERE INVINCIBLE.  WE PRESENTED TO THE CURRENT
NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL THAT HAD
REAL POSSIBILITIES OF BRINGING ABOUT PEACE.  HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE WE
RECEIVED WAS AN ESCALATION OF REPRESSION BY MEANS OF TORTURE AND MURDER,
WHICH CULMINATED WITH THE MASSACRE OF THE WORKERS OF THE SALVADORAN
WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION [FENASTRAS].

   THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED OUR FORMULAS FOR NEGOTIATION IN WORD AND IN
DEED, AND INSTEAD DEEPENED THE CAUSES BEHIND THE WAR BY WORSENING THE
SOCIAL CRISIS AND REDUCING THE RANGE OF ACTIVITY OF THE POPULAR SECTORS.
FACED WITH A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT THREATENED NOT ONLY TO SHUT OFF A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE WAR, BUT INSTEAD TO INCREASE THE KILLINGS AND
OTHER FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, THE FMLN
DECIDED TO LAUNCH A FORCEFUL AND STRATEGIC MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT WOULD
PUT A HALT TO THE FASCISTS AND OPEN UP A POSSIBILITY TO BRING AN END TO
THE WAR.

   CONSEQUENTLY, AT 2000 ON 11 NOVEMBER OUR FORCES ENTERED INTO COMBAT
AGAINST ALL THE TARGETS DESIGNATED IN OUR OFFENSIVE PLAN, DESPITE ALL THE
PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND ARRANGEMENTS SET UP BY THE ARMY TO TRY TO HALT
US.  OUR EXPERIENCED FIGHTERS, IN SPITE OF THE DISADVANTAGE IN FORCES AND
ARMS, HAVE FULFILLED OUR GOALS BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS, CARRYING OUT ONE
OF THE MOST GLORIOUS MILITARY BATTLES IN THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S WAR.
IN UNDER 15 HOURS, WE GAINED CONTROL OVER STRATEGIC TERRITORIES, WIPED OUT
DOZENS OF ENEMY TROOPS, TOOK PRISONERS, RECOVERED WEAPONS, AND DESTROYED
ARMORED VEHICLES AND AIRPLANES.

   AFTER 4 CONTINUOUS DAYS OF FIGHTING, OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED ALL
COUNTERATTACKS BY THE ENEMY AND HAVE GAINED NEW POSITIONS.  THOUSANDS OF
RESIDENTS OF THE CITIES HAVE STAGED POPULAR UPRISINGS TO SUPPORT OUR
FORCES, WHICH HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY NEW FIGHTERS.  FACED WITH THIS
SITUATION, THE ARENA GOVERNMENT AND THE CLIQUE OF CORRUPT MILITARY
OFFICERS KNOWN AS LA TANDONA WHO COMMAND THE ARMED FORCES, HAVE ORDERED
CRIMINAL BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING
DOWN THE POPULAR UPRISINGS.  THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR
FORCES AND REDOUBLED THE PEOPLE'S RAGE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT LED BY

[STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] PEACE
IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF WE EVICT FROM POWER THOSE WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM
WAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND:

   1.  ORDERS THAT ALL OUR UNITS MUST HOLD THE POSITIONS CONQUERED,
ORGANIZE THE GENERAL UPRISING OF OUR PEOPLE, AND CARRY OUT ALL THE TASKS
DEALING WITH THE POPULATION'S SECURITY AND DEFENSE AND THE COLLECTION OF
FOOD AND ITS DISTRIBUTION TO THE NEEDY.

   2.  CALLS THE PEOPLE TO A GENERAL UPRISING SO THEY CAN JOIN US IN
BATTLE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WITH ALL TYPES OF WEAPONS TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AND STRIKE THE ENEMY.

   3.  ANNOUNCES THAT, EFFECTIVE AS SOON AS THIS MANIFESTO IS ANNOUNCED,
WE DECLARE AS TERRITORIES LIBERATED BY THE PEOPLE ALL THE AREAS UNDER OUR
CONTROL IN MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, LA UNION, USULUTAN, CUSCATLAN,
CHALATENANGO, SAN VICENTE, AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THIS, OUR FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WILL ORGANIZE POPULAR GOVERNMENTS IN EVERY
MUNICIPALITY IN THESE DEPARTMENTS.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, OUR FORCES THAT
CONTROL TERRITORIES IN THE CITIES MUST INTENSIFY THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE
TOTAL CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY.

   4.  URGES ALL THE WORKERS TO STOP WORKING AS PART OF THE GENERALIZED
STRUGGLE, WHICH WILL HELP WEAKEN THE JANUARY GOVERNMENT AND WILL ENABLE
ALL TO JOIN US IN COMBAT.  THEREFORE, WE HEREBY ANNOUNCE THAT THE CURRENT
TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, THE SABOTAGING OF THE ENERGY SUPPLY, AND THE
CLOSING OF GASOLINE STATIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME.  FOR
THIS REASON, THE PEOPLE MUST PREPARE FOR THIS SITUATION.  WE STERNLY WARN
THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO FORCE THEIR WORKERS TO GO TO WORK THAT OUR FORCES HAVE
BEEN INSTRUCTED TO IMPOSE OBEDIENCE TO THIS MEASURE.

   5.  ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO
SEND HELP TO THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF BOMBINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE
CREATION OF REFUGES AND CENTERS TO PROTECT THE POPULATION FROM THE
CRIMINAL ACTIONS UNLEASHED BY CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
HIGH COMMAND.

   6.  URGENTLY CALLS ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES, POPULAR
ORGANIZATIONS, AND PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN IN OUR COUNTRY TO ASSUME AT THIS
TIME THE HISTORIC ROLE OF MAKERS AND BUILDERS OF A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC
SOLUTION THAT CAN BRING LASTING PEACE TO OUR COUNTRY.

   7.  MAKES A PATRIOTIC EXHORTATION TO OFFICERS AND THE RANK AND FILE
OF THE ARMY NOT TO LET THE BIG BATCH [LA TANDONA, THE GRADUATING CLASS
OF THE MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT ARMY STAFF MEMBERS], ARENA, AND THE
U.S.  INTERESTS LEAD THEM TO CONFRONT THE PEOPLE, THUS STAINING THEIR
HANDS WITH BLOOD.  THE FMLN DOES NOT REGARD THEM AS ENEMIES AND IS
READY TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE ARMY SECTORS WHO DESIRE JUSTICE,
SOVEREIGNTY, AND TRUE DEMOCRACY FOR OUR PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY OF THE
PEOPLE AND ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES IS LA
TANDONA, WHO HAVE ENRICHED THEMSELVES WITH WAR, AND THE ARENA DEATH
SQUADS.  THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THEY ARE THE
ONES WHO DO NOT WANT A REGIME OF JUSTICE.  WE CALL ALL THE NATION TO
FIGHT THEM SO WE CAN SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, WHICH THE TYRANNY HAS
TRIED TO BURY, AND WHICH SAYS: FREEDOM IS ITS DOGMA AND GUIDELINE,
WHICH IT HAS SWORN TO DEFEND A THOUSAND TIMES, AND JUST AS MANY TIMES,
HAS SWORN TO REJECT THE HATEFUL POWER OF A BOLD TYRANNY.

THE NONCOMBATANT POPULATION.  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 2, PARAGRAPH A OF THE
OAS CHARTER, AMENDED BY THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL, ONE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S
MAIN PURPOSES IS TO STRENGTHEN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE CONTINENT.
SOLIDARITY AMONG AMERICAN STATES [WORDS INDISTINCT] MAKES IT AN URGENT

HELP ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT
AND TO END THE BLOODSHED.  THEREFORE:

   1. WE URGENTLY CALL ON THE SALVADORAN REGIME TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE
BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ACTS OF REPRESSION LIKE AT SAN
SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.

IMMEDIATELY, THE WOUNDED CAN BE EVACUATED, AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION CAN

CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA], CREATED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ON 7 NOVEMBER

SELF-DETERMINATION; B) ENFORCE THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
REGARDING HUMANITARIANISM, PARTICULARLY ARTICLE 3 OF THE GENEVA
CONVENTIONS SIGNED IN 1949, WHICH DEAL WITH EXPENDITURES DUE TO WAR,
PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

  5.  WE ASK THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL TO UTILIZE ALL AVAILABLE INDIRECT

REPORT ON ARMED FORCES MILITARY ACTIONS: IN THE 1ST MILITARY ZONE
CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN THE AREAS OF SAN JOSE GUAYABAL AND SAN

TRULY SEEK THE WELFARE OF SALVADORANS, BUT INSTEAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE OPPROBIOUS AND TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP THAT THE FMLN TERRORISTS
WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE.  THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE FMLN HERE IN EL

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] AN OPPOSITION LABOR
FEDERATION ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT WILL CALL A GENERAL STRIKE IF THE
AIR FORCE CONTINUES TO BOMB NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
AND CALLED FOR AN INITIAL CLOSING DOWN OF WORK CENTERS TO COMPEL THE
GOVERNMENT TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   JULIO CESAR PORTILLO, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN
WORKERS [UNTS], AT THE SAME TIME DENIED THAT THE LABOR LEADERS HAD
TAKEN REFUGE IN THE MEXICAN EMBASSY, AND AFFIRMED THAT "WE ARE
WORKING, TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   ACCORDING TO PORTILLO, THE CLOSEDOWN COULD LEAD TO A GENERAL STRIKE
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO "DEFEND THE WORKERS AND COMPEL THE GOVERNMENT
TO NEGOTIATE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THIS WAR."

   THE LEADER OF THE UNTS, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS IS A FRONT FOR
THE GUERRILLAS, ASKED ALL THE WORKERS TO STAY HOME AND SAID: "WE
DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY HALT ALL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE
AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   PORTILLO SAID THAT A GENERAL STRIKE HAS NOT YET BEEN CALLED, BUT
DID NOT RULE ONE OUT IF "THE REPRESSION AND THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING
OF THE PEOPLE" CONTINUE.

   AT A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE LABOR LEADER SAID THAT "THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.  THE CRISIS IS
DEEPENING."

   PORTILLO SAID THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS -- ESPECIALLY IN
THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PART OF THE CITY WHERE
THE FIERCEST CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE -- WHO DO NOT HAVE FOOD OR
MEDICINE AND WHO ARE LIVING UNDER DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, IN THE MIDST
OF FIREFIGHTS.

   ACCORDING TO THE UNTS LEADER, IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS LABOR AND
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS WILL SET UP "REFUGEE CENTERS" TO ASSIST THE
SALVADORANS WHO ARE TRAPPED IN THE COMBAT AREAS.

   THE LEADER WARNED THAT STORES AND SUPERMARKETS MIGHT BE SACKED AND
SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED SATURDAY EVENING "IS THE

DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN COME TO POWER IN EL SALVADOR," BUT ADDED
THAT HE HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING A RUMOR SPREAD TODAY IN SAN
SALVADOR THAT THE GUERRILLAS OR SOME POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD
ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.

TROOPS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR AS WELL AS IN TOWNS
IN THE INTERIOR, TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL AREAS IN EIGHT OF EL
SALVADOR'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE "LIBERATED TERRITORIES."

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] OUR FORCES HAVE ALSO
ENGAGED TROOPS POSTED AT THE PRESIDENTE HOTEL AND IN ITS VICINITY, BUT ONCE
AGAIN RESPECTED THE U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  DURING THE ENTIRE MANEUVER
WE INFLICTED APPROXIMATELY 20 CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY, BUT WE DID NOT LOSE
ANY MEN.

   MEANWHILE, WE HAVE HAD REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT THE AIR FORCE
IS BOMBING HEAVILY DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN THE SECTOR OF CIUDAD
DELGADO.  COMMANDER CARLOS ANNOUNCED THIS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SAN
SALVADOR: A GOVERNMENT THAT BOMBS THE PEOPLE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT; A GOVERNMENT FACING THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS IN ARMS IS AN
ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND A GOVERNMENT THAT MASSACRES THE PEOPLE IS
AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT; AND AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT MUST BE
TOPPLED BY OUR FORCES.

   NOW, WE HAVE A LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  AT THIS VERY
MOMENT, AN O-2 AIRPLANE IS THROWING ROCKETS AT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL,
WHERE HEAVY FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE
HAVE BEEN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THIS ATTACK.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN
CONFIRMED THAT THE THREE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS THAT WERE
DESTROYED IN ZACAMIL WERE DESTROYED ON THE STREET THAT JOINS THE
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE METROPOLI NEIGHBORHOOD.

   IN ANOTHER REPORT FROM OUR COMPANEROS IN SOYAPANGO, THEY HAVE
INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING THE TROOPS IN
THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO.  IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS NORTH AMERICAN IS
THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTING THE AIR ATTACK IN THE SECTOR OF SOYAPANGO.
C-47 AIRPLANES AS WELL AS UH-1M, HUEY 500, AND UH-1H HELICOPTERS, ALL
U.S. MADE, HAVE BEEN THROWING ROCKETS ON AND MACHINEGUNNING THE
SECTORS OF SOYAPANGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO.  THE FASCIST REGIME OF LA
TANDONA [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY], CRISTIANI, AND D'AUBUISSON HAVE DECREED A
CURFEW IN ALL OF THE AREAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF OUR FORCES IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO WITNESSES OF
THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING.  WE ISSUE AN URGENT CALL TO THE RED
CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO GO TO SOYAPANGO, WHERE
THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN
URGENT APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS SO THAT
THEY CAN [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, TO GET HIM TO STOP THIS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING ONCE AND FOR
ALL.

   A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL STATES THAT FMLN FORCES THIS AFTERNOON
ARE ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION POSITIONS AND HARRASSING THE ARMED
FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING IN THE
CAPITAL, ROADBLOCKS CONTINUE TO MULTIPLY THROUGHOUT.  THIS IS THE
SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

   AS REPORTED ON THE EVENING OF 13 NOVEMBER, WE ATTACKED THE SAN
BENITO BATTALION AT THE NATIONAL FAIR GROUNDS AND THE FORCES GUARDING
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  THIS IS THE SECOND HARRASSMENT ATTACK ON
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.  THIS COMPLICATES THE ARMED FORCES'
SITUATION IN THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES' TOP
LEADERSHIP IS BEING ATTACKED AND HARRASSED.  FMLN FORCES ARE
BESIEGING THE ENEMY.

   AIR FORCE AIRCRAFTS CONTINUE TO OVERFLY THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE
CAPITAL THIS AFTERNOON.  THEY CONTINUE TO MACHINEGUN AND BOMB THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MOMENTS AGO, WE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS HEAVY
BOMBING IN ZACAMIL AGAINST THE POPULATION.  WE CALL ON THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS COMMITTEE TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO ZACAMIL TO
EVACUATE CIVILIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED THESE COWARDLY AND BLOODY
AIR FORCE BOMBINGS.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE A REPORT FROM
OUR COMMANDING POST IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER
CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO.  BECAUSE OF CERTAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE
COMMUNICATIONS, THE QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE CLEAR, BUT THE ANSWERS WILL BE.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO, WE ARE
INTERVIEWING YOU FROM RADIO VENCEREMOS HERE IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.  WE
HAVE HEARD REPORTS FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN RADIO STATIONS SPEAKING ABOUT
ROCKET FIRE AND BOMBINGS IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  COULD YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION?

   [ARMIJO] WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING OUR POSITION FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  CURRENTLY, THERE IS ROCKET AND MACHINEGUN FIRE BEING
LAUNCED AGAINST OUR POSITIONS.  THE ENEMY IS DESPERATE.  THIS MORNING
WE REPELLED AN ATTACK.  THEY FLED IN DISARRAY BECAUSE NO ONE CAME TO
SUPPORT THEM.

   [REPORTER] THE FASCIST DISINFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING THAT
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN].  WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FMLN FIGHTERS
IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD?

   [ARMIJO] THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN POSITIVE.  THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING
US TREAT THE WOUNDED.  THEY HAVE HELPED US WITH FOOD PROBLEMS.  THEY
HAVE SUPPORTED US COMPLETELY BY PLACING BARRICADES ON THE STREETS.
THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT IN THIS AREA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
THE ENEMY'S PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

   [REPORTER] WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM OUR COMRADES IN
SOYAPANGO WHO SAY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A U.S. ADVISER LEADING ENEMY
TROOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.  HAVE ANY OF YOUR MEN SEEN ANY U.S.  ADVISERS?
[ARMIJO] [WORD INDISTINCT] NOT SEEN THEM, BUT [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE MORALE OF THE FMLN TROOPS PARTICULARLY IN
THE ZACAMIL AREA?  THE FASCIST INFORMATION NETWORK HAS BEEN SAYING
THAT FMLN TROOPS ARE LEAVING THEIR POSTS.

   [ARMIJO] THEIR MORALE IS HIGH.  WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE PEOPLE'S
SUPPORT.  WE ARE VERY DETERMINED.  THE ENEMY'S ATTACKS HAVE BEEN
REPELLED.

   [REPORTER] COULD YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO FMLN TROOPS IN ZACAMIL
NEIGHBORHOOD AND TO THOSE IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL AS WELL AS TO FMLN FIGHTERS HOLDING THEIR POSITIONS IN OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY?

   [ARMIJO] THE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING US.  WE ARE WAGING ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  THE OUTLOOK FOR
VICTORY DEPENDS ON WHAT EACH OF US DOES.  WE MUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

   THIS HAS BEEN A RECORDED INTERVIEW.  WE INTERVIEWED COMMANDER
CLAUDIO RABINDRANATH ARMIJO A FEW MINUTES AGO.  HE IS CURRENTLY AT A
COMMAND POST IN SAN SALVADOR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS IS CADENA NACIONAL, THE NETWORK OF
FREEDOM, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S NETWORK.  ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE:

   THE TERRORIST HORDES OF THE FARBUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN) HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE ARMED FORCES, WHO HAVE
GONE OUT TO DEFEND OUR SOVEREIGNTY, INTEGRITY, AND THE LIVES AND
PROPERTIES OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THEIR ARMED FORCES AND
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   AT THIS TIME, THE FMLN CRIMINALS ARE RECEIVING THE PUNISHEMENT THEY
DESERVE THROUGH THE GLORIOUS WEAPONS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.

   THE COWARDLY FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN HIDING SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN THE HOMES OF DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS.  THEY ARE COWARDS.
THEY ARE LIKE THOSE COWARD CRIMINALS WHO AFTER COMMITTING MURDER RUN
TO HIDE BEHIND A WOMAN'S SKIRT.  THAT IS WHAT THOSE TERRORISTS ARE
DOING.  THEY ARE HIDING UNDER THE BEDS OF THE POPULATION, WHICH IS
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE TERRORISTS' ATTACKS.  THEY ARE COWARDS WHO
HAVE TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED AND BOMBED THE PEOPLE.

   A FEW HOURS AGO, THE LIAR TERRORIST JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, FROM HIS
HOTEL ROOM IN MANAGUA -- WHERE HE HAS AIR CONDITIONING AND LOTS OF
FOOD -- SAID THAT THE FMLN HAS SEIZED POSITIONS, WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
ALL TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL CONTROL
AND UNDER THE ARMED FORCES' MILITARY CONTROL.

   WE MUST INFORM YOU THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AREAS WHERE TERRORISTS
HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HOUSES AND ARE ACTING AS SNIPERS.  HOWEVER, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE TRYING TO DISLODGE THEM IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER IN
ORDER NOT TO HARM CIVILIANS.

   THE COWARDS ARE HIDING IN A FEW AREAS.  WE MUST TELL YOU THAT THE
AREAS WHERE THERE IS SOME RESISTANCE ARE ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA
LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD
DELGADO.

   SALVADORANS WHO ARE IN THOSE AREAS, VICTIMS OF THE TERRORISTS: FROM
HERE YOUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS, YOUR BROTHERS IN THE ARMED FORCES, TELL
YOU THAT WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE AT THIS TIME OF STRUGGLE, DURING THIS SAD
TIME WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH HUNGER AND DEATH THREATS BY THE FMLN
TERRORIST HORDES.  WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE, COMPATRIOT!  WE ARE WITH YOU
SALVADORAN PEOPLE!  YOUR ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ABANDON YOU.  YOU CAN
BE SURE THAT ALL THIS WILL SOON BE OVER.  WE WILL SOON DISLODGE THESE
MANGY DOGS WHO HAVE COME WITH [NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL]
ORTEGA'S WEAPONS AND TERRORIST HORDES, WHO HAVE COME HERE TO MASSACRE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ARE WITH YOU COMPATRIOT!  STAY WHERE YOU
ARE.  REMAIN CALM, AS YOU WILL SOON BE FREED FROM THE TERRORIST
HORDES.

   ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL,
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD DELGADO: REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND
CRISTIANI ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT YOUR ARMED
FORCES ARE UNITEDLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND PATRIOTICALLY STRUGGLING TO
DEFEND YOU FROM THIS BRUTAL AND BESTIAL ATTACK THAT WE DENOUNCE BEFORE
THE WORLD.

   WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING?  WHY DO JOURNALISTS IN EUROPE
SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING?  WHY DO THEY NOT TELL THE TRUTH?
THEY ONLY REPEAT THE LIES OF RADIO VENCEREMOS AND THE LIAR RADIO
FARABUNDO MARTI.  THE PEOPLE'S TRUTH IS HERE.  HERE IS THE TRUTH OF
OUR PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ENDURED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS FOR 10 YEARS!

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: BE BRAVE AND UNITED, FULL OF PATRIOTISM, AND
SURE OF OUR VICTORY.  OUR FATHERLAND IS FREE!  OUR ARMED FORCES ARE
GLORIOUSLY FIGHTING!  FORWARD, ARMED FORCES!  FORWARD, SALVADORAN
PEOPLE!

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION, THIS IS A
LAST-MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR: OUR FORCES HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS
HELD BY THE NATIONAL POLICE IN CUSCATANCINGO.  THE POLICEMEN WERE FORCED TO
FLEE IN DISARRARY FROM A POSITION THAT THEY HAD HELD IN CUSCATANCINGO,
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   MEANWHILE, THE ENEMY IS USING M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN DOWNTOWN
MEJICANOS.  THE MARKET AREA AND THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.

   WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL POLICE POSITION WAS ATTACKED BETWEEN 1310 AND
1350 [1910 AND 1950 GMT].  THE POLICEMEN, WHO ARE EXCELLENT AT
REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS, FLED
CUSCATANCINGO IN DISARRAY AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT FORCES.

   AT 1407 [2007 GMT], AN A-37 DRAGONFLY PLANE OVERFLEW AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL.  OUR FIGHTERS ARE TRAINED TO FIRE AT THESE
PLANES.  THIRTY MINUTES AGO, A PUSH-AND-PULL 0-2 PLANE DROPPED BOMBS
ON ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD AND A C-47 MACHINEGUNNED THE AREA.

   AN A-37 PLANE IS NOW OVERFLYING NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER OUR
COMRADES OCCUPIED A POSITION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAD HELD IN
CUSCATANCINGO.  


DEV-MUC3-0742 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] POLITICAL AND
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES TODAY REVEALED THAT THE GUERRILLAS TRIED TO KIDNAP
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE
RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT ON 11 NOVEMBER WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE LARGEST
MILITARY OFFENSIVE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS.

   A NEIGHBOR OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE LUXURIOUS RESIDENTIAL AREA OF
"MAQUILISHUAT," IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SAID THAT "THE GUERRILLAS
MANAGED TO ENTER PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT COULD NOT KIDNAP HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT THERE."

   LEADERS OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) HAVE
CONFIRMED THAT GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) HAD PLANNED TO KIDNAP PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "BUT WE DO NOT
KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE."

   A RANKING OFFICIAL TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT "WE HAVE AGREED THAT IN THE
EVENT OF A KIDNAPPING THERE WOULD BE NO RESCUE."

   "EVER SINCE WE WERE INSTALLED IN GOVERNMENT WE KNEW THAT WE COULD
END UP ON THE FLOOR (DEAD)," SAID AN OFFICIAL WHO ASKED TO REMAIN
ANONYMOUS.

   DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES ARE ALSO COMMENTING ON REPORTS REGARDING THE
KIDNAPPING OF CRISTIANI AND TOP GOVERNMENT LEADERS.  THEY CONFIRMED TO
ACAN - EFE THAT THE GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE WERE
WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   SOME SOURCES MAINTAIN THAT THE DISGUISED GUERRILLAS SUBDUED
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE GUARDS AND ENTERED CRISTIANI'S HOME, BUT
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES WERE THERE.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT ASSURE THAT CRISTIANI, HIS WIFE
MARGARITA, AND OTHER RELATIVES WERE AT A COUNTRYSIDE HOME IN
"COATEPEQUE LAKE," HOWEVER, THIS CLAIM COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.

   MOST MINISTERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE RESTING AT COUNTRYSIDE
HOMES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, BUT CONGRESS PRESIDENT
RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO ANGULO WERE IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE HOMES WHEN THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED AND BOTH OF THEM FOUGHT
BACK WITH THEIR WEAPONS.

   THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OFFENSIVE
WHICH INCLUDED ATTACKS AT MORE THAN 50 POINTS NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY
ARMY POSITIONS.  THESE ATTACKS HAVE YIELDED ABOUT 1,000 CASUALTIES
AMONG CIVILIANS, REBELS, AND SOLDIERS.

   SOME SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE RESIDENCE OF JULIO ADOLFO REY PRENDES,
LEADER OF THE AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT (MAC), WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY
THE GUERRILLAS, BUT THIS REPORT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.

   FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS, ESPECIALLY IN
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHEAST SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
REBELS ARE ENTRENCHED, CONTINUES THREE DAYS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN.

   COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FMLN LEADERS,
ANNOUNCED THAT 7 OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS WERE DECLARED "FREED
ZONES."

   THE REBELS MAINTAIN THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS DESIGNED TO BRING THE
GOVERNMENT AND FMLN "TO AN EQUAL FOOTING" IN SEEKING A NEGOTIATED
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR CONFLICT.

   A GUERRILLA WHO WAS INTERVIEWED BY ACAN - EFE IN A SAN SALVADOR
NEIGHBORHOOD SAID THAT "THE OFFENSIVE AIMS TO TOPPLE PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI AND DESTROY THE FASCIST REPRESSIVE PLAN."

   SOME DIPLOMATS MAINTAIN THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY HAD BEEN
EXPECTING THIS OFFENSIVE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT UNDERESTIMATED IT,
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO OR THREE VIOLENT
OUTBREAKS AND NOT A NATIONWIDE LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE SUCH AS THE ONE
THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   "WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW THE GUERRILLAS MANAGED TO REACH
CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE," A SOURCE SAID.  


DEV-MUC3-0743 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE
"LIBERATED TERRITORIES" IN THE COUNTRY, AS WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE
CLANDESTINE "RADIO VENCEREMOS."  HE ALSO DENIED THE REPORT THAT THE
ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN TOWNSHIPS.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THERE IS "A TRIANGLE"
CONSISTING OF PANAMANIAN GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA, NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERSATION
FRONT (FMLN) INVOLVED IN THE REBEL OFFENSIVE, BUT SAID HE COULD NOT
SUPPLY ANY MORE DETAILS.

   THE PRESIDENT STATED THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
CONTROLLED, BUT ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE STILL REBEL "REDOUBTS" IN
DENSELY POPULATED ZONES.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, WHO HELD HIS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE
THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE ADVANCING
SLOWLY BUT SURELY "SO AS NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[INTERVIEW WITH MERCEDES DEL CARMEN LETONA, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDER, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] U.S.  PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HYPOCRITICALLY REGRETTED TODAY
THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS TURNED
THE REGION'S PEACE AGREEMENTS INTO A SENSELESS BLOODBATH WITH THE
OFFENSIVE IT LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.  WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?

   [LETONA] I WOULD SAY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S REMARKS ARE VERY
CYNICAL.  HE SAID THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION WAS BEING SOUGHT IN
CENTRAL AMERICA AND WITH THIS ACTION, WE HAD BROKEN THE POLITICAL PATH
AND SOUGHT OTHER OPTIONS.  I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE PATH ARE
THE UNITED STATES.  WE MUST RECALL THAT WHILE WE WERE HOLDING TALKS IN
SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA AND DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF LA TANDONA [NAME
GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY
ACADEMY] AND DEMANDING JUSTICE AGAINST THE DEATH SQUADS IN
ORDER TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT APPROVED MORE AID FOR THE FASCIST SECTORS, THE VERY
SECTORS THAT WERE IN FACT REPRESSING THE PEOPLE AND CARRYING OUT SUCH
DRAMATIC AND HORRIBLE ACTIONS AS THE ONE PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
BUILDING.  THESE ACTIONS CONTINUE AND HAVE BEEN REPEATED EVERY DAY IN
EL SALVADOR.

   THEREFORE, THE FIRST ONES TO BURY THE POLITICAL POSSIBILITY WERE
THE UNITED STATES.  THE FIRST ONES TO GIVE WEAPONS TO THE FASCISTS TO
CONTINUE KILLING PEOPLE WERE THE UNITED STATES.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
CANNOT WAIT FOR THE FASCISTS TO KILL THEM ALL.  THAT IS NO WAY TO
ATTAIN PEACE, MUCH LESS DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHAT THE
UNITED STATES DID.  RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ARE INVOLVED IN AN OFFENSIVE,
WHO ARE THE ONES GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AGAINST THE PEOPLE?  THE UNITED
STATES.  THOSE BOMBS AND THOSE ROCKETS THAT ARE FALLING ON CIVILIANS
ARE BOMBS AND ROCKETS PROVIDED BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THE ONES WHO HAVE BLOCKED THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE AND NEGOTIATION
IN EL SALVADOR ARE THE UNITED STATES.  WE WANTED TO REMOVE LA TANDONA
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S DEATH SQUADS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS BUT THAT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE.  SO, WE ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE COMBAT OF OUR FORCES AND
WITH THE COOPERATION OF ALL THE PEOPLE.  


DEV-MUC3-0745 (U NEBRASKA)

   MANAGUA, 14 NOV (DPA) -- [TEXT] A LEADER OF THE INSURRECTIONAL
MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR TODAY SAID IN MANAGUA THAT THE MILITARY
CAMPAIGN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST ARMY
TROOPS ON VARIOUS FRONTS AIMS TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR
A "GENUINE DIALOGUE" WITH GUARANTEES FOR THE PEOPLE.

   COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) POLITICAL COMMISSION, SAID THAT THE REBELS
HAVE ORDERS TO "ADVANCE" AND CONTROL THE "FREED ZONES" AS PART OF ITS
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ARMY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S "FASCIST GOVERNMENT,
WHICH IS MAINTAINING A SOCIALLY UNJUST REGIME.

   LOPEZ, WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS "COMMANDER VENANCIO SALVATIERRA," SAID
THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HAS USED MORE THAN 15 AIRCRAFTS TO BOMB
CIVILIANS IN SOYAPANGO, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, AND
NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN MIGUEL, CAUSING SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND
KILLING CIVILIANS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER POINTED OUT THAT THE FMLN MILITARY
CAMPAIGN, WHICH BEGAN WITH NATIONWIDE ATTACKS ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAS
ENJOYED "POPULAR SUPPORT" WHICH MAKES IT "AN INSURRECTION WHOSE SCOPE
IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE."

   HE ADDED THAT THIS REACTION MEANS THAT THE FMLN "CANNOT ALLOW BLOWS
AGAINST THE PEOPLE TO TAKE PLACE WITH IMPUNITY."

   "WE ARE SEEKING A CHANGE IN THE CORRELATION OF FORCES THAT WOULD
BRING ABOUT APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A GENUINE DIALOGUE," MARIO
LOPEZ POINTED OUT.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI
MUST "QUIT HOPING FOR A MILITARY VICTORY OVER THE FMLN."

   AS FOR EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, LOPEZ SAID THAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY
VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT THE GENOCIDAL ACTIONS OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  HE SAID THAT THE FMLN IS MAKING SUCH EFFORTS AT THE UNITED
NATIONS AND OAS WHERE NICARAGUA HAS PROPOSED A RESUMPTION OF
NEGOTIATIONS.

   HE ADDED THAT FOR THE TIME BEING, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE
ORGANIZING "POPULAR GOVERNMENTS" IN THE "FREED ZONES," HOWEVER, HE
SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE ETABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL FMLN GOVERNMENT.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT AN INTERVENTION BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY IN THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT, BY SUPPORTING THE CRISTIANI ARMY, "WOULD BE
DANGEROUS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA BECAUSE THE CONFLICT COULD BE SPREADED."
HE RECALLED THAT GUATEMALA IS FACING A GUERRILLA STRUGGLE WHICH IS
OLDER THAN THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR.

   LOPEZ DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS EXIST BECAUSE OF THE
USSR, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA AND ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE IS OLDER THAN THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT ITSELF (1979).  HE
ADDED THAT THE FMLN HAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN STRATEGIES AND EVEN ITS OWN
WEAPONS, HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT IT RECEIVES WEAPONS FROM ABROAD.
HE PROVIDED NO FUTHER DETAILS ON THE FMLN'S "OWN" WEAPONS.

1,500 FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS HAVE
BEEN FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL SINCE LAST SATURDAY.

   THE DEFENSE MINISTER DENIED THAT THE ARMY IS BOMBING CIVILIAN
AREAS, AS THE GUERRILLAS CHARGED TODAY.

   LARIOS ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAVE HIT "FOUR OR FIVE HELICOPTERS"
AND SEVERAL ARMY RADIO PATROL VEHICLES BUT ADDED THAT THEY HAVE NOT
DESTROYED ANY ARMORED VEHICLES.

   THE MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT THE ARMY IS NOT DROPPING HEAVY BOMBS
ON THE TOWNSHIPS IN WHICH GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN ORDER TO
"PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI DENIED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE
"LIBERATED TERRITORIES," AS THE FMLN ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   CLANDESTINE, 14 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) --
[STATEMENT] [GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] THE ARMY FAILED TODAY IN ITS ATTEMPT TO
RECOVER THE POSITIONS TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES ON 11 NOVEMBER IN THE
COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES.

   THE ENEMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE RESULTED IN MORE BLOODSHED AMONG ITS
RANKS.  THE ARMY SOWED TERROR AND DEATH AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
BY CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBINGS AGAINST
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN APOPA, THE HERMITA AND OBRERA
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE CEMETERY AREA, THE SANTA ELENA NEIGHBORHOOD, THE
OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, LA ESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD, LA COQUERA AND EL
GRANILLO IN SAN MIGUEL, THE NORTHERN MAIN HIGHWAY, ZACATECOLUCA,
SOYAPANGO, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND ZACAMIL.

   IN MANY OF THESE PLACES, THE AIR RAIDS LASTED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY,
PRODUCING NUMEROUS CASUALTIES AMONG MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, AND
DESTROYING MANY HOUSES AND OTHER BUILDINGS.

   IN OVERCOMING THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE, WE HAVE MAINTAINED
ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF ALL OUR POSITIONS IN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY.

   WE HAVE INFLICTED THE FOLLOWING CUMULATIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY:
APPROXIMATELY 760 CASUALTIES, 24 ARMORED VEHICLES OUT OF COMBAT, AS
WELL AS 11 HELICOPTERS AND PLANES.

   SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE HAS BEEN TOTAL IN ALMOST
ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   ONLY 24 HOURS AFTER SUMMONING THE PEOPLE FOR A GENERAL REBELLION,
PEOPLE HAVE MASSIVELY JOINED IN THE TASKS OF COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT
OR HAVE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN COMBAT.

   THE DECREE DECLARING A 24-HOUR CURFEW IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN
SALVADOR SHOWS THAT WHAT THE ARMY IS FACING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS
NOT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] BUT
THE PEOPLE'S GROWING REBELLION.

   OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS HAVE RESPONDED WITH THE USUAL VIGOR AND
EFFICIENCY TO THE ORDER GIVEN BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND TO HOLD THE
POSITIONS CONQUERED AND IMMEDIATELY ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE'S GENERAL
UPRISING.

   OUT WITH THE FASCISTS; FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] OFFICIALS REPORTED
THAT 220 TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22 CAPTURED DURING THE
CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS OUTSKIRTS.

   AMONG THE WAR MATERIEL CONFISCATED: A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, 140
HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES, 6 LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, AND MACHINEGUNS.

   AN ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE COPREFA SPOKESMAN STATED THAT THEY
WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO RELEASE ANY OFFICIAL INFORMATION ON THE 11, 12,
AND 13 NOVEMBER EVENTS.

   MILITARY SOURCES WHO WERE QUESTIONED STATED THAT ACCORDING TO
INITIAL REPORTS--REPORTS WHICH ARE UNOFFICIAL AND COVER ONLY UP TO THE
AFTERNOON OF 13 NOVEMBER--RECEIVED FROM SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT AGAINST
THE EXTREMISTS POSITIONED AT THE EL SALVADOR UNIVERSITY, THE
TERRORISTS SUFFERED MORE THAN 400 CASUALTIES. THESE CASUALTIES WERE
DISTRIBUTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: 220 KILLED, 196 WOUNDED, AND 22
CAPTURED.

   THE CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL INCLUDED A SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO- AIR
MISSILE--CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT CATCH; 140 HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES
INCLUDING 74 AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES, LAW ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 2 M- 79
GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 3 UZI MACHINEGUNS, 50 GRENADES, 2 DRAGUNOV RIFLES
FOR SNIPERS, AND 38 BLASTING CAPS, APPROXIMATELY 1000 M-16 CARTRIDGES;
AND 136 AK-47 CARTRIDGES.

   ALSO CONFISCATED WERE FOUR KNAPSACKS CONTAINING CLOTHING AND
COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA, FIVE TNT BLOCKS, TWO OLIVE-GREEN UNIFORMS, AND
MATERIAL TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES.

   OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT THE CONFISCATED SOVIET MISSILE WAS PART OF
A 15-MISSILE LOT THAT ENTERED SALVADORAN TERRITORY FROM NICARAGUA AND
THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN STORED IN PERQUIN, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT.

   THE SOURCE ADDED THAT IT WAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED WEAPON AND THAT
ITS PRESENCE IN SALVADORAN TERRITORY CONFIRMS THAT ONCE AGAIN THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED WEAPONS TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]. THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO
SUPPLY WEAPONS DESPITE THE PROMISE MADE BY PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA AT
TELA, HONDURAS THAT HIS REGIME WOULD NO LONGER SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE
SALVADORAN TERRORIST GROUPS.


DEV-MUC3-0749 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING, SALVADORAN PEOPLE--IF I MAY
SAY, SO DESPITE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE CAPITAL CITY. IT IS
REGRETTABLE AND INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SHOULD PERSIST WITH THE AGGRESSION IT HAS
UNLEASHED AGAINST OUR CAPITAL CITY AND SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES.
OUR POPULATION HAS SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THIS FMLN AGGRESSION.

   THIS AGGRESSION, SALVADORAN FRIENDS, MUST BE SEEN AS AN ACT OF
DESPERATION BY THE FMLN, AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN THEIR
IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. I HAVE USED THE WORD DESPERATION BECAUSE THE FMLN
KNOWS THAT IT IS OUT OF STYLE AND THAT ITS ATTITUDES ARE NO LONGER
ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD. WE CAN SEE IN EUROPE THAT COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED
FROM TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO
IMPLEMENT HERE, AND WALLS ARE OPEN FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY.

   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT: LIBERTY
AND DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NEVER
SUPPORT THE FMLN TERRORISTS WHO WANT TO SUBJECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
TO TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, TO DICTATORSHIPS OF OPPRESSION, REPRESSION,
AND VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

   I WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS A DESPERATE ACT BECAUSE WE CANNOT SEE HOW
ANYONE WHO IS NOT DESPERATE COULD CAUSE SO MUCH HARM TO INNOCENT
PEOPLE AND TO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THERE ARE ALREADY MORE THAN 100
DEAD OR WOUNDED BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS. OF COURSE,
TO THAT WE MUST ADD THAT THEY DESTROYED MANY HOMES WHICH THEY ENTERED
AND HAVE HELD FAMILIES AS HOSTAGES. THEY HAVE DAMAGED THE ELECTRICITY,
POTABLE WATER, AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, DEPRIVING THE POPULATION OF
THOSE ESSENTIAL SERVICES, NOT TO MENTION THE LACK OF FOOD AFFECTING
THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE HOLDING HOSTAGES.

   IN ADDITION, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SEE HOW FAR THE FMLN TERRORISTS'
IRRATIONAL MINDS CAN GO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTS OF
SAVAGERY THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND. HOW CAN THERE STILL BE ANYONE LIKE
THE NICARAGUANS--AND I AM TALKING ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, OF
COURSE, NOT ALL NICARAGUANS--AND THE CUBANS, WHO SUPPORT SUCH ACTS OF
SAVAGERY.

   HOLDING CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES, PUTTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT
THEY WILL BE THE ONES WHO ARE HURT, AND SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND
INNOCENT PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   TAKING OVER A CENTER FOR ORPHAN CHILDREN IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THEMSELVES BEHIND LITTLE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE A FATHER OR A MOTHER
IS AN ACT OF SAVAGERY, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THEY EVEN DID SOMETHING WORSE AT THE ZACATECOLUCA HOSPITAL AND THE
PEOPLE WITNESSED THIS. WHEN THEY ENTERED THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA,
THEY MURDERED, AT GUNPOINT, A SOLDIER WHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL
ATTENTION; THEY PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND THEN FLED.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THE FMLN IS ALREADY A DESPERATE BEAST. THIS IS
 THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY ABOUT SUCH IRRATIONAL MINDS. HOWEVER, WE
MUST REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND, AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THAT THE
MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE REPUDIATE THE FMLN TERRORISTS.                    

   THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR ARMED FORCES
WHICH HAVE ADVANCED SLOWLY, BUT SURELY. IT IS ADVANCING SLOWLY BECAUSE
IT WANTS TO FULLY PROTECT THE LIVES OF CIVILIANS. THE ARMED FORCES
COULD DRIVE THOSE TERRORISTS OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE
CIVILIANS THERE, AND WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO EXPOSE THOSE CIVILIANS TO
THE DANGER THE FMLN IS TRYING TO LEAD THEM INTO.  THE ARMED FORCES
HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE. THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED, USING
PROFESSIONAL MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS BOSQUES DEL RIO
ARE TOTALLY CALM NOW, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALREADY ENTERED
AND FORCED THE TERRORISTS OUT. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SEE AN END TO THIS TERROR THAT THE FMLN WANTS TO CREATE. HOWEVER, WE
MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AS
ANGUISHED AT THIS MOMENT AS THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BECOME FMLN
HOSTAGES. THEY TOO, DESERVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE
OUR OBJECTIVE; HOWEVER, WE MUST DO SO RESPECTING THE LIVES OF THOSE
INNOCENT PEOPLE. THE FMLN FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE.  [CONTINUED]

   HAVANA (CUBA), 15 NOV 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [EXCERPTS]
COMMANDER IN CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
OF CUBA AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILS OF STATE AND MINISTERS, LAST NIGHT
GRANTED AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO OUR REPORTER, OSCAR SUAREZ, AT THE
INAUGURATION OF THE MADRID RESTAURANT IN HABANA VIEJA. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASTRO] TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY.  TODAY, WHEN
WE ARE COMMEMORATING THE 470TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAVANA, WE RECEIVED THE
NEWS OF THE CRUSHING TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S
ORGANIZATION IN THE NAMIBIAN ELECTIONS BY 57 PERCENT. IT IS A VERY
GOOD PERCENTAGE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO RECEIVED THE NEWS....[REPHRASES] WE
ADMIRE THE HEROISM WITH WHICH THE SALVADORANS ARE FIGHTING.  IT IS
SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE.  IT IS A LIKE A LESSON TO IMPERIALISM WHICH
IS EUPHORIC AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS AT ITS FEET. THEY THINK
THAT...

   [SUAREZ, INTERRUPTING] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

   [CASTRO] I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY
CARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER
BEEN WRITTEN.  DESPITE THE 10 YEARS [OF STRUGGLE], THE
BILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS,
NOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT.  NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE.  HOW
ARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES?  THEY ARE BEING USED TO
MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE
HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS
SOMETHING REPUGNANT.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE
DOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE.  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE
IMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM.  THEIR
ACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING
WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

   [SUAREZ] COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE
HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS?  WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A
MIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN.

   [CASTRO] I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED
A POLICY OF PRINCIPLE.  I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE
TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS,
THE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION.
NOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS
SOMETHING ELSE.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  [WORD
INDISTINCT] REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY.  HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY
DOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP.  THERE COULD BE
CONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP.  FRIENDSHIP IS MORE
A RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY.

   [SUREZ] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT...

   [CASTRO] THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A
BASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD.  I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN
RECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE
HAVE.  I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE
YANKEE PRESSURES.  THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS,
INTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS.  THIS SAYS A LOT.  THE YANKEES WANTED TO
BURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN.
HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.  THAT IS WHY UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY
THAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US.  ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS.
WE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE.  WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD.  WE
ARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN.  THAT MIXTURE HAS
TURNED OUT TO BE VERY GOOD.

   AN "A-37" SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANE FLEW OVER THE AREA AND STRAFED
CERTAIN POINTS, WHILE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS WENT THROUGH THE

TRAPPED ON ONE OF THE MAIN STREETS OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA.

IN ZACAMIL FAILED.

   AT 0400 TODAY, AN IMPORTANT BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN ZACAMIL.  COMBINED

WITH THE SUPPORT OF ONE HELICOPTER AND ONE OR TWO LIGHT PLANES, TRIED

FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE MANUEL PACAS CASTRO TODAY CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HE
BLAMED THE ULTRALEFTIST GROUPS FOR IT, ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE HAD NO
PROOF.

   "IT IS A REPUGNANT CRIME," SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO WAS
ATTENDING THE 19TH OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND HE DESCRIBED THE
ASSASSINATIONS AS A "DESPERATE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEFT."

   JOAO BAENA SOARES, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OAS, WAS ASKED TODAY TO
REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE RESOLUTION ON THAT COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROVED ON TUESDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON BLAMED THE SALVADORAN
ARMY FOR THE CRIME, AND ADDED THAT "ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BULLET
WOUNDS IN THE HEAD, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EXECUTED."

   PACAS CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO A DIALOGUE TO
DISCUSS THE SUSPENSION OF THE HOSTILITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNAL
PEACE PROCESS.

   MOREOVER, HE ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL MISSION, CAPABLE OF MAKING
DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS, WILL TRAVEL TO CARACAS IN THE HOPE OF
MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GUERRILLAS.

   THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE SITUATION IN HIS COUNTRY
IS UNDER CONTROL AND THAT ARMY TROOPS ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS TO AVOID BLOODSHED AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   AS FOR A REQUEST BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO CALL FOR A
CEASE-FIRE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO TREAT THE WOUNDED AND CIVILIAN
VICTIMS, PACAS CASTRO SAID THAT THE FIRST-AID BRIGADES CONTINUE TO DO
THEIR WORK IN EL SALVADOR.

   AS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, HE
SAID "HE CONDEMNED THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE" BECAUSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
ONE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WAS KILLED, "WAS MY TEACHER," AND HE
DESCRIBED THE PRIEST AS A VERY VALUABLE MAN WHO WORKED FOR PEACE AND
FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION.

   COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO, IN STATEMENTS
TO THE PRESS, REGRETTED THE DEATH OF THE CLERGYMEN.  "WORKING FOR
PEACE IS VERY DIFFICULT," HE SAID.

   MADRIGAL NIETO SAID TODAY HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS WOULD CONTINUE DESPITE THE WAR.

   GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL RIVERA IRIAS SUPPORTED THE
STATEMENTS OF HIS COSTA RICAN COLLEAGUE, AND HE CONDEMNED THE USE OF
VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL TOOL.

   1.  IT WAS LEARNED THROUGH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES THAT THERE
WERE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN U.S. PENTAGON ADVISERS AND THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF ON THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE PILOTS.

   2. AS A RESULT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS, ON 13 NOVEMBER, U.S. COMBAT
PILOTS ARRIVED AT THE ILOPANGO AIR FORCE BASE FROM HONDURAS.

   3.  IN THE PAST 48 HOURS, THESE U.S. PILOTS HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT
THE BOMBING MISSIONS IN SAN SALVADOR.  NIGHT BOMBINGS ARE CARRIED OUT
EXCLUSIVELY BY THESE YANKEE PILOTS, AND THEY ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE INFLICTED AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   4. ON 15 NOVEMBER, [WORD INDISTINCT] COMPANY TROOPS FROM GUATEMALA
ARRIVED IN OUR COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE BY THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION TO GET REGIONAL ARMIES TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN
WAR.

   THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS THAT
COULD LEAD TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT TO THE REST OF
THE REGION.  WE CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, PARTICULARLY,
ON THE U.S. PUBLIC TO DENOUNCE BEFORE THE WORLD THE ESCALATION OF THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR.  WE WARN THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE DANGER OF THIS ESCALATION AND THAT
WE WILL NOT BE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF NORTH AMERICANS

AWARE THAT THIS U.S. INTERVENTION HARMS THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA
ACCORDS AND CONSTITUTES A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE REGION'S PROCESS OF

[COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] IN VIEW OF THE SINISTER MASSACRE OF
JESUIT PRIESTS TODAY, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE:

   1.  THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO
MONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN
RAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA
RAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY.

   A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS'
RESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER
WEAPONS.  THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY
WERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS.

   2.  THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY
POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF
A COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE
A STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS
WERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES
NATIONAL NETWORK.

   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED
THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER
TO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN
THEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA [NATIONALIST
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
FASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN
UNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE
THE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF
EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --
TO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.

   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO
NOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT
TOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES
ASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST
APPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND
SENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR
SOCIETY.  THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY
WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK.

   WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN
GENERAL, TO UNTIRING COMBAT.  THIS STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY ANSWER WE HAVE
FOR THIS DESPICABLE MASSACRE.  WE MUST OUST ARENA AND LA TANDONA [1966

FATHERLAND IS COUNTING ON OUR STRENGTH AND OUR DETERMINATION, AND WE
WILL NOT FAIL THE FATHERLAND.

SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS AND THE CONSTANT AIR FORCE BOMBINGS
OF POPULATED AREAS CONTINUED FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY TODAY, WHILE
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS FLED FROM THE MAIN AREAS OF FIGHTING.

   IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS, EFE
REPORTERS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE PERSISTENT CLASHES AND CONTINUOUS
LAUNCHING OF ROCKETS BY AIR FORCE PUSH AND PULL AIRCRAFT AGAINST THE
REBEL POSITIONS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS.

   AT LEAST TWO BLOCKS OF HOMES IN LOW-INCOME ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD
HAVE BEEN ABLAZE SINCE MID-MORNING AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY, WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 600 DEAD AND 1,000
WOUNDED.

   THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND
CUSCATANCINGO ARE THE PRINCIPAL AREAS OF FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL WHERE, ACCORDING TO ARMY SOURCES, THE MILITARY HAVE "LAID
SIEGE TO THE REBELS AND WILL EVICT THEM IN A FEW HOURS."

   THE SALVADORAN ARMY, SUPPORTED BY AIRCRAFT AND ARTILLERY, ARE
ATTACKING THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 300,000 PERSONS LIVE
AND WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE TAKEN UP POSITIONS.

   FOR THEIR PART, SPOKESMEN FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), ENTRENCHED IN BUILDINGS AND BEHIND BARRICADES
IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS CLAIM THAT THEY "WILL NOT RETREAT"
AND THAT "THEY HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND
OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY."

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, FIGHTING IS UNDER WAY IN AT LEAST 7 OF THE
24 DEPARTMENTS OF EL SALVADOR, WHILE THE FIERCEST CLASHES ARE TAKING
PLACE IN USULUTAN, LA PAZ, SAN MIGUEL, AND MORAZAN IN THE EASTERN PART
OF THE COUNTRY.

   INDEPENDENT CIVILIAN SOURCES REPORTED THAT IN THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN
DEPARTMENT OF SAN MIGUEL THE GUERRILLAS HAVE OCCUPIED POSITIONS IN
VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE UNDER HEAVY AIR AND ARTILLERY FIRE.

   HOWEVER, THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM THAT THE SITUATION IS
UNDER CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THAT "THERE ARE GUERRILLA
REDOUBTS" IN SAN SALVADOR ONLY.

   MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES
ARE TAKING PLACE ARE SEEN RUNNING TERRIFIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN
SALVADOR SEEKING PLACES OF REFUGE.

   THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- MEN AND WOMEN WITH CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS --
CAN BE SEEN CARRYING A FEW BELONGINGS AND HOLDING WHITE FLAGS AS THEY
WALK TO SHELTERS OPENED BY VARIOUS CHURCHES, WHERE THEY RECEIVE FOOD
AND MEDICINE.

   THE PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS "IS VERY
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES.

   THE EXODUS OF SALVADORANS HAS GROWN EVEN MORE IN VIEW OF THE STRICT
SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE
STATE OF SIEGE AND THE 24-HOUR CURFEW ENFORCED IN THE DEPARTMENTS
WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AND 12 HOURS IN THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY.

   SO FAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES AS A RESULT OF CLASHES AND THE BOMBINGS THAT TOOK PLACE
LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING.

   THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE DUE TO THE HEAVY
FIGHTING, AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REJECTED A PROPOSAL FOR A TEMPORARY
TRUCE TO EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND PERMIT THE BURIAL OF BODIES STILL
LAYING IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.

   GUARDADO, WEARING AN OLIVE GREEN UNIFORM, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE
GUERRILLAS' OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, SURPRISED THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS "MOTIVATED WARMONGERING
SECTORS IN THIS COUNTRY TO CONTINUE REPRESSION."

   THE GUERRILLA LEADER, KNOWN AS "ESTEBAN," SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR FROM
HERE [SAN SALVADOR], WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THESE TERRITORIES (IN
SAN SALVADOR)."  HE ADDED: "WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK ARMY CHIEFS IF THESE
ARE THE SO-CALLED UNDELIMITED BORDER AREAS BORDERING HONDURAS."

   THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAS REPEATEDLY CHARGED THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) WITH SEEKING REFUGE IN "UNDELIMITED
BORDER AREAS" IN DISPUTE WITH HONDURAS.

   GUARDADO WAS INTERVIEWED NEAR A CLINIC IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS OF THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE'S "INDISCRIMINATE" BOMBINGS.

   "WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE OUR HOMES.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO
DO.  WE ASK YOU (THE PRESS) TO REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS," A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING A WHITE FLAG AND SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO HIS NEIGHBORS SAID.

   THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED TO THE PRESS TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE
DETAINED ON 15 NOVEMBER AS SOLDIERS TRIED TO EXPEL REBELS FROM
MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE
SOLDIERS, APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS OLD, IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS JOSE
FRANCISCO RAMIREZ AND SANTOS LOPEZ.  "WE WERE CAPTURED YESTERDAY.  WE
WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVE BEEN FED.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRISONERS OF WAR," RAMIREZ SAID.  LOPEZ SAID HE HAD ENTERED THE
MEJICANOS AREA WITH 45 OTHER SOLDIERS, BUT "ALL OF THEM LEFT."

EARLY THIS MORNING AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO "GROUPS OR MINDS THAT WANT TO
HINDER THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN
EL SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS DETERMINED "TO INVESTIGATE THIS TO THE
VERY END, REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT."

   HE EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS TOO EARLY "TO GIVE ANY OPINION" ON WHO
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE MURDERS, POINTING OUT THAT THE FACT THE MEN
WHO DID IT WERE WEARING UNIFORMS AND WERE MOVING AT NIGHT DURING THE
STRICT CURFEW IN THE CITY "IS NOT CONCLUSIVE."

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS MOVE DURING THE CURFEW HOURS."

   HE STATED THAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF,
WITH WHOM HE MET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE, HE HAS ORDERED AN
INVESTIGATION.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT DISCLOSED THE EXISTENCE OF "A POSSIBLE
WITNESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN INTERROGATED BY THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING OUT
THE INVESTIGATION" AND WHO HAVE FINGERPRINTS AND EMPTY CARTRIDGES OF
BULLETS FOR AK-47S AND M-16S.

   CRISTIANI DISAVOWED VERSIONS REPORTED DURING THE DAY BY THE
GOVERNMENT RADIO NETWORK THAT CLAIM THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS COMMITTED THE MURDER.

   IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ADMITTED THAT WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES "THERE MIGHT GROUPS OF PERSONS
WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT," BUT HE ADDED THAT "AS AN
INSTITUTION, THEY ARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT."


DEV-MUC3-0767 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI STATED TODAY HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO CONTINUE
THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, BUT ONLY IF IT DESISTS FROM VIOLENCE
AND JOINS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO ANY GAME WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  WHILE
SPEAKING OF PEACE, THEY PREPARED THIS ACTION" (THE OFFENSIVE),
CRISTIANI STATED, NOTING THAT THE REBELS "ARE GOING TO ANY LENGTH TO
TRY TO ACHIEVE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS."

   "IF HOSTILITIES DO NOT CEASE ON THE PART OF THE GUERRILLAS, THERE
WILL NOT BE ANY DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LEND ITSELF TO THIS
GAME," HE INSISTED.

   THE PRESIDENT STATED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE ARMY "HAS
CONTROLLED" NATIONAL TERRITORY, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT IN SOME
PLACES, ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, CLASHES ARE STILL
TAKING PLACE WITH THE REBELS.

   CRISTIANI STATED THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS "IS VERY
DISTURBED AND TERMED THE REBELS CYNICAL," BECAUSE WHILE THEY SPOKE OF
PEACE THEY WERE PREPARING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON SATURDAY.

   THE PRESIDENT AGAIN DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE IS
INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE SAID THAT ONLY
TWICE HAVE BOMBS BEEN USED, THE FIRST TIME IN AN OPEN FIELD OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF EL SALVADOR WHERE MORTARS WERE POSITIONED, AND AGAIN
LAST NIGHT IN THE VICINITY OUTSIDE THE AIR FORCE GARRISONS.

   CRISTIANI STATED THAT THE GUERRILLAS USED BOMBS LAST NIGHT AGAINST
THE AIR FORCE IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AND WERE REPELLED BY AIRCRAFT
WHICH DROPPED BOMBS.

   THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT THE ARMY HAS NOT EVICTED THE GUERRILLAS
FROM POSITIONS IN THE NORTHWESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR SO AS
"NOT TO AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   HE ADDED THAT FRANCE AND GUATEMALA HAVE OFFERED TO DONATE MEDICINE
FOR THE THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AS
A RESULT OF THE INTENSE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS SINCE
THE OFFENSIVE BEGAN, CAUSING APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEATHS.


DEV-MUC3-0768 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CRISTIANI] FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  BRIEFLY,
BEFORE BEGINNING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY
BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS THAT WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST TERMS
THE MURDERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEIR COOK, AND HER DAUGHTER EARLY
THIS MORNING AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, UCA.  WE FEEL THAT
THESE INCIDENTS FURTHER COMPLICATE OUR COUNTRY'S CRITICAL SITUATION.
GROUPS OR MINDS WANT TO HAMPER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE
PEACE PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TRIED TO ADVANCE
AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE.

   FROM THE START WE ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT
NOW THAT THE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS HAVE
SUPPORTED THE PEACE PROCESS, IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE
HAVING THESE SAVAGE INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE THAT ARE AIMED AT BLOCKING
THIS PROCESS.  WE HAVE MADE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT MERELY
TELL US HOW THINGS HAPPENED.  WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME PROCEDURAL
STEPS, SUCH AS [WORD INDISTINCT] WHERE THE IMPACT WAS FELT AND WHERE
THE CRIMES WERE PERPETRATED.  IN SUM, WE DID THE THINGS NORMALLY DONE
AT THE START OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS.

   THERE IS A POSSIBLE WITNESS TO THESE CRIMES, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, HE
HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED SO THAT HE CAN BE QUESTIONED BY THE
INVESTIGATORS.  THEY WILL CERTAINLY MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE HIM SO
THAT HE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE
INCIDENT.

   I SUPPOSE THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL WILL HOST A NEWS CONFERENCE.  YOU
HAVE MANY OF THE DETAILS, SO WE ARE GOING TO SKIP THEM.  THE ONLY
THINGS WE HAVE FOUND ARE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED AND SHELL
CASINGS FROM AK-47 AND M-16 RIFLES.  WE WILL SUBMIT THEM FOR BALLISTIC
TESTS.  WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT FORENSIC TESTS, WHICH WILL BEGIN SOON.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL IS THAT INSIDE THE BUILDING THERE WAS A ROOM
OR LIBRARY WITH VIDEO CASSETTES.  IT WAS LIKE A STUDIO.  THIS ROOM
LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AFTER BEING RANSACKED.  ALL THESE
THINGS AND OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE
INVESTIGATORS.  WE ALSO TALKED TO THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL AND TOLD HIM
THAT WE WERE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  WE ASKED HIM
FOR HIS HELP, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS TO ASSIST IN THE
INVESTIGATION.  WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS HELP BECAUSE IN THE PAST
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING.

   WE HOPE THAT WITH THIS HELP AND WITH THE REMARKS BY MSGR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS, WITH WHOM WE ALSO SPOKE THIS MORNING, THIS CASE WILL
NOT BE POLITICIZED AND JUSTICE CAN BE SERVED, AVOIDING REACHING HASTY
OR BIASED CONCLUSIONS BY ANY OF GROUP OR PARTY.  WE THINK AND AGREE
WITH MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS THAT THIS IS HOW A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION
SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.  WE HOPE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD US TO
THE HEART OF THE MATTER.  REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATORS ARE, WE
WANT PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HINDER THE PROCESS OF PEACE
AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

   AND SO WE BEGIN THE QUESTIONS.  PERHAPS MR SANDOVAL OR ANA MARIA
MAY WANTO HELP US TO PUT SOME ORDER [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REPEATS ECO [MEXICAN
NEWS AGENCY] ECO REPORTS, WHICH MENTION UNKNOWN TERRORISTS.
REGARDLESS OF THE SIDE THAT IS INVOLVED, THIS IS THE WAY TO DESCRIBE
THESE ACTIONS.  THESE ARE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL
CONTEXT, NO MATTER WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  LET ME REPEAT: WE HAVE
COMMENTS BY CHURCH OFFICIALS WHO WERE GIVING VERSIONS THAT HAVE NOT
BEEN CORROBORATED.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS
WEARING UNIFORMS, TO CITE THESE VERSIONS VERBATIM.  I DO NOT WANT TO
EXCUSE OR ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT I FEEL THAT IS NOT A CATEGORICAL PROOF.
TODAY, MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THE ARMED FORCES ARE WEARING
UNIFORMS.

   LET ME REPEAT: ONE CANNOT SAY ONE THING OR ANOTHER, BUT I DO THINK
THIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.  IF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE FOUND
TO BE INVOLVED, THEY WILL FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0769 (U NEBRASKA)

   PARIS (FRANCE), 16 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX MEMBERS OF HIS ORDER, INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), "ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
KILLED MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR."

   "I DO NOT WANT TO ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THE FACTS ARE
POINTING," JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA [JESUIT PROVINCIAL SUPERVISOR] STATED AT A
NEWS CONFERENCE HELD THIS AFTERNOON IN THE UCA CHAPEL, ONLY A FEW METERS
FROM WHERE THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTICS WERE KILLED THIS MORNING.

   THE BODIES OF ELLACURIA AND HIS JESUIT COMPANIONS IGNACIO MARTIN
BARO, SEGUNDO MONTES, JUAN RAMON MORENO, ARMANDO LOPEZ, AND JOAQUIN
LOPEZ, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ELBA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WERE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, WHILE SOME ALSO HAD THEIR SKILLS CRUSHED.

   THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE ALWAYS
IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, HAS INCREASED THE
FEAR AND DESPERATION FELT BY THE SALVADORANS SINCE THE PAST WEEKEND,
WHEN VIOLENT FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED BY SOME 30 MEN WEARING OLIVE DRAB UNIFORMS
WHO BROKE INTO THE PLACE, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE,
TOJEIRA EXPLAINED.

   THE PRIEST RECALLED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE GOVERNMENT RADIO
NETWORK "LAUNCHED FIERCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE [WORD INDISTINCT], SAYING
THAT A FEW PRIESTS HAD TO BE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY OR THAT THEY HAD
TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD KILL
THEM BY SPITTING AT THEM," TOJERA NOTED.

   ALSO, HE ADDED THAT ON MONDAY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS RAIDED THE HOMES
OF ELLACURIA AND COMPANIONS.  "ON THAT OCCASION THEY WERE QUITE
CORRECT, ACCORDING TO WHAT FATHER ELLACURIA TOLD ME," ADDED TOJEIRA,
WHO WAS QUITE UPSET DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

   "APPARENTLY THE MEN SAID THEY HAD REPORTS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS
IN THE RESIDENCES.  OF COURSE THEY FOUND NOTHING, AND FATHER ELLACURIA
INVITED THEM TO RETURN ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE UCA CAMPUS, BUT
THEY DID NOT DO SO."

   ALSO, TOJEIRA CONFIRMED THAT ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE UCA IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL.

   "I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE PLACE LATER, BUT UP UNTIL
2200 ON WEDNESDAY, HOURS BEFORE THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE, THE SOLDIERS
WERE THERE," TOJEIRA ADDED.

   "THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THEREFORE, WE SHARE THE OPINION OF
ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA -- THAT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE ARE THE SAME
ONES WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO," HE ADDED.  


DEV-MUC3-0770 (U NEBRASKA)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 9 NOV 89 (PRENSA LIBRE) -- [TEXT] IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE
VIOLENCE DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, THE INFORMATION OFFICE OF THE
BUSINESS SECTOR (OFISEM) POINTS OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE OF SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE SO THAT THE ECONOMY CAN
MOVE IN A MANNER FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE STATISTICS ON THE SEPTEMBER VIOLENCE -- TAKEN FROM THE MEDIA --
SHOW THERE IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN SOME ASPECTS, BUT THE PREVAILING
SITUATION IS OF GREAT CONCERN, THE BUSINESSMEN ADD.

   IN A COMPARISON OF THE STATISTICS FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, IT IS
NOTED THAT 142 MURDERS WERE REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER WHILE 126 WERE
REPORTED IN AUGUST.  OFISEM ALSO REPORTS THAT 17 KIDNAP CASES WERE
REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER, AGAINST 19 CASES IN AUGUST.  AS FOR MISSING
PERSONS, THERE WERE 12 REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER AND 19 IN AUGUST.

   THE REPORT ADDS THERE WERE 26 CASES OF ASSAULT IN SEPTEMBER,
AGAINST 71 CASES IN AUGUST, WHILE THERE WERE 41 CRIMINAL ATTACKS IN
SEPTEMBER AND 57 IN AUGUST.  CONCERNING ACTIONS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS,
OFISEM ADDS ONE SUCH ACTION WAS REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND 12 IN
AUGUST.  FIVE CASES OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING WERE REPORTED IN AUGUST,
AND ONLY ONE IN SEPTEMBER.

   OFICEM ONCE AGAIN URGES THE AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THEIR
ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE GUATEMALANS, WHO DESERVE TO
LIVE IN PEACE IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS CONDUCIVE FOR THE PROGRESS OF
GUATEMALA.  


DEV-MUC3-0771 (U NEBRASKA)

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT] [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AFTER 5 DAYS OF COMBAT, CONFRONTING THIS ARMED
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TERRORISTS, [WORDS INDISTINCT] I WANT TO INFORM YOU OF THE SITUATION
THROUGHOUT THE NATION:

   IN THE WESTERN AREA, THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS.  IN THE EASTERN AREA,
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.  IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMAND HAS BEEN OPERATING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, AND IT HAS
AVOIDED HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE
TERRORISTS IN THE [NAMES INDISTINCT] NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALSO IN USULUTAN
LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING, [WORDS INDISTINCT] BUT AT PRESENT
ONLY SOME EXPLOSIONS AND SOME SPORADIC FIRING ARE HEARD IN THE
VICINITY OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  IN ZACATECOLUCA YESTERDAY WE
MANAGED TO CONTROL THE POPULATION COMPLETELY.  WE DISLODGED THE
TERRORISTS FROM THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THE FMLN HAS
WAGED ITS GREATEST EFFORTS HERE. THEY ARE [WORD INDISTINCT]
TERRORISTS, AND THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH.  IN SOME
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA, THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] MEJICANOS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] AS OF SUNDAY, 12 NOVEMBER. IN SOME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] OF THE CAPITAL CITY.  IN MEJICANOS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] NORTH OF THE GUADALUPE AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] REPARTO SANTA MARTA, AND ALTOS DEL [WORD
INDISTINCT]. IN THIS AREA, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTIONS
TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO NEUTRALIZE THIS GENOCIDE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE SOME PARTIAL
RESULTS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SUSTAINED THE FOLLOWING: 177 DEAD AND
251 WOUNDED.

   AMONG THE TERRORISTS THERE ARE 655 DEAD AND 491 WOUNDED.  WE HAVE
CAPTURED 92 FMLN MEMBERS, AND 6 FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES
IN.  AS FOR THE CIVILIANS, WE REGRET 47 PERSONS HAVE DIED, AND 153
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SEIZED FROM THE FMLN TERRORISTS 324 RIFLES,
75 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 15
SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND 40 WEAPONS OF OTHER TYPES.  FOUR ARSENALS HAVE
ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN MEJICANOS, WHERE THE TERRORISTS HAD A
CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES
AND IN YOUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING JOINTLY. OUR COMMANDER
IN CHIEF IS UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND
WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THE ARMED FORCES IS WORKING IN A VERY
PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE THIS
SITUATION BY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT
TAKES LONGER FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO DO THINGS.

   ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE WANT TO THANK YOU, OUR PEOPLE,
FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH PLENTY OF
INFORMATION, SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS IN THE VARIOUS COMBAT AREAS, AND--
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--CONDEMNING AND REJECTING THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK. THAT IS THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF THE FMLN.

   WE ARE ALL WORKING, STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, TO
MAINTAIN FREEDOM [WORD INDISTINCT], AND ACHIEVE PEACE. I ALSO WANT TO
INFORM YOU THAT AFTER VISITING THIS AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS AREAS WHERE
WE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT], THE MORALE OF OUR TROOPS AND OFFICERS IS
VERY HIGH. AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING
TO DEFEND YOU.

   [WORD INDISTINCT] THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE A VERY LOW MORALE,
[WORDS INDISTINCT] MANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW AWARE OF THEIR
CASUALTIES AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   I WANT TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE
ARMED FORCES, TO STRONGLY CONDEMN THOSE WHO THIS MORNING MASSACRED SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS. WE REGRET AS WELL THE DEATHS OF OTHER CIVILIANS,
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONFLICT. WE ALSO
REGRET THE DEATHS AMONG OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE,
AND THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND ARE PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONAL
WORK BEING DONE AT THE VARIOUS GARRISONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE ASK FOR YOUR
SUPPORT. YOU MUST CONTINUE GOING TO WORK AND CONTINUE WORKING.  IN
CONCLUSION, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR MORAL AND
MATERIAL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AT SUCH A
DIFFICULT TIME.  


DEV-MUC3-0772 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [REPORT] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] SIX DAYS AFTER HAVING
INITIATED OUR OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY,
THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING TREND TOWARD THE CONSOLIDATION AND
BROADENING OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
POSITIONS IN IMPORTANT CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH HAVE
PLAYED LEADING ROLES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE
STRUGGLE.

   TODAY WE COMPLETED AN ARCH OF FREEDOM IN SAN SALVADOR BY EXTENDING
AND CONNECTING SEVERAL AREAS UNDER OUR CONTROL, AFTER REPELLING AND
SWAMPING THE GOVERNMENT'S SPECIAL BATTALIONS IN FIVE COUNTERATTACKS
SUPPORTED BY ARMORED VEHICLES AND AERIAL BOMBINGS.

   OUR FIGHTERS DISPLAYED SINGULAR HEROISM DURING THE OCCUPATION OF
THE CUSCATANCINGO HEADQUARTERS AND THE COMMANDS IN MEJICANOS AND
CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE WE CAPTURED A LARGE ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND
AMMUNITION, AND DURING CLASHES IN [NAME INDISTINCT], SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD
MERLIOT, AND [NAME INDISTINCT].

   THE FMLN ALSO HAS FORCES ALONG THE LEADING ROUTES TO THE CAPITAL CITY;
THESE FORCES HARASS AND HINDER ARMY DEPLOYMENTS ON THE PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY,
AND ON THE SAN SALVADOR-SANTA TECLA HIGHWAY.

   WE NOW HIGHLIGHT OUR FORCES' FEATS: COMPANIES FORMED BY POPULAR
FORCES HAVE EXTENDED THEIR CONTROL OVER NEW AREAS AND CITIES IN SAN
MIGUEL AND USULUTAN, WHERE WEAPONS HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND PRISONERS OF
WAR TAKEN.  WE STRESS OUR PERMANENT HARASSMENT OF ENEMY FORCES IN
ZACATECOLUCA, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, APOPA, SAN MARTIN, SAN MARCOS,
NUEVA CONCEPCION, SANTA ELENA, AND OTHER TOWNS.

   TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN PARALYZED SINCE THE FMLN DECLARED A
STOPPAGE, AND MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO
SABOTAGE.  THE CRITICAL DEADLINE THE HIGH COMMAND SET FOR ITSELF TO
RECOVER OUR POSITIONS HAS PASSED, AND OUR FORCES HAVE ASSAULTED
HEADQUARTERS IN CONTROLLED AREAS AND HAVE REQUISITIONED WEAPONS AND
AMMUNITION.

   HUNDREDS OF YOUTHS CONTINUE TO JOIN OUR ARMY.  WITHOUT POPULAR
SUPPORT THE FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED POLITICAL-MILITARY VICTORIES
OF SUCH DIMENSIONS AS TO TAKE THE ENEMY BY SURPRISE AND EARN THE
WORLD'S ADMIRATION.

   IN THE PAST 2 DAYS THE FMLN HAS INFLICTED DOZENS OF CASUALTIES
AMONG THE ARMY'S OFFICERS AND TROOPS, AND IT HAS TAKEN FIVE PRISONERS
OF WAR, AMONG WHOM ARE A CAPTAIN AND A LIEUTENANT, WHOSE PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL WELL BEING HAS BEEN RESPECTED.  THE FMLN HAS SEIZED 63 RIFLES,
4 MACHINEGUNS, 3 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, 5 PRC-77 RADIOS, [WORDS
INDISTINCT], AND THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FROM THE OCCUPIED
HEADQUARTERS AND COMMANDS.

   WE CALL ON ALL THE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE UPRISING [WORD INDISTINCT]
AGAINST THE FASCIST GENOCIDE.  WE ASK THE OFFICERS AND TROOPS NOT TO
CONTINUE SERVING IN AN ARMY THAT IS BEHAVING LIKE A FOREIGN OCCUPATION
ARMY, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, EXECUTING PRIESTS,
AND MASSACRING LABOR LEADERS.

   IN THE CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDE, A SEA OF GUERRILLAS [BREAK IN
RECEPTION PREVENTS COMPLETION OF ITEM].


DEV-MUC3-0773 (U NEBRASKA)

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH SAN SALVADOR AND WE ARE RECEIVING MORE REPORTS ON THE PERSECUTION
UNLEASHED AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WE REMIND YOU THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES
AND COLONEL INOCENTE ORLANDO MONTANO LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE
LUTHERAN AND OTHER CHURCHES THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR.  NOW THIS
CAMPAIGN, ORCHESTRATED BY COL ELENA FUENTES, CHIEF OF THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE'S DEATH SQUADS, HAS HEIGHTENED.  NOT ONLY HAVE JESUIT PRIESTS
BEEN MURDERED, BUT THIS MORNING THE NATIONAL GUARD ARRESTED TWO
PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.  CITIZEN.  WE
REPEAT: TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  THESE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD.  WE CALL ON ALL THE [WORD INDISTINCT] AROUND THE WORLD; WE CALL
ON ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SECTORS TO MOBILIZE.  TWO PRIESTS
AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD IN SAN SALVADOR.  AMONG THE ARRESTED PERSONS IS A U.S.  CITIZEN.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS IS IN CONTACT WITH SAN SALVADOR TO GATHER MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO PRIESTS AND
SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN, WHO WERE ARRESTED.

   THE PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH CONTINUES BY ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] AND THE LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966
GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY]
MILITARY CLIQUE.  RADIO VENCEREMOS CALLS ON ALL THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD, THE
LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TO MOBILIZE, OCCUPY SALVADORAN EMBASSIES,
DEMONSTRATE IN FRONT OF SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORLD AND
DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE PRIESTS WHO WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY
THE NATIONAL GUARD.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] 1 MINUTE FOR THE RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD TO SPEAK OUT AND MOBILIZE TO PRESSURE
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. THIS COULD SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PERSONS ARRESTED
THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD, A BLOODTHIRSTY GUARD THAT IS
RELIVING THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOMOZIST GUARD.  THE KILLING OF PRIESTS
AND NOW THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES FURTHER
CONFIRMS THAT THE REGIME IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSING, THAT IT IS
DESPERATE AND NO LONGER CARES ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
PRESSURE, OR REQUESTS FOR AN END TO THE BOMBINGS AND BLOODSHED.  THIS
MORNING'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL
MISSIONARIES.


DEV-MUC3-0774 (U NEBRASKA)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [STATEMENT] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACTIONS SUCH AS
THESE, ACCOMPANIED BY ORCHESTRATED SLANDEROUS CAMPAIGNS, SCARE AWAY
INVESTMENTS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND THE HUMANITARIAN AID THAT WE NEED SO
MUCH.  DR CUSTODIO, THE SAME AS NORIEGA, CONTINUES TO DECEIVE THE
PEOPLE AND EXPLOIT THEM TO FURTHER PERSONAL INTERESTS AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.  AS A BUREAUCRAT, (ALTHOUGH HE TRIES TO COVER
THIS UP), CUSTODIO OWNS MANY MATERIAL GOODS AND FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS,
AND AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, HE IS FUELING THE BONFIRE OF VIOLENCE
IN OUR COUNTRY ONLY TO RUN AWAY WHEN THE FIRE GIVES WAY TO CHAOS AND
ANARCHY AMONG THE PEOPLE.  HE WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH HIS
INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS AND FEEL SATISFIED FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE.

PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA [SUBHEAD]

   CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING FOR PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  QUITE THE
CONTRARY, IT HAS DISCREDITED DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES AND SUPPORTED THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT OF DANIEL ORTEGA, WHO IS NOW DOING ALL HE CAN TO
BOYCOTT FREE ELECTIONS TO WHICH THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO,
AND TO MURDER THOSE WHO LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS AND ARE RETURNING TO THE
COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND LIBERTY.

   CODEH HAS DONE NOTHING TO PROMOTE PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS, BECAUSE IT IS SUPPORTING AND PROMOTING THE RECRUITMENT,
TRAINING, AND ACTIONS OF GUERRILLA GROUPS, WHICH ARE DESTABILIZING AND
SOWING VIOLENCE AMONG DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES.

   THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR.  CODEH BELIEVES THAT THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IS
THE BEST ONE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT], WITH CUBA'S SUPPORT, IS CHANNELLING ARMS TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF EL SALVADOR TO MURDER INNOCENT SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  ALL THIS IS TAKING PLACE WITH THE APPROVAL OF DR CUSTODIO AND HIS
FINANCING SOURCES, WHICH REALIZE THAT THEIR STRATEGIC, IDEOLOGICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL GOALS ARE COMING TRUE.  

CONCLUSION [SUBHEAD]

   IN CONCLUSION: WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT FROM DR CUSTODIO
AND CODEH WHEN THEY WOULD RATHER DESTROY HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE TO
INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMMUNISTS?

   WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS "LEADER" WHO IS CONSTANTLY
DENOUNCING CONDEMNATIONS AND ATTACKS AND DEFINES HIMSELF AS A
PERSECUTED PERSON, AND WHO MANIPULATES PUBLIC OPINION TO GAIN
NOTORIETY WHILE CREATING FEAR AND TERROR AMONG THE HONDURAN PEOPLE?

   WHAT FUTURE CAN HONDURAS EXPECT WHEN THE ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS
DEFENDER SPECIALIZES IN DISCREDITING THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ABROAD?

   WHAT CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE EXPECT WHEN CODEH COLLABORATES WITH
AND SUPPORTS THE ARMING OF THE SANDINISTS, SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS, AND
DICTATOR NORIEGA?

   DR CUSTODIO IS NOT BEING PERSECUTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS, HE IS NO
HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER, AND HE HAS NOT BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH.  HE IS
SIMPLY A MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN THE WRONG PATH.  WHILE COMMUNISM BEHIND
THE IRON CURTAIN, WHICH IS OVER 70 YEARS OLD, IS EMBRACING DEMOCRACY
AS A WAY OF LIFE (HUNGARY, POLAND), HE INTENDS TO REPLACE DEMOCRACY
FOR COMMUNISM AND LIBERTY FOR SLAVERY IN HONDURAS.

   DR CUSTODIO HAS SIMPLY MADE A MISTAKE AND HE STAYS ON HIS PATH
THROUGH DECEIT AND LIES.

   DOWN WITH THE HONDURAN MARXIST-LENINIST TRAITORS!

   STOP INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM!

   STOP THE MANIPULATION OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE!

   DEMOCRATS WILL NOT ALLOW THE ENSLAVEMENT AND MURDER OF THE PEOPLES!

   LET US STOP THOSE WHO MANIPULATE HUMAN RIGHTS OF OUR HONDURAS.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE RECENTLY HEARD
U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ON A SALVADORAN TELEVISION NEWSCAST.  HE SAID
NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HAD PLANNED THE MURDER OF FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA
AND THE OTHER JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS TELLS WILLIAM WALKER THAT HIS CYNICISM IS BEYOND
THE LIMIT.  WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHICH GENERAL STAFF
OFFICE ISSUED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER RADIO
CUSCATLAN URGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSASSINATE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RUBEN
ZAMORA, AND DOCTOR GUILLERMO UNGO.  THE WHOLE WORLD.... [CORRECTS
HIMSELF] THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAS FEATURED THE RECORDING IN WHICH
RADIO CUSCATLAN -- THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF'S RADIO, MEANING THE
RADIO CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, THE RADIO IN WHICH
NOT A SINGLE WORD, NOT A SINGLE COMMA GOES OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF
THE CENSORS WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON RADIO CUSCATLAN - - [WORDS
INDISTINCT] DEATH.

   THEREFORE, WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THE ORDER CAME
FROM; HE KNOWS THE EXACT TIME THAT 40 UNIFORMED MEN LEFT IN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] CURFEW, A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S
OFFICE.  WILLIAM WALKER'S CYNICISM WENT BEYOND THE LIMIT WHEN HE SAID
THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW [WORDS INDISTINCT] OR WHO PLANNED IGNACIO
ELLACURIA'S ASSASSINATION.

   WILLIAM WALKER IS DOING A HISTORICAL IMITATION OF THE FILIBUSTER
WHO CAME TO CENTRAL AMERICA IN 1856 TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME
PRESIDENT OF A CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION, MEANING NICARAGUA, WHO DECREED
THAT ENGLISH BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND THAT THE U.S.  FLAG BECOME
THE OCCUPATION FORCES' FLAG.  WILIAM WALKER IS RE- EDITING A SHAMEFUL
CHAPTER IN CENTRAL AMERICA'S HISTORY.  WILLIAM WALKER, THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN OUR HOMELAND, IS RE-EDITING -- IN THE FORM OF A
CARICATURE -- A HISTORICAL EVENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
HOWEVER, WE WANT TO TELL SOMETHING TO THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO HAS
BEEN FEATURED IN PRESS AND TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS GIVING FIGURES
WHICH DIFFER EVEN FROM THOSE GIVEN BY COL PONCE; THE NEW WILLIAM
WALKER, WHO THINKS HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND IS BETTER THAN
CRISTIANI AND COL PONCE, SO HE GIVES INVENTED FIGURES ON GUERRILLA
CASUALTIES; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO EVALUATES THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION, EVEN BEFORE CRISTIANI AND PONCE DO
SO, EVEN CONTRADICTING COL PONCE'S FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER SAID 40
MEMBERS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WERE
CAPTURED, YET THE BLEARY-EYED COL PONCE LAST NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 9 FMLN
MEMBERS.  WHERE, THEN, ARE THE REST OF THE CAPTURED FMLN FIGHTERS?

   HUMANITARIAN GROUPS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  RED
CROSS INTERNATIONAL, GREEN CROSS, AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL MUST
DEMAND THAT WILLIAM WALKER SAY WHERE THE CAPTURED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
ARE, BECAUSE COL PONCE ONLY MENTIONS NINE FIGHTERS.  COL PONCE TALKS
ABOUT NINE AND THE OTHER ONE TALKS ABOUT DOZENS.  THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  WHERE ARE
THE OTHER CAPTURED FIGHTERS?  MOST OF THEM WERE SURELY CIVILIANS WHO
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT.  THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN
THE WAR ZONES AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AS DEAD GUERRILLA
FIGHTERS.

   WE DEMAND, BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THAT AMBASSADOR
WILLIAM WALKER CLEARLY SAY HOW COL PONCE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN
ADMITTING THAT ONLY NINE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WERE CAPTURED -- WHILE THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR PERSONALLY REVEALED THE FIGURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
REVEALED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI A LONG TIME AGO -- EVEN IF THEY WERE
IMAGINARY FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION: WHERE
ARE THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS?

   TOKYO (JAPAN), 16 NOV 89 (KYODO) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS WILL PAY AN OFFICIAL WORKING VISIT TO JAPAN FROM DECEMBER 5-8,
A FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAID THURSDAY.

   BARCO WILL BE THE FIRST COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT JAPAN.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES ARE FORMULATING AN ECONOMIC AID PROGRAM FOR
COLOMBIA, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIGHTING AGAINST DRUG SYNDICATES,
INFORMED SOURCES SAID.

   JAPAN EXTENDED A TOTAL OF 6.69 MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC AID TO
COLOMBIA LAST YEAR.

   THE COLOMBIAN LEADER IS SCHEDULED TO MEET EMPEROR AKIHITO, PRIME
MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU AND FOREIGN MINISTER TARO NAKAYAMA.

   THE SOURCES ALSO SAID JAPANESE POLICE WILL PROVIDE TIGHT SECURITY
FOR BARCO AGAINST POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK DURING HIS FOUR-DAY STAY
HERE.

   BARCO HAS BEEN WAGING AN ALL-OUT WAR WITH THE DRUG CARTELS SINCE HE
TOOK OFFICE AS PRESIDENT IN 1986.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 17 NOV 89 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[ORLANDO CONTRERAS] [TEXT] FIGHTING CONTINUES TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR,
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TRIUMPHALIST TONE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY
BEGINS TO CHANGE.  AN AP CABLE WE RECEIVED THIS MORNING IN OUR
NEWSROOM SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY
HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS SUBURBS OF THIS CAPITAL.  THIS IS
WHAT THE AP CABLE SAYS TEXTUALLY IN ITS HEADLINE.

   IN ADDITION TO THIS SITUATION, THERE IS ANOTHER FACT IN THE
BATTLEFIELD TO WHICH THE NEWS AGENCIES HAVE NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION,
WHICH IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE TYPE OF COMBAT THAT THE SALVADORAN
FORCES ARE FIGHTING.  AP ITSELF SAYS THE FOLLOWING: THE WAR BECAME
DIRTY WITH THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN BY
UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS WHO ACTED DURING THE CURFEW.  FURTHERMORE, THE
CABLE SAYS THAT THE CANADIAN EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR REPORTED THAT 12
WORKERS FROM THE LUTHERAN CHURCH WERE ARRESTED BY UNIFORMED SECURITY
INDIVIDUALS IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.  AT THE BEGINNING, THE CABLE
SAID THAT THE SIX PRIESTS HAD BEEN MURDERED BY UNIDENTIFIED
TERRORISTS.  LATER, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS.

   AMONG THE PRIESTS MURDERED WAS FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF A MAGAZINE WHICH
REFLECTED THE PEOPLES' THOUGHTS, NOT ONLY IN EL SALVADOR BUT ALSO IN
THE REST OF CENTRAL AMERICA.  NONE OF THESE PRIESTS BELONGED TO THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  FURTHERMORE,
ELLACURIA HIMSELF ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED OPINIONS WHICH DID
NOT CONCUR WITH THOSE OF THE FMLN.  HOWEVER, HE FELT THAT A SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN PROBLEM COULD NOT EXCLUDE THE PEOPLE'S INCLUSION OF
THE FMLN.  THE ASSASSINS WHO ACTED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CURFEW
ARE FROM THE SALVADORAN ARMY, THEY ARE NOT UNIDENTIFIED TERRORISTS,
LIKE THE AP CABLE SAYS.  THEY ARE ASSASSINS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY,
THE SAME ARMY WHICH HAS ALL THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  IN
THIS, WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ON THE ONE HAND, ALL ITS PUBLICITY APPARATUS SAYS TO THE WORLD THAT
WASHINGTON IS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IT SUPPORTS THE ASSASSINS OF PRIESTS AND
SUPPLIES BOMBS AND ROCKETS SO THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS
PLANES AND HELICOPTERS PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES -- CAN BOMB THE
SALVADORAN CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THIS IS THE TRUTH THAT YANKEE PROPAGANDA IS
HIDING AND MANIPULATING.

WITH A STUPID LOOK ON HIS FACE, U.S.  AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ASKED WHO
HAD KILLED FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD DONE
THIS.  WELL THEN, MR WILLIAM WALKER, AND MONITORS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY, GOOD
MORNING; RADIO VENCEREMOS GREETS YOU.  WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE DOWN WHAT
WE ARE GOING TO SAY AND TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY TO WILLIAM WALKER'S OFFICE.

   GOOD MORNING U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS, TELL WILLIAM WALTER -- WE DO
NOT KNOW IF HE IS FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- THAT
RADIO VENCEREMOS IS GIVING HIM A CLUE SO THAT HE CAN FIND OUT WHO
KILLED FATHER ELLACURIA.  TELL WILLIAM WALKLER TO FIND OUT WHO
ARRESTED TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.
CITIZEN THIS MORNING.

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, THIS MORNING YOU ASKED WHO HAD MURDERED
FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA; RADIO VENCEREMOS WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE.  FIND
OUT WHO ORDERED THIS MORNING'S ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS.  U.S.
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU HAVE A DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU,
SPEAK UP, SAY WHAT YOU KNOW.  TELL US WHERE THE 40 MEN IN UNIFORM LEFT
FROM.  U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER FROM TENNESSEE, THAT IS, IF YOU
ARE FROM TENNESSEE LIKE THE OTHER FILIBUSTER -- RADIO VENCEREMOS IS
GIVING YOU A CLUE SO THAT YOU WILL FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU
CANDIDLY ASKED ON TELEVISION THIS MORNING.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DID NOT
KNOW WHO HAD ORDERED THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN IN
EL SALVADOR, NOT BORN IN EL SALVADOR BUT MORE SALVADORAN THAN COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE.

   WE REPEAT, MR AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR, THE FOLLOWING IS OUR CLUE:
FIND OUT WHO ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE PRIESTS AND MISSIONARIES,
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  FIND OUT IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU BETTER MOVE
QUICKLY, OTHERWISE THEY COULD BE KILLED.  THERE LIES YOUR ANSWER.  ASK
WHETHER THE TWO PRIESTS WERE ARRESTED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OR THE ARMED FORCES.  WE INSIST, IF
THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE ELENA FUENTES
STATEMENTS AGAINST THE CHURCH MONITORED A FEW DAYS AGO.

   MR AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF THERE IS A SINGLE DROP OF DECENCY
LEFT IN YOU, CHECK THE RECORDINGS THE U.S. EMBASSY HAS OF RADIO
CUSCATLAN AND LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS, AND MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ ON THE NIGHT OF 11
NOVEMBER AND EARLIER.

   GENTLEMEN AT THE U.S. EMBASSY WHO ARE MONITORING US, HELP THE
AMBASSADOR.  GO TO YOUR FILES, FIND THE RADIO CUSCATLAN RECORDINGS AND
TAKE THEM TO THE AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, HELP
THAT ABSENTMINDED AMBASSADOR.  MONITORS AT THE EMBASSY, GIVE HIM A
HAND; IT SEEM THAT THE AMBASSADOR'S MEMORY IS FAILING HIM.  MONITORS,
YOU WHO ARE SO EFFICIENT, WE ASK YOU TO HELP THE AMBASSADOR REGAIN HIS
MEMORY.  TAKE HIM COL ELENA FUENTE'S RECORDING ACCUSING THE CHURCH OF
HAVING TIES WITH THE FMLN.  TAKE HIM COL MONTANO'S STATEMENTS, TAKE
HIM COL ZEPEDA'S STATEMENTS, TAKE HIM ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON'S
STATEMENTS, ACCUSING FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA OF BEING THE DIRECTOR OF
THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.  HELP US U.S. EMBASSY MONITORS BECAUSE IT
SEEMS THAT MR WILLIAM WALKER HAS A VERY SHORT MEMORY.

RECEIVED IN THIS NATIONAL RADIO-TELEVISION NETWORK, BRITISH NEWSMAN DAVID
BLUNDY OF THE SUNDAY TIMES [AS HEARD] BECAME A VICTIM OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, BULLETS.  HE DIED A FEW MINUTES AGO AT
ROSALES HOSPITAL. THE FMLN TERRORISTS DO NOT SATISFY THEIR INSTINCTS BY
KILLING CIVILIANS AND THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS, NOW
THEY ARE AIMING THEIR CRIMINAL MACHINEGUNS AT JOURNALISTS.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE, TOGETHER WITH THE
GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES, REPEAT THEIR CALL TO THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO REPUDIATE THE FMLN ASSASSINS.

   THE CIVILIANS WHO GAVE BLUNDY FIRST AID HAVE TOLD US THAT THE
NEWSMAN WAS HIT BY AN FMLN SNIPER WHEN HE WAS GREETING AN OFFICER OF
OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES IN MEJICANOS.

   THIS ACTION ONCE MORE CONFIRMS THE TREACHEROUS AND FLAGRANT HUMAN

THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] COMRADE VILLALOBOS [MEMBER OF THE GENERAL COMMAND OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] REFERRED TO THE
BOMBINGS AND THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  THIS IS THE QUESTION
HE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE
BOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND.  HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?  WHAT
INTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE
JESUITS?  COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VILLALOBOS] FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH
BLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE
AND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE
NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM.

   HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE [WORD
INDISTINCT] SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING.  THIS
IS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED
ON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY
UNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE
CRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE
GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --
BUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL
NETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL
MISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART
OF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.

   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO
STOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN [1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] A VERY CRITICAL
SITUATION.

   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE
WRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A
STRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE
FACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION
THAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A
SERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON
OUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.

   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY
HAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I
RATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR
POSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE
NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.

   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE
THE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON
THE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED
FORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG
COUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME
UP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN.
THEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE
NEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS.  THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE
THESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A
COUNTEROFFENSIVE.

   BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS.  THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
SITUATION.  THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A
GREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THEY HAD
AN OVERALL PLAN.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH VILLALOBOS, MEMBER OF THE
GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [VILLALOBOS]
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ARMY CARRIED OUT A LARGE BOMB ATTACK ON
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EFFORT TO WEAKEN OUR POSITIONS.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THERE.  BUT
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, ASIDE FROM ALL THE PROPAGANDA THEY USED AND
THE PLAN TO WEAKEN US MILITARILY, THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED UNION
OFFICES AND THE HOMES OF LEADERS OF POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS
SECTORS.  APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY
FOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER.  THEY ALSO
FOUND THE JESUITS.  IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF RECENT TALKS WITH
CRISTIANI, FATHER ELLACURIA HAD BECOME VERY TRUSTING.  HE THOUGHT THAT
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.  [30-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] THIS
SITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER
OF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS
BEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED.  WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTION?
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TO OBTAIN A MILITARY VICTORY AND SET OUT TO
CARRY OUT A WITCH HUNT.  THEY SET OUT TO KILL ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS
THAT ONE NIGHT, WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE
FMLN, MILITARILY.  BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THEY DECIDED TO CARRY OUT
THIS ACTION TO GUARANTEE FOR THEMSELVES A FEW MORE YEARS OF STABILITY
THROUGH THE PEACE OF CEMETERIES, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

   WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?  THE DAY AFTER THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY
LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN.  THEY THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE THEIR DECISIVE DAY, BUT THE OFFENSIVE FAILED.  THEIR
ATTACK WAS REPELLED, THEY SUSTAINED MANY CASUALTIES, AND LOSS MUCH
MATERIEL.  THEIR TROOPS WERE FURTHER BEATEN AND THEY DID NOT OBTAIN
ANY EFFECTIVE MILITARY RESULTS.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR COUNTEROFFENSIVE WAS REJECTED AND THE BLOW THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT
FAILED, ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LEADERS WERE HIDING AND
ON THE OTHER BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED AN HORRENDOUS CRIME AND IT
BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A CRIME [WORD INDISTINCT] BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND
MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT.  CRISTIANI CLEARLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND
PROBABLY EVEN THE U.S. EMBASSY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THEY
THOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO
ACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  THIS IS VERY CLEAR.  BUT THIS
ACTION BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT
THAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS GOING TO RESULT
IN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS
STRONGER.  AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.

   THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME.  I REALLY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.  IN ADDITION,
THEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND
ASSASSINS.  THEY MUST LEAVE POWER.  THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN
WHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT.  THEY HAVE CREATED
A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
OLIGARCHIC SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY WILL BE CAUSED BY THEIR
OWN MISTAKES.  [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (INTERPRESS AGENCY [IPS]) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS
TODAY PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A SALVATION JUNTA THAT WOULD INCLUDE
THE ARMY AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT],
HUMBERTO CENTENO -- LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS [UNTS] -- HAS ANNOUNCED.  IN STATEMENTS TO IPS,
CENTENO SAID THE FMLN HAS ALREADY SAID IT IS WILLING TO JOIN THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, AND THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A PART OF A
SALVATION JUNTA AS A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS.

   THE UNTS' PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED BY FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] NATIONAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION, IN STATEMENTS TO THE
PRESS.  CHAVEZ MENA, WHO WAS THE PDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE
PAST ELECTIONS, SAID THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL WAR
PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RECTIFY ITS STAND AND INITIATE
NEW NEGOTIATIONS.  WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE TOLD
NEWSMEN, ADDING THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL ACHIEVE A MILITARY VICTORY.

   MEANWHILE, CENTENO STATED THAT THE BOMBINGS IN DENSELY POPULATED
AREAS AND THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FACTORS THAT ARE
WEARING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.
ACCORDING TO THE LABOR LEADER, NONE OF THE SOCIAL FORCES WITH ANY
REPRESENTATIVE FORCE SUPPORT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS GOVERNMENT.

   ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CONSENSUS, THE POLITICAL AND LABOR
GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND THE
RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE OAS AND THE UNITED
NATIONS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AS GUARANTORS OF
THE AGREEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE PETITION MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL BY A
GOVERNMENT THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE

[GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] WE
CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY [URNG] GENERAL COMMAND
EXPRESSES ITS PROFOUND SOLIDARITY AND ADMIRATION FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD FORCES, THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT], WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION,
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES IN SALVADORAN HISTORY.

   WITH DEEP INDIGNATION, WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA,
[MEMBERS OF THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT AND MAINTAIN MASSIVE
BOMBINGS AGAINST THE DEFENSELESS CIVILIAN POPULATION, THUS SOWING DEATH,
SLAUGHTERING, AND DESTROYING, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT,
DISLODGE, OR CONTAIN THE HEROIC FMLN FIGHTERS.

   CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAVE LOST CONTROL
OVER THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DESPERATION OVER THE FMLN'S
VICTORIOUS ADVANCE.  THE FMLN FORCES HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR
POSITIONS, BUT HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEM IN SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT
THE REMAINING SALVADORAN TERRITORY.

   ACTING OUT OF REVENGE, CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN
ARMY BEGAN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FAIR CAUSES OF THE SALVADORAN MAJORITY.
AS A RESULT, EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.

   WE SHARE THE ENORMOUS PAIN OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT OF THE
JESUIT COMMUNITIES.  WE ADD OUR PROTEST TO THE VOICES OF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH A VILE MURDER.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNS THOSE ACTIONS AND
CALLS ON THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND ON ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL,
DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST
THOSE BARBARIC AND GENOCIDAL ACTIONS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE COMPARED TO
THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS
DURING WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR STATEMENT ISSUED ON 13 NOVEMBER, WE REPORTED THE
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST OUR FRATERNAL
NATION, EL SALVADOR.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS RELEASED BY PRESS AGENCIES
ON 15 NOVEMBER, 126 GUATEMALAN ARMY MEN BELONGING TO SPECIAL TROOPS
CALLED SAIBILES, WHO CHARACTERIZED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR PATHOLOGIC
SAVAGERY, WERE DEPLOYED.  [SENTENCE AS HEARD] PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE
CHIEF OF THE GUATEMALAN GENERAL STAFF, AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN HAVE ALREADY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY
AND SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI.

   WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERFERENCE OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY
AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE CALL ON ALL GUATEMALAN
GROUPS TO PROTEST THAT INTERFERENCE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMY PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THIS AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE WARN THE WORLD THAT A GENOCIDE LARGER THAN THE ONE WHICH HAS
ALREADY OCCURRED IS BEING CONDUCTED IN EL SALVADOR NOW.  WE ARE SURE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES; THAT THEY WILL BE
THE WINNERS OF THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE
THEIR GOALS.

   THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL TURN INTO NEW LIFE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS OF FREEDOM,
DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE
HAVE POWERFUL REASONS FOR ENSURING THAT JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED IN THIS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN WHICH FATHER ELLACURIA, OTHER PRIESTS, AND
CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.  WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRAW
PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING SO; WE URGE YOU TO HEED
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUS AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SAN SALVADOR'S CALLS
THAT THIS CASE NOT BE POLITICIZED OR USED TO GENERATE FURTHER VIOLENCE
IN THE COUNTRY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED; WE ARE
COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION TO PUNISH THE
PERPETRATORS OF THIS SAVAGE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS INVOLVED.  THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL
REQUEST HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE SALVADORAN CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WILL BE ADVISED BY EXPERTS IN ORDER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF
THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE WILL ASK THE UNITED
STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND SPAIN TO HELP US.  I MENTION SPAIN BECAUSE
SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ASSASSINATED ARE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO CONDUCT AN
INVESTIGATION AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED IN REPREHENSIBLE
ACTIONS LIKE THIS ONE INSTEAD OF POLITICIZING THEM AND GENERATING
FURTHER VIOLENCE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL NEVER
ALLOW A RETURN TO THE PAST; A RETURN TO THOSE DRAMATIC AND REGRETTABLE
TIMES IN THE COUNTRY WHEN GROUPS WANTED TO FUTHER THEIR CAUSE THROUGH
VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND
WILL PURSUE SUCH GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE
LAW.

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (CADENA REVOLUCIONARIA NACIONAL) -- [REPORT]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] ON
THE 7TH DAY OF THE OFFENSIVE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] HAS TAKEN A STRATEGIC TURN IN THE WAR, AS WE BEGIN TO
STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN A NEW AND DEFINITE SCENARIO OF OPERATIONS IN THE
CITIES, WITH THE INSURRECTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THE FIGHTING WAGED IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN
MIGUEL, USULUTAN, ZACATECOLUCA, SANTA ANA, AND OTHER PARTS IN THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE.

   THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST
DICTATORSHIP TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD.  THE DICTATORSHIP HAS REMOVED
ITS CIVILIAN MASK, AND IT HAS SHOWN ITS BARBARIC NATURE AS IT BOMBED
CITIES AND MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL
CONSCIENCE THAT IS SEEKING SOCIAL CHANGES AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF
THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] DEFINITELY ISOLATE
THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE
LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S.  CONGRESS DISCUSSES
CUTTING MILITARY AID TO THE REGIME.  THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE
LED TO IRREVERSIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE REGIME HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE
POLITICAL FIELD AND FATALY WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY FIELD.

   IN 7 DAYS OF COMBAT IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE HIGH COMMAND LOST ITS
LAST DEFENSIVE LINE.  OUR FORCES ARE HITTING HARD AT THEIR TIRED
HEART.  VICTORY IS A FACT THAT NO ONE CAN ALTER.

   IN THE OFFENSIVE, WE KILLED OR WOUNDED AN ESTIMATED 827 TROOPS AND
OFFICERS.  WE SEIZED 127 LONG WEAPONS, 21 MACHINEGUNS AND SUPPORT
WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 80,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS
CALIBERS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DAMAGED 11 AIRCRAFT
AND DESTROYED 27 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.

   THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT OF THE HIGH COMMAND IS EVIDENT IN A
DEPRESSED COL PONCE, WHO NO LONGER SPEAKS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN POCKETS
ALONG THE BORDER.  INSTEAD, HE SPEAKS IN FRONT OF A MAP OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, POINTING OUT THE PRESENCE AND ADVANCE OF THE FMLN.

   VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS OF EL SALVADOR HAVE INITIATED
EFFORTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN ORDER TO
FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR AND BRING ABOUT
THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FMLN LOOKS FAVORABLY ON THESE
EFFORTS, AND IT HAS ALREADY ACTIVELY JOINED THESE NATIONAL SECTORS WHO
ARE OPPOSED TO THE GENOCIDE BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND IN A
SUICIDAL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE WAR THAT IT HAS TURNED INTO A
BUSINESS DEAL.

   THE GENERAL COMMAND RECOGNIZES THE HEROISM OF OUR FIGHTERS AND
CALLS ON THEM TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ALONG WITH OUR REBELS IN THE FINAL
CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 17 NOV 89 (LA REPUBLICA) -- [TEXT] PRD [DEMOCRATIC
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY] COMMUNIQUE:

   TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LATIN AMERICAN CHURCH MET IN MEDELLIN AND
DECIDED TO WORK FOR THE NEEDY, DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR HAVE
MURDERED IGNACIO ELLACURIA, A PRIEST, TEACHER, AND A SOCIAL FIGHTER,
ALONG WITH SEVEN OTHER PRIESTS AND FAITHFUL.  A WAR THAT BEGAN WITH
THE MARTYRDOM OF ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO IS NOW TAKING THE
LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO ARE KILLED IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS
AND ATTACKS ON THE POPULATION.

   THE CRIME COMMITTED TODAY WAS SPONSORED BY THE SAME ONES WHO ARE
NOW PLANNING GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S MURDER.  THERE IS ONLY A
DIFFERENCE OF TIME AND PLACE.  INSTEAD OF BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOODS, THESE PEOPLE ARE RESORTING TO ATTACKS ON CERTAIN
FIGURES AND LEADERS.

   BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS, IT IS
EVIDENT THAT THE CHURCH CANNOT ESCAPE THE DEMAND THAT MODERN TIMES
IMPOSE ON ALL GROUPS OF DECIDING WHETHER TO BE ON THE SIDE OF
PATRIOTIC AND LIBERTARIAN CAUSES OR TO BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF LOCAL AND
FOREIGN OPPRESSORS.

   LIKE MSGR ROMERO, FATHER ELLACURIA AND HIS COMPANIONS IN MARTYRDOM
REPRESENT THE CHURCH THAT IS BORN FROM THE HOMELAND AND THAT STRUGGLES
ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE.  PANAMANIAN GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS ALSO DECIDED
TO WORK ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE ARMED FORCES.  THESE
MARTYRS DESERVE THE SAME SOLIDARITY THEY GAVE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN
CAUSE OF NATIONAL LIBERATION, BECAUSE THEY CHALLENGED THE OLIGARCHY,
IMPERIALISM, AND EVEN THE REACTIONARY GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHURCH.

   NOW, WHEN ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CRISIS AND FOREIGN
AGGRESSION FALLS UPON THE SALVADORAN AND PANAMANIAN PEOPLES; NOW THAT
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE MASSIVELY REPRESSED; AND NOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON ORDERS THE CIA TO ATTACK GEN NORIEGA, THOSE
WHO STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR AND THOSE WHO PATRIOTICALLY RESIST ARE IN
FACT DOING SO FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA.

   THUS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA'S AND HIS PARTNERS' SACRIFICE, AS WELL AS
THE PREVIOUS SACRIFICE OF MSGR ROMERO AND THAT OF GEN NORIEGA, WILL
BEAR FRUITS OF LIBERATION, JUSTICE, AND SOVEREIGNTY.

   THESE FRUITS WILL BE PLENTIFUL AND MORE DELICIOUS IF ALL THOSE WHO
HAVE BEEN NEXT TO AND LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE STRUGGLING
WITH THEIR EXAMPLE IN MIND.  THE SACRIFICE THEY HAVE MADE FOR ALL OF
US DESERVES PRAISE AND SOLIDARITY.  WE OFFER THEM THAT PRAISE AND
SOLIDARITY BY REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK AND STRUGGLE FOR THE
DEFINITIVE LIBERATION OF OUR OWN PEOPLE.

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY, UCN [UNION OF THE NATIONAL CENTER], AND THE MLN
[NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT], IN SUM, ALL THE POLITICAL FORCES
JOINED IN CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN, AND SUPPORTING OUR

SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS SUPPORT MUST SERVE TO MOTIVATE US TO CREATE
A UNITED FRONT, REJECT THE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE, AND SEEK THE
PEACE OUR COUNTRY WANTS AND NEEDS.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE ARE SURE THIS WILL BE OVER SOON.  IN TIMES
LIKE THESE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS REACTED IN A POSITIVE
MANNER.  SOLIDARITY EXISTS AMONG ALL SALVADORANS TO SEEK AND HELP THE
NEEDIEST.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS READY TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN
ITS POWER TO ACHIEVE TOTAL NORMALIZATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IN
ADDITION, IT IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE THE MILITARY CHIEFS AND OFFICERS
AND, ESPECIALLY, THE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFENDING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE FOR MANY DAYS, TRYING TO OUST THE FMLN HORDES FROM SAN SALVADOR
AND OTHER CITIES WHERE THEY SOUGHT TO SOW TERROR.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE MILITARY CHIEFS AND OFFICERS MUST FEEL THE
SUPPORT FROM ALL THE PEOPLE AND, PRIMARILY, OUR RECOGNITION OF THEIR
BRAVERY AND TOTAL DEDICATION TO THEIR FATHERLAND AND PEOPLE, WHO ARE
NOW SEEKING PEACE AND CALM.  AS FOR US, MILITARY CHIEFS, OFFICERS,
SOLDIERS: OUR HIGHEST RECOGNITION AND GRATITUDE.  HISTORY WILL REWARD
YOU AND SAY THE GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES AND THEIR UNITS FOUND THE ROAD

LEARNED WHAT IS HAPPENING.  WE WILL BE GIVING YOU THE INFORMATION YOU

NEIGHBORHOODS -- WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES BY THE TERRORIST
CRIMINALS -- THAT THEY MAY RETURN TO THEIR HOMES ON 18 NOVEMBER, BECAUSE THE
TERRORIST CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN DISLODGED FROM THEIR POSITIONS.

   THE BRIGADE COMMAND ALSO REPORTS THAT THE SITUATION IN USULUTAN IS
80-PERCENT NORMAL.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE WISH TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFORTS
MADE BY THE ATONAL, OROMONTIQUE, JUCUARAN, AND LENCA BATTALIONS AS
WELL AS THE SECURITY CORPS, WHO HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THESE

   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] ...HAVE CONTROLLED THE
TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT].  ON 17 NOVEMBER, THE ARMED FORCES MADE GREAT ADVANCES, AND WE
CAN NOW SAY THAT THE AREA OF ZACAMIL HAS BEEN TOTALLY RECOVERED.  THE
CIVILIAN RESIDENTS OF THAT SECTOR HAVE SUFFERED VERY MUCH.  LIKEWISE,
THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL OTHER AREAS IN MEJICANOS MUNICIPALITY.  THERE
ARE ONLY SOME SMALL POCKETS IN CIUDAD DELGADO AND SOME SECTORS OF
SOYAPANGO MUNICIPALITY WHERE THERE ARE STILL SOME CLASHES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE FMLN INSISTS ON
CONTINUING WITH THESE DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAKE INNOCENT PEOPLE,
WHO ONLY WANT TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND LIVE IN PEACE, GO THROUGH
SOME TRULY DRAMATIC MOMENTS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE
THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE GOING TO DEFINITELY CONTROL ALL OF THESE
FMLN TERRORISTS.  THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE ARMED FORCES ADVANCE,
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE TRUST THAT EACH DAY WE WILL CONTINUE ADVANCING UNTIL WE HAVE
FULL CONTROL, IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE, ALWAYS RESPECTING
THE LIVES OF THOSE CIVILIANS IN DANGER.  IN A COWARDLY MANNER, THE
FMLN HIDES BEHIND THESE INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND USES THEM AS SHIELDS.

   WE ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED IN ANY MANNER TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES THAT,
THROUGH THE EMERGENCY COMMISSION, THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING BASIC
SERVICES, AS BEST IT CAN, TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY
DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THE HELP OF ALL THE FRIENDLY COUNTRIES WHO ARE
ALREADY BEGINNING TO HELP AND SEND AID, [CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR EXAMPLE,
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT TOMORROW
THE KING OF SPAIN IS SENDING A PLANE LOADED WITH MEDICATION. ANOTHER
PLANE IS BRINGING 55,000 TONS OF MEDICATIONS FROM THE ORDER OF MALTA.
THE SALVADORAN-AMERICAN FOUNDATION IS SENDING A VERY GENEROUS DONATION
OF 200 FIELD TENTS TO BE USED TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR MANY FAMILIES
FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE WEATHER.  THERE IS ALSO THE ROTARY CLUB,
AND THERE IS EVEN A COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES CALLED COOPERATION
CALIFORNIA THAT IS SENDING 3,000 TONS OF CORN.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS YOU HAVE OBSERVED, AID IS ON ITS WAY.  WE
WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE IN SUCH SITUATIONS, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
TO REMAIN CALM, TO LISTEN TO THE INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE
CONTINUOUSLY BEING GIVEN OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK, AND TO
COOPERATE AND HELP SO THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD AND MEDICATIONS
CAN BE DONE IN THE BEST ORDERLY MANNER.  WE FEEL THAT WHAT THE COUNTRY
HAD IN STORAGE AND WHAT THESE GENEROUS COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE
DONATING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ATTEND TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING
MOMENTARILY AFFECTED.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS ALSO MAKING EFFORTS TO HAVE A
RECONSTRUCTION FUND.  WE KNOW THAT MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED.
THE TERRORISTS HAVE OPENED HUGE HOLES IN ORDER TO MOVE IN BETWEEN        
THESE HOUSES.  THIS COWARDLY ATTACK BY THE FMLN HAS BROUGHT ABOUT
MUCH DESTRUCTION.  ONCE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN NORMALIZED, WE WANT
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT YOU CAN REBUILD
YOUR HOMES AND RETURN TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

   THE FMLN DELEGATE URGED INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, INSTITUTIONS,

THAT U.S. PILOTS TOOK PART IN INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND

   "WE HAVE COME TO STATE THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST THAT THE

ARRIVED TODAY AT 1415 GMT.

   SIX JESUITS, FIVE OF THEM OF SPANISH BACKGROUND, WERE ASSASSINATED
ON 16 NOVEMBER BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   THE HIGH- RANKING SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL ALSO ANNOUNCED
HIS INTENTION OF "EVACUATING THOSE SPANIARDS WHO WISH TO LEAVE,"
APPROXIMATELY 20, ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN
SAN SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN
THE SITES OF FIERCE CLASHES AND BOMBINGS SINCE THE GUERRILLA GROUPS'

WITH NORMAN LACAYO, NICARAGUAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN EL SALVADOR BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [LACAYO, IN PROGRESS] ...GOVERNMENT AGAINST OUR
EMBASSY WORSENED.  THIS CAMPAIGN WAS INITIATED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS OVER THE PAST 8 DAYS,
TELEVISION, PRESS, AND RADIO HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY BROADCAST STATEMENTS BY EL
SALVADOR'S TOP MILITARY AND POLITICAL AUTHORITIES, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, VICE
PRESIDENT MERINO, AND THE HEAD OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE],
ETC, BLAMING NICARAGUA FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EL SALVADOR.

   THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIC AND IT HAS ENCOURAGED TERRORIST
GROUPS TO THREATEN THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF NICARAGUA'S DIPLOMATIC
REPRESENTATIVES.  OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, I HAVE RECEIVED MANY DEATH
THREATS FROM EXTREMIST SECTORS AND, I REPEAT, THIS LED THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT TO THE DECISION TO EVACUATE US.

   THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES ARE BROKEN.  IT IS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE TO ENSURE THE
ENTIRE MISSION'S PHYSICAL SAFETY.  WE REQUESTED DIPLOMATIC PROTECTION
FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND RECEIVED A POSITIVE RESPONSE.  WE WENT
TODAY FROM THE RESIDENCE OF THE MEXICAN AMBASSADOR IN EL SALVADOR TO
THE AIRPORT, AND FROM THERE TO MANAGUA.

   IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER THEM.

   [REPORTER] A QUESTION FROM RADIO SANDINO.  FIRST OF ALL, SINCE YOU
GOT A FIRST- HAND VIEW, WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR;
SECOND, IS THIS A PROVISIONAL MEASURE OR WILL IT BE EXTENDED; HOW LONG
WILL THIS MEASURE LAST?

   [LACAYO] I CANNOT SAY HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.  THAT IS UP TO THE
GOVERNMENT, AND IT WILL DEPEND ON THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN THE
COUNTRY.  REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION, THE SITUATION IS DIFFICULT.
ON A MILITARY LEVEL, THE WAR CONTINUES; THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF
MISINFORMATION BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY INTERNATIONAL
NEWS AGENCIES.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE BATTLE CONTINUES, THERE HAS BEEN
CONSIDERABLE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION IN MANY TOWNS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ON
THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR.  YOU KNOW WHICH TOWNS ARE INCLUDED:
ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, ETC. THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE.

   [REPORTER] THERE IS A REPORT THAT SOMOZIST GUARDS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  IS THERE ANYTHING TO THIS?

   [LACAYO] THERE ARE RUMORS TO THAT EFFECT.  SOME INSURGENT RADIO
STATIONS HAVE REPORTED IT, AND THEY HAVE ALSO MENTIONED TROOPS FROM
OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] YES, BUT NOT WITH THE PERSISTENCE THAT PREVAILS NOW.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] OF COURSE.  MANY TELEPHONE CALLS, SURVEILLACE BY
SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS AND VEHICLES AT THE RESIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, AND ESPECIALLY DIRECT THREATS BY TELEPHONE.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ARE SALVADORAN RIGHTWING EXTREMISTS,
BETTER KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS.  THEY BEGAN TO SELECTIVELY SHOOT PEOPLE.
THERE IS THE CASE OF MRS NORMA GIROLA DE HERRERA, PRESIDENT OF THE
WOMENS INSTITUTE, A VERY PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTION.  MRS HERERA WAS VERY
WELL KNOWN, AND SHE WAS MURDERED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES VERY SIMILAR TO
THOSE OF THE ASSASINATION OF THE JESUITS; ON THE SAME DAY.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO[ I DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S
MILITARIZATION.  A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED, THE
CIRCULATION OF VEHICLES IS MINIMAL, COMMUNICATION IS SPARSE,
TELEPHONES ARE TAPPED.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] YES, THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] THEY ARE WAGING A WAR WHICH CONSISTS AT TIMES OF
MAINTAINING POSITIONS, AT OTHER TIMES OF MOBILIZING.  ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS CONTROLLED AREAS CEASED TO BE CONTROLLED BUT THE WAR
CONTINUES.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] NO, I DO NOT KNOW.  THE GOVERNMENT DID THAT DIRECTLY
THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] NO, BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW.  HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT
WE NEVER HAD PROTECTION.  WE NEVER HAD POLICE PROTECTION AT THE
RESIDENCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS REQUESTED THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE
EMBASSY HAD TWO POLICEMEN, BUT DURING THIS PERIOD THEY LEFT AND THE
EMBASSY IS WITHOUT POLICE PROTECTION.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LACAYO] THAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

INVESTIGATION" AND "TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE" FOR THE MURDER OF SIX

   ARIAS, WHO ARRIVED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR ALONG WITH OTHER HIGH-RANKING
SPANISH OFFICIALS, SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT SEEMS WILLING TO PROMOTE A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE
MASSACRE."

   THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION CAME TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF THEM SPANISH, WERE MURDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS.

   INOCENCIO ARIAS AFFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS "A LUCID,
INTELLIGENT, AND WELL-INTENDED PERSON," WHO IS "APPARENTLY INTERESTED
IN CLARIFYING THE FACTS."

   AFTER MEETING WITH ARIAS, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT EXPLAINED TO
ACAN-EFE THAT HE REQUESTED EXPERTS BE SENT FROM SPAIN, THE UNITED
STATES, AND GREAT BRITAIN.

   CRISTIANI JUSTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN EXPERTS "FROM SPAIN,
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE SPANISH; FROM THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THEY
REQUESTED IT; AND FROM GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE FAME OF SCOTLAND
YARD.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "WAS AFFECTED BY THE DEATHS
OF THE PRIESTS."

   ARIAS SAID THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR, HE WILL ALSO TRY
TO "WORK ON THE DEPARTURE OF THOSE SPANISH WHO ARE IN GREATER DANGER
IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE OFFICIAL DECLINED BLAMING ANY GROUP FOR THE DEATH OF THE
JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
TOLD HIM THAT "THE REPONSIBLE PERSONS, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE, WILL BE
PUNISHED."

ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE TO THE VERY END TO UNCOVER WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES."

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY BE MILITARY MEMBERS, HE
ANSWERED THAT "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMY, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE
THIS THOROUGHLY."

   HOWEVER, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE "PREMATURE INTERPRETATIONS" THAT
CLAIM THE MILITARY CARRIED OUT THE MULTIPLE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD THE SPANISH DIPLOMAT THAT THE
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR "WILL BE PEACEFUL IN A FEW DAYS," AND HE
REITERATED THAT HE "IS WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE."

   HOWEVER, HE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE ARE NOT GOING TO ATTEND A
MEETING THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED BY THE OTHER PARTY," REFERRING TO
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT PLANNING TO ATTEND THE
MEETING SLATED TO START ON 20 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, CRISTIANI INSISTS THAT THE SITUATION IS
"PRETTY MUCH CONTROLLED IN THE COUNTRY," ALTHOUGH THE SALVADORAN        
PRESIDENT WARNED THEM "THERE MIGHT BE NEW OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE."

SATURDAY NIGHT AS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR WAS CUT AND THE
COUNTRY ENTERED THE EIGHTH DAY OF A NATIONWIDE REBEL OFFENSIVE.

   INSURGENTS FROM THE LEFTIST FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) STILL HELD KEY POSITIONS AROUND THE CAPITAL, FENDING OFF
FIERCE SALVADORAN AIR AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS.

   THE POWER OUTAGE, WHICH HAD AFFECTED CERTAIN ZONES OF THE CITY AND
SURROUNDING SUBURBS BUT NOT THE ENTIRE CITY OVER THE PAST WEEK OF
FIGHTING, CAME AMID UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE ARMY WAS PREPARING A
MAJOR COUNTER-OFFENSIVE TO DRIVE THE REBELS FROM THE SAN SALVADOR
METROPOLITAN AREA.

   GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS BLOCKED ALL ACCESS TO THE REBEL-HELD NORTHERN
AND EASTERN SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL.

   THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS CONTINUED TO FLEE THE COMBAT ZONES, WHERE
A NUMBER HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE CROSS-FIRE SINCE THE LEFTIST FMLN
LAUNCHED ITS ATTACK NOVEMBER 11 -- THE BOLDEST OFFENSIVE OF THE
10-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

   INSURGENTS WHO THURSDAY HAD EVACUATED THE DISTRICT OF ZACAMIL --
DEVASTATED BY THE ARMED FORCES' AERIAL FIREBOMBINGS -- REGROUPED IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AN AREA NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO PRESS
REPORTS.

   FIGHTING WAS REPORTEDLY ALSO RAGING IN APOPA, 12 KILOMETERS (7.5
MILES) NORTH OF THE CAPITAL ON THE MAJOR NORTHERN ROUTE.

   IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, 140 KILOMETERS (87 MILES) EAST OF THE

BOMBING REBEL-OCCUPIED SECTIONS OF THE CITY.

NATIONAL GUARD, TREASURY POLICE, NATIONAL POLICE, AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT
BATTALIONS SUCH AS THE ATLCATL, ATONAL, ARCE, BELLOSO, AND BRACAMONTE,
AND BRIGADES BELONGING TO OUR GLORIOUS ARMED FORCES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
DEFEATED FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] MURDERERS TO
ENSURE THE FREEDOM AND TRANQUILLITY OF OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS.
WARLIKE OPERATIONS LAUNCHED IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH INVOLVED
GROUND AND AIR FORCES, WERE NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE AND

ELECTRICITY, ARE BEING PROVIDED NORMALLY AND ARE UNDER ARMED FORCES

FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER ROBERTO
ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER ROBERTO
ROCA, THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE JESUITS' [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE NOT
LONG IN COMING.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES WAS THE EDITORIAL OF
AN IMPORTANT U.S.  NEWSPAPER, THE NEW YORK TIMES, ON 18 NOVEMBER.  THE
EDITORIAL SAYS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT IF PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI DOES NOT ORDER A QUICK, THOROUGH, AND GENUINE INVESTIGATION
TO CATCH THE ASSASSINS, HE MIGHT LOSE THE UNITED STATES' ECONOMIC AID.

   THE EDITORIAL ALSO STATES THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE SAID THAT
THE MILITARY AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED IF EL SALVADOR CANNOT CONTROL AND
PUNISH THE DEATH SQUADS.  THEY ADD THAT IF HE DOES NOT HEED THE
WARNING, THE NEXT STATEMENT MIGHT BE ISSUED BY BOTH PARTIES.  WHAT ARE
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IMPORTANT STATEMENT BY AN INFLUENTIAL U.S.
NEWSPAPER FOR CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES?

   [ROCA] ACTUALLY, THE NEW YORK TIMES STATES THE FEELING PERVADING
THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.  IT IS A WAY OF CONFIRMING THAT THE FASCIST
GROUPS PREVAIL WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE], AND THEY ARE DECIDING THE REGIME'S POLICIES.
POLITICAL OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN SHAKEN BY
THIS MASSACRE PLANNED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. POLITICIANS WILL PROGRESSIVELY COME TO SUPPORT
THE U.S. PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND WILL DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT
ORDER THE INVESTIGATION.  WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL NOT BE EASY IN EL
SALVADOR, BECAUSE, AS THE EDITORIAL POINTS OUT, SIMILAR ASSASSINATIONS
HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED INNUMERABLE TIMES.  THESE CASES HAVE BEEN
SURROUNDED BY ABSOLUTE SECRECY; NO CULPRITS ARE FOUND; AND WITNESSES
HAVE TESTIFIED MANY TIMES THAT THE ACTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ARMED
FORCES MEMBERS, EITHER DRESSED AS CIVILIANS OR IN UNIFORM.  HOWEVER,
THE POLICY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTS THE
CULPRITS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CIVILIAN ASSASSINATION, MEANING THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FACT THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THE
LEADERS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT WERE SOUGHT OUT THAT SAME NIGHT TO BE
KILLED, PLUS THE FACT THAT THE KILLING OF THE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS WAS
CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GREAT BATTLES BEING FOUGHT IN
EL SALVADOR'S URBAN AREAS, WILL EVENTUALLY CONVINCE U.S.  POLITICIANS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING IS CLEARLY A FASCIST
GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN ANY KIND OF DEMOCRATIC
CONSOLIDATION.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] REAL LIFE IS MAKING IT EVIDENT THAT IN EL
SALVADOR WE MUST FIND A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS
BEING ENDURED -- TO THE WAR.  THIS DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION MEANS ISOLATING
AND EXCLUDING THE FASCISTS FROM POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST
DEMOCRACY.

   MR CRISTIANI CANNOT SAY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHARES NO
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.  IN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS
FRUSTRATED ATTEMPT TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, HE UNLEASHED THE
DOGS OF WAR -- ALL THE FASCIST ELEMENTS -- SO THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT
ALL THE OUTRAGES THEY HAVE COMMITTED.  THIS INCLUDES THE FASCIST
ELEMENTS IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEIR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE DEATH SQUADS, WHO WERE UNLEASHED
SO THEY WOULD MURDER PEOPLE WHO BEST EXPRESS THE DEMOCRATIC FEELINGS
OF THE PEOPLE AND, AS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, TO ELIMINATE
A VALUABLE SECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN INTELLIGENTSIA AT THE SERVICE OF
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

   AS WE ALL KNOW, THE JESUITS HAD CONTINUOUSLY DENOUNCED THE UNJUST
SYSTEM IN EL SALVADOR AND HAD CALLED FOR CLEARING UP ALL CRIMES.  THE
FASCISTS, IN THEIR HATRED, PUT AN END TO THE LIVES OF THESE JESUITS
BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN HIDE THE SUN WITH ONE FINGER.  THE INDIGNATION
OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL BE INCREASINGLY BACKED BY THE U.S.
PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THEIR INDIGNATION AND BY U.S.  POLITICIANS WHO
HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PUT AN END TO
FASCIST OUTRAGES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FASCISTS REPRESENT A BARRIER
THAT MUST BE DESTROYED AND DEFEATED TO HAVE DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, IF THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO CUT OFF
MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHAT IMPACT
WOULD THIS HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES WOULD HAVE LOST THE WAR SOME TIME AGO WERE IT NOT FOR U.S.
SUPPORT AND FINANCING.  AS WE HAVE STATED IN ALL OUR PROPOSALS FOR A
POLITICAL SOLUTION, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER THE DESTRUCTION NOR THE
ELIMINATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THE ARMED FORCES
TO GET RID OF THE FASCIST ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TURNED IT INTO A TOOL
THAT ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND DEMOCRACY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT SENSIBLE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, THOSE
WHO HAVE NOT LOST THEIR HEADS, MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION [WORDS
INDISTINCT] INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, THE POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, AND THE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE METHODS AND
TACTICS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [CONTINUED]

LABOR UNIONS, AND GENERAL PUBLIC ARE VERY STRONGLY REJECTING
CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE CONGRESSES AND PARLIAMENTS OF MANY WESTERN
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE SAYING THAT THE COOPERATION THE SALVADORAN
REGIME RECEIVES SHOULD BE REEVALUATED.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE SALVADOR SAMAYOA, THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS
REPORTING THAT U.S. AID TO CRISTIANI WILL CONTINUE.  THE COLONELS HAVE
ALSO SAID THAT THE FMLN CANNOT DEFEAT THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE THE
LATTER HAS MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
RETURNING TO THIS POINT, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?  WHAT
OPTIONS DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE CONCERNING EL SALVADOR, AND WHAT
IMPACT HAS THE NEW SITUATION HAD ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AS I SAID, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT A NEW INTERNAL SITUATION OF GENERALIZED POPULAR,
POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT IS TAKING SHAPE, AND THAT FROM THIS
MOMENT ON ITS POLICY IN EL SALVADOR WILL UNDERGO ISOLATION AND WILL BE
REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND EVEN BY VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS
WITHIN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

   SO FAR, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STUBBORNLY CONTINUED PROVIDING
AID AND SUPPORT TO A REGIME THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL AND GENOCIDAL,
AND THAT POLICY IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CURRENTLY A VERY STRONG DEBATE
IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
ARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING
TOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE
PROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL
TIME.  THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF
CRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER
DISCUSSION.  THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO
THE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE
CRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT
WORKING.

   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  HE SAID THE
GUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY
FIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400
WOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED.  ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST
BECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT
IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50
WAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR.  THAT
IS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM.  IN THE UNITED STATES
THE PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IS
IN FULL FORCE AND IS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT THE U.S.  POLICY IS
REACHING THE POINT OF TOTAL FAILURE.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON
RADIO VENCEREMOS TO THE COMRADES WHO HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS
IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND VARIOUS
POINTS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY?  WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE
FIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE?

   [SAMAYOA] TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO ARE FIGHTING IN TRENCHES
THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I MUST SAY THAT THE
AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION YOU HAVE GENERATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE
SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR STRUGGLE, AND THE SURPRISING STRENGTH AND HEROISM
YOU HAVE DISPLAYED ARE NOW RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM ALMOST ALL OF THE
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.  THEREFORE, OUR STRUGGLE NOT ONLY IS NOT
ALONE, BUT IT HAS NOW ACHIEVED MAXIMUM SUPPORT OF ALL TYPES:
POLITICAL, MATERIAL, ECONOMIC.  SOLIDARITY HAS MULTIPLIED HUNDREDFOLD
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND IT WILL BE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF
SUPPORT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLETING THE FASCIST REGIME'S
DESTRUCTION.  THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ADMIRE THE STRUGGLE THE COMRADES
AND FIGHTERS IN ALL THE CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WAGING, AND THEY
VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE IS FOR A JUST CAUSE AND
AGAINST A COMPLETELY ILLEGITIMATE, FASCIST, AND CRIMINAL REGIME.

   THE COMRADES CAN REST ASSURED OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH
IS CURRENTLY VERY GREAT.  IT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ALL OF THE AFFECTION
AND ADMIRATION THAT OUR FIGHTERS ARE RECEIVING FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SALVADOR.  OUR GREETINGS TO ALL THE
OTHER COMRADES.

   [SAMAYOA] THANK YOU, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION.  WE HAVE
REPORTS THAT THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING GOING ON IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN
SALVADOR AND IN APOPA.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS INTENSIFIED FIGHTING AGAINST SPECIAL BATTALIONS
IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE ALSO REPORT THAT DURING THIS FIGHTING IN SAN SALVADOR,
AT 1600 THIS AFTERNOON, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT CREWS DOWNED A SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE HELICOPTER.  WE HIT THE HELICOPTER NEAR SAQUIRO IN ARCE STREET AND IT
CRASHED.  WE ARE TO RECEIVE MORE DETAILS AND A REPORT ABOUT THE CREW'S FATE
LATER.

   WE REPEAT, A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER WAS DOWNED IN SAN
SALVADOR AT 1600 TODAY.  THIS IS THE SECOND HELICOPTER WE HAVE DOWNED
IN URBAN COMBAT.  AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR OFFENSIVE WE REPORTED THAT A
HELICOPTER HAD BEEN DOWNED AND ONE OF ITS PILOTS HAD BEEN KILLED.

   CLANDESTINE, 19 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY
FRONT, FMLN-FDR, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMRADE
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS ON STATEMENTS BY THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN SAN SALVADOR, WILLIAM WALKER, WHO SAID THAT DESPITE THE
BOMBINGS HIS GOVERNMENT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, WILL CONTINUE GIVING
MILITARY AID AND SUPPORT TO THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IT
SEEMS THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
JESUITS.  AT THIS MOMENT, HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVE THE NEW
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL
REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE
GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN
EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY
THE SALVADORAN ARMY AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY [UCA].  THERE HAVE BEEN VERY RADICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
EXPRESSING MUCH INDIGNATION BY VARIOUS U.S. SOCIAL SECTORS.  MOREOVER,
IN SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POLICE BARRICADES WERE BROKEN.
IMPORTANT U.S. POLITICAL PERSONALITIES SUCH AS JESSE JACKSON, ONE OF
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICIPATED IN THE
DEMONSTRATIONS.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN BOSTON,
CHICAGO, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOS ANGELES.  IN AT LEAST 20
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR
REPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S.
POLICY IN EL SALVADOR.

   SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF
IMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S.
MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CUT AND SUSPENDED.  SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG
STATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY
EXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN
SPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT
CARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE
MANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL
SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  AT THIS TIME, THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF
REPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE
WHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE [SALVADORAN] CRIMINAL
REGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED
IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON
POST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WHAT IS THE
SITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?

   [SAMAYOA] THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED.  IN THE
UNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAD GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE DEATH SQUADS
DID NOT LET HIM WORK.  THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S.
RELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS.
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF
COOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S.
NEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT]. AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN
EUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND
EVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO
EXPRESS REPUDIATION.  IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S
ROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
INTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
BECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS,
AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS
BEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL
CAPABILITIES.

   THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US.  THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION, AND THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BECOMING
INVOLVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS TO DEFEAT THE FASCISTS AND THE
GENOCIDAL TACTICS THEY ARE USING.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND COULD RESULT IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE
INSTITUTION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE ARMED FORCES THERE ARE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
WHO REJECT FASCISM.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DESERTIONS IN THE ARMY
FILES.  MANY ORDERS ARE BEING DISOBEYED, ORDERS OF A GENOCIDAL NATURE
USUALLY.  THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF AN EVENT THAT WILL STUN
POLITICAL OPINION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SAVAGE KILLING OF PEOPLE DOES NOT STOP, THE
MILITARY INSTITUTION WILL BE SIGNING ITS OWN DEATH SENTENCE.  THE
PEOPLE CANNOT TOLERATE A MILITARY THAT FUNCTIONS UNDER A MOST SAVAGE
AND DESPOTIC REGIME, AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS IN HOT WATER, WE
COULD SAY.

   THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS BEING DEVELOPED.
WE HAVE SOLID POSITIONS IN FOUR OF EL SALVADOR'S MAIN CITIES, AND AS
WE HAVE SAID BEFORE: NO ONE IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT.  VICTORY FOR
DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ASSURED.  THE WORLD WILL BACK US IN THE FACE OF THE
SAVAGE GENOCIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES, ESPECIALLY BY THE FASCIST
MILITARY ELEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER, THE FUNERAL RITES FOR THE THE
PRIESTS WHO WERE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS
MOMENT, AROUND NOON TIME, AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS WIFE ARE
ATTENDING THIS CEREMONY.  DO YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGE FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, FOR THE STUDENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY, FOR THE
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHO ARE MOURNING THE
DEATH OF THESE WORTHY JESUITS?

   [ROCA] WE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, AND I WILL REITERATE IT NOW, THE
DEEP SORROW OF THE FMLN MILITANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL OVER THE
LOSS OF THESE WORTHY JESUIT PRIESTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT
STRUGGLERS FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  WE SHARE THE
FEELINGS OF THE SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.

   I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CRISTIANI AT THE BURIAL
FOR THE JESUIT PRIESTS CALLS FOR A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY
IN DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ATROCIOUS ASSASSINATION.

   CRISTIANI CANNOT GO TO THAT BURIAL AND DO NOTHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO
WHOM HE OPENED DOORS SO THAT THEY COULD COMMIT THESE KILLINGS.
EVERYBODY MUST DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S
INDIGNATION BY PUNISHING THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.
CRISTIANI CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT HAVING MORAL AUTHORITY FOR ATTENDING THAT
BURIAL UNLESS HE PUNISHES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.  IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO PUNISH THE ASSASSINS.  THERE MUST BE A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF THE WAVE OF CRIME THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PAST 8 DAYS MANY COMMON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY
LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED.  THE BOMBING HAS BEEN INTENSE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING MUCH PAIN AND THEY DEMAND THAT THE
PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BE PUNISHED.

   WE AGAIN REITERATE THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE DEATH OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MUST BRAVELY AND
LOUDLY DEMAND JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THESE CRIMES.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 19 NOV 89 (ACAN) -- [EXCERPT] SAN SALVADOR,
19 NOV (ACAN-EFE) -- SALVADORAN CLERGYMEN FROM THE CATHOLIC, LUTHERAN,
AND BAPTIST CHURCHES HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE BEING "PERSECUTED" BY
GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STYLE OF THE ULTRARIGHTIST
"DEATH SQUADS"

   MEDARDO GOMEZ, A LUTHERAN CHURCH BISHOP, SAID TODAY THAT CLERGYMEN
ARE SUBJECT TO "PERSECUTION."  HE SAID THAT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE
FORCE ARE "BESIEGING" SHELTERS ESTABLISHED BY THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO
BENEFIT THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF THE FIGHTING.

   THE LUTHERAN BISHOP SAID THAT SIX GERMANS, FOUR U.S. CITIZENS, A
CANADIAN, AND A SPANIARD WERE ARRESTED BY THE TREASURY POLICE 2 DAYS
AGO IN A CHURCH IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE TROOPS WERE LOOKING FOR
"GUERRILLA COLLABORATORS."

   THE FOREIGNERS WERE DETAINED AFTER HAVING HELPED TO AID CIVILIANS
WHO TOOK REFUGE IN CHURCHES IN SAN SALVADOR AFTER FLEEING FROM THE
BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND REBELS IN THE MEJICANOS,
CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN JACINTO, AND SOYAPANGO
NEIGHBORHOODS, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL.

   SEVERAL PRIESTS, INCLUDING DANIEL LOPEZ, A SPANIARD, HAD TO
EVACUATE THEIR PARISHES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE EMBATTLED AREAS,
AFTER THE CHURCHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS.  LOPEZ HAD TO LEAVE
THE SANTA MARIA DE LOS POBRES CHURCH IN THE LA CHACRA SLUM AREA IN
EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER IT WAS BOMBED BY THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING
TO ONE OF LOPEZ' ASSISTANTS, WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD.

   RELIGIOUS SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT TREASURY POLICEMEN ASSAULTED
SOME 50 REFUGEES IN THE SAN ROQUE SHELTER, LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SAN
SALVADOR, WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR A PRIEST NAMED CORTEZ.

   THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAID THAT THE PERSECUTION WAS STEPPED UP
AFTER THE START OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL, WHICH BEGAN
ON 11 NOVEMBER AND SO FAR HAS LEFT SOME 1,000 DEAD, INCLUDING 6 JESUIT
PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

FORCE PLANE WHICH LEFT THE COUNTRY AT 1545 (2145 GMT) FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AT COMALAPA.

   SPANISH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER INOCENCIO ARIAS WAS ON BOARD THE
PLANE.

   THE AIRPLANE'S DEPARTURE WAS DELAYED TO WAIT FOR ARIAS AND OTHER
SPANISH OFFICIALS TO ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT AFTER ATTENDING THE FUNERAL
OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE KILLED ON

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE FOLLOWING IS AN
UPDATED REPORT OF THE MILITARY SITUATION.

   THE ARMED FORCES INFORM THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT THE AREAS IN SAN
SALVADOR WHERE ARMY TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATIONS ARE THE GUADALUPE AND LOS SANTOS NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
SOYOPANGO MUNICIPALITY, AND SAN SEBASTIAN [WORD INDISTINCT] AT CIUDAD
DELGADO.  THE ARMED FORCES EXPECT TO EXPEL THE REMAINING SMALL REBEL
REDOUBTS FROM THESE AREAS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THERE WERE
HARRASSMENT ACTIONS IN APOPA THIS MORNING, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE
REPORTED.  THE ARMY CONTROLS THE MEJICANOS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONTROL THE SITUATION IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY.  THE SITUATION IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY IS ALSO
UNDER CONTROL, EXCEPT FOR A FEW TERRORIST GROUPS CURRENTLY BEING
EXPELLED FROM THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL.

   THE ARMED FORCES JOINT COMMAND STAFF REPORTS THAT 840 TERRORISTS
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND 558 HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AS OF TODAY.  THE ARMY HAS
SUFFERED THE LOSS OF 220 SOLDIERS, WHO HEROICALLY OFFERED THEIR LIVES
TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND FROM COMMUNISM.  ALSO, 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED.

   THE FOLLOWING WAR MATERIEL HAS BEEN CONFICATED: 446 RIFLES OF
DIFFERENT CALIBERS, 87 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, [WORDS INDISTINCT], 22
MACHINEGUNS, 18 SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND
OTHER WAR MATERIEL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT] [GENERAL
RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS, SALVADORAN DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY
MINISTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY, THIS IS OUR
MISSION, AND WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE OUR LIVES IN SACRIFICE, AS HAS
BEEN PROVEN BY THE MANY HEROIC SOLDIERS WHO ARE DYING IN THIS STRUGGLE
TO DEFEND JUSTICE, PEACE, DEMOCRACY, AND THE WELL-BEING OF THESE
PEOPLE WHOM WE LOVE SO MUCH, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   ARMED FORCES, DO NOT FEAR THE ENEMY.  GO FORWARD WITH YOUR RESOLVE
AND SPIRIT.  OUR FAITH IN GOD AND OUR CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES GIVE US THE
TRUTH AND THE STRENGTH TO CONTINUE DESTROYING THE FORCES THAT ARE
TRYING TO WIPE OUT OUR HISTORY, TRADITION, VALUES, AND CITIZENS'
PRINCIPLES.

   FOR EACH OFFICER AND SOLDIER LOST IN THE STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO
OTHER MISSION BUT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY, TO DESTROY THE TERRORISTS'
PLANS, AND TO ONCE AND FOR ALL WIPE OUT THIS MANEUVER, THIS ATTEMPT TO
DESTROY THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF EL SALVADOR.

   THIS IS A TIMELY OCCASION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TO SAY THAT THE ARMED
FORCES AS AN INSTITUTION AT SOCIETY'S SERVICE DEEPLY REGRET AND HAVE
BEEN DISMAYED BY THE INCIDENTS AT THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.  WE CONDEMN, POINT AT, AND DEEPLY REJECT THESE
IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH ARE AIMED AGAINST SALVADORAN
INTELLECTUALS.  WE, LIKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, ALSO POINT TO, QUESTION, AND TOTALLY REJECT THESE ACTIONS
WHICH ONLY BRING MOURNING AND GRIEF AND, FURTHERMORE -- AS THE
TERRORIST FORCES HAVE DONE ON OTHER OCCASIONS -- CREATE CONFUSION,
DECEIT, AND FURTHER TORMENT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY
SUFFERED SO MUCH.

   THE ARMED FORCES CONVEY THEIR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL JESUIT COMMUNITY, AND WE ARE WILLING -- AS THE
GOVERNMENT HAS POINTED OUT -- TO CARRY OUT THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, SO
THAT SOONER OR LATER WE WILL FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SITUATION
AND APPLY TO THEM THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FOR SUCH IRRATIONAL,
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ONLY BRING GRIEF, TEARS, AND BLOOD TO OUR
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I BELIEVE THE TIME HAS COME TO FURTHER
DEMONSTRATE OUR STOICISM.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME TO DEFINE, IN A
TRUE CITIZEN'S SPIRIT, OUR RESOLVE TO DEFEAT, OUR RESOLVE TO WIN.
WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, A FEW HOURS, OR A FEW DAYS, WE WILL JOIN THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO CELEBRATE THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND
PEACE OVER THE IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN.

   THIS MAY ALSO BE A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO POINT TO THE TERRORIST
FORCES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO HURT OUR CIVILIAN POPULATION, TO TELL
THEM THAT THEIR CAUSE, THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE, IRRATIONALITY, AND
DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE'S WILL, IS LOST.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE ARMED
FORCES ARE URGING THE TERRORIST FORCES TO SURRENDER, TO LAY DOWN THEIR
WEAPONS, TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND TO JOIN CIVILIAN LIFE IN SOCIETY,
IN PEACE AND HARMONY, SO THAT WE ALSO -- AS THE ARMED FORCES AND AS AN
INSTITUTION -- CAN RESPECT THEIR LIVES AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO
SOCIETY, AND SO THAT TOGETHER -- TODAY, TOMORROW, AND ALWAYS -- WE CAN
BUILD A COUNTRY FULL OF LOVE, WELL- BEING, PEACE, AND FAITH IN GOD.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] EDUARDO COLORADO,
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF EL SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT THERE IS A PLAN,
POSSIBLY PREPARED BY THE GUERRILLAS, TO ATTACK SALVADORAN BISHOPS AND
"CREATE GREATER PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT" OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT "IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE
FOR THE BISHOPS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR NOT APPEAR IN PUBLIC."

   COLORADO, WHO DID NOT WANT WANT TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT
THE ALLEGED PLAN, SAID THAT THE MAIN TARGET MIGHT BE MSGR GREGORIO
ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SINCE SEVERAL OF HIS
RELATIVES ARE GUERRILLAS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERSONS
WHO HAVE LOST RELATIVES IN THE WAR "MIGHT CARRY OUT THE PLAN" THAT
"MIGHT BE ORGANIZED BY THE TERRORISTS TO CREATE A GREATER CRISES FOR
THE GOVERNMENT."

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO POPE JOHN PAUL II
ASKING HIM TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY THE BISHOPS WHO REPORTEDLY
SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S CHURCH."  ACCORDING TO COLORADO, THIS
"PEOPLE'S CHURCH" IS RESPONSIBLE IN PART FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY.

   HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH BISHOPS ARE MENTIONED IN THE LETTER SENT
TO THE POPE, BUT VARIOUS SOURCES INSIST HE IS REFERRING TO ARCHBISHOP
ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP ROSA CHAVEZ, WHO SUPPORT A
POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.

   IN THE LETTER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUGGESTS THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II
REMOVE THESE SALVADORAN BISHOPS SINCE, HE INSISTS, "IT IS 1,000 TIMES
BETTER TO PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS THAN TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM."

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTER TO THE POPE WAS SENT 2 DAYS AFTER SIX
JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN) AND TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED
IN SAN SALVADOR BY A GROUP OF 30 TO 40 MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS,
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE ARMED FORCES
MAINTAIN CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  AFTER 6 [NUMBER AS HEARD] DAYS OF INTENSE
BATTLES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SHOWN
THEIR PROFESSIONALISM BY ACHIEVING TOTAL CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  THE
LOCATIONS WHERE THERE WERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS -- THE SLOPES OF SAN JACINTO
HILL IN THE SOUTH AND SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD DELGADO, MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL --
HAVE BEEN RETAKEN BY THE ARMY DURING THE WEEKEND.  EVEN THOUGH THE ARMY HAD
DISLODGED THE MARXIST - LENINISTS FROM MEJICANOS, CIVILIAN ACCESS TO THAT
AREA HAS NOT BEEN PERMITTED BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS MINED THE ENTRANCES TO
SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND SEVERAL HOUSES OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COOPERATE
WITH THEM.  IN CIUDAD DELGADO, ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS FOUGHT SMALL GROUPS OF
GUERRILLAS WHO HAD HIDDEN IN HOUSES AND WHO PUT UP SOME RESISTANCE, WHICH
WAS QUICKLY CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE ARMED FORCES MAINTAIN
ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER AMATEPEC AND CIUDAD CREDISA NEIGHBORHOODS.

   ONWARD BRAVE SOLDIERS.  CONTINUE FIGHTING TO KEEP OUR FATHERLAND
FREE WITH GUARANTEES FOR ALL HONEST SALVADORANS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST WEEK, IS SLOWLY RETURNING
TO NORMAL.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 9 DAYS MANY BUSINESSES AND
WORKPLACES OPENED THEIR DOORS AND MANY BUSES WERE OPERATING.  AFTER
MANY DAYS IN WHICH MOST VEHICLES ON THE STREETS WERE AMBULANCES,
OFFICIAL OR MILITARY VEHICLES, AND VEHICLES BELONGING TO NEWSMEN, THE
CAPITAL AWAKENED TODAY TO HEAVY TRAFFIC WITH BUSES, TAXIS, TRUCKS, AND
PRIVATE VEHICLES.

   THE 24-HOUR "CURFEW" DECREED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN THE DENSELY
POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS
IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR WAS SUSPENDED, SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT AFLREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT.

   THE "STATE OF SIEGE" AND "CURFEW," HOWEVER, WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT,
FROM 1800 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING.

   IN TWO OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL, GUERRILLA REDOUBTS
AND SOLDIERS HAVE CONTINUED TO CLASH, PARTICULARLY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOODS OF APOPA, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO.

   PRIVATE VEHICLES CANNOT OPERATE IN MUCH OF MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOOD,
ONE OF THE MAIN GUERRILLA BASTIONS LAST WEEK, AS A RESULT OF THE
TRENCHES DUG BY THE REBELS AND DEBRIS PILED ON THE STREETS FROM
DESTROYED BUILDINGS AND HOMES.

   THE SITUATION IS ALSO RETURNING TO NORMAL IN SOME PARTS OF THE
INTERIOR, EXCEPT FOR SOME CITIES SUCH AS SAN MIGUEL IN THE EAST AND
ZACATECOLUCA IN THE SOUTH WHERE THERE IS STILL FIERCE FIGHTING IN
WHICH ELITE ARMY UNITS ARE INVOLVED.

   IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANTARIAN ASSISTANCE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING THE TASKS OF CLEANING UP THE RUBBLE AND
REBUILDING THOUSANDS OF HOMES AFFECTED BY THE FIGHTING AND BOMBING,
ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS.  INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS
SOURCES SAID THAT SOME 50,000 PERSONS HAVE HAD TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES
AND ARE LODGED IN CHURCHES, STADIUMS, SCHOOLS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS SET
UP AS TEMPORARY LODGINGS.

   INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO ARRIVE
BRINGING FIRST AID FOR THE MANY CIVILIANS WHO WERE WOUNDED AND ARE
BEING TREATED IN THE HOSPITALS WHERE HUNDREDS OF THE MORE THAN 1,000
WHO WERE TREATED LAST WEEK REMAIN, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN HOSPITAL
SOURCES.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANO REPORTED ON A RADIO AND TELEVISION
NETWORK THAT "A FEW REDOUBTS" GUERRILLA REDOUBTS REMAIN, THAT THE
ARMED FORCES HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE, AND THAT "THE SITUATION WILL
BE TOTALLY CONTROLLED SOON."

   HE SAID THAT THE WAR VICTIMS WILL BE GIVEN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND
THAT HIS CABINET WILL IMPLEMENT "RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS," WITH WHICH
HE INVITED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COOPERATE.

   THE STATE RADIO IS CELEBRATING THE "DEFEAT OF THE RED HORDES" OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN A TONE OF
RESOUNDING VICTORY, CONSTANTLY RENDERING TRIBUTE TO THE LEADERS AND
SOLDIERS OF THE BATTALIONS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN EXPELLING THE
GUERRILLAS FROM THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES.

   "THE TERRORISTS FLED IN DISARRAY," ACCORDING TO THE STATE RADIO,
WHICH COMMENTED ON THE MILITARY SITUATION THAT CIRCLES CLOSE TO THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] INTERPRETED
AS A "TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL."

   THE FIGHTING AND BOMBINGS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY HAVE LEFT A TOLL OF MORE THAN 1,000 DEAD, HUNDREDS WOUNDED,
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HOMELESS.


DEV-MUC3-0823 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] A FRIEND OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON THE SCENE, SAID THAT HE
COUNTED SOME 500 OR 600 BULLET HOLES.  HE SAID THAT THESE SHOTS WERE
FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE, WITH A MACHINEGUN SET UP ON A TRIPOD.  THE
PRIESTS WERE ALSO LATER SHOT IN A GARDEN NEARBY.  ACCORDING TO
INFORMATION THAT THE SOCIETY OF JESUS RECEIVED FOLLOWING THEIR OWN
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CRIME, WHICH THEY HAVE RELEASED TO THE
AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THE CASE, THE KILLERS, APPROXIMATELY 30 MEN
IN UNIFORM, ARRIVED SHORTLY BEFORE 0230.  THEY MACHINEGUNNED THE HOUSE
BEFORE ENTERING, DRAGGED THE PRIESTS OUT, PUT THEM IN FRONT OF A WALL
THAT IS STILL STAINED WITH BLOOD, AND SHOT THEM.  THE PRIESTS WERE
ALSO SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A LONG-RANGE WEAPON; HOWEVER, THESE SHOTS
WERE FIRED FROM SOME DISTANCE.  A LAWYER, HELPING IN THE INVESTIGATION
OF THIS CASE AND WHO HAS ASKED TO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, SAID THAT THIS
WAS DETERMINED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO GUNPOWDER MARKS ON THE VICTIMS.

   AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS CARRIED OUT, A CURFEW WAS BEING OBSERVED
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE HOUSE WHERE THE
PRIESTS LIVED WAS SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS.  TOGETHER WITH THIS
INFORMATION, GATHERED BY SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROMINENT PERSONS TO
PROVE THAT THE MURDER WAS CARRIED OUT BY SOLDIERS, WE MUST STRESS THAT
THE HOUSE WAS ALSO SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS 2 DAYS BEFORE THE CRIME
WAS COMMITTED.  A JESUIT PRIEST WHO WAS DESCRIBING THE SCENE SAID THAT
ONLY THE AREA PREVIOUSLY SEARCHED BY THE SOLDIERS WAS DESTROYED.  HE
SAID THAT THE LIBRARY WAS BURNED AND THE ROOMS HAD BEEN RANSACKED.
ACCORDING TO THE PRIEST, $5,000 THAT FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA HAD
RECEIVED IN BARCELONA -- PART OF AN AWARD GIVEN THE UNIVERSITY -- WERE
TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS.

   THE USE OF LONG-RANGE WEAPONS WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE BRAINS OF
THE DEAD WERE SCATTERED ABOUT.  THIS WAS SEEN BY THE FIRST PERSONS WHO
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  OTHERS SAID THAT THE BODIES WERE DESTROYED
BECAUSE AK-47 AND M-16 ASSAULT RIFLES WERE USED IN THE ATTACK.  THE
BODIES WERE SO UTTERLY DESTROYED THAT EMBALMING WAS NOT POSSIBLE.
THIS WAS REPORTED TO ACAN-EFE BY SOCIETY OF JESUS SUPERIOR JOSE MARIA
TOJEIRA.

   REGARDING THE TWO MURDERED WOMEN, THE COOK ELBA JULIA RAMOS AND HER
15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MARISELA, ALL INDICATES THAT THEY WERE
MACHINEGUNNED IN THE SMALL ROOM WHERE THEY SLEPT. THERE WAS SO MUCH
BLOOD THAT IT SEEPED UNDER THE DOOR, AND A VERTEBRA AND PIECES OF A
SKULL CAN STILL BE SEEN UNDER A SOFA IN THE SMALL ROOM.  THE
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE NOT
TORTURED AS EARLIER REPORTS HAD STATED.

   MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REPORTEDLY SAID
YESTERDAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT RULED OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE KILLERS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS COULD HAVE BEEN
SOLDIERS.  THEY HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOLDIERS COULD
HAVE KILLED THE PRIESTS, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
INCIDENT AND PUNISH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  THIS WAS SAID BY THE
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT IN STATEMENTS TO ACAN-EFE AND OTHER FOREIGN NEWS
AGENCIES.  CRISTIANI, WHO INSISTED ON THE NEED TO AVOID UNFOUNDED
CONCLUSIONS, ADDED THAT THE MILITARY DOES NOT THINK IT WILL BE
AFFECTED BY SOMETHING DONE BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

   WE CAN CLEARLY SEE NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTRADICTIONS.  AT THIS
MOMENT THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THERE IS THE POSITION OF U.S.
AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER -- HE IS LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH ITS HEAD
BURIED IN THE SAND.  THERE IS PROOF THAT RULES OUT ALL DOUBT.  HOW CAN
40 MEN IN UNIFORM BE IN A MILITARIZED AREA FOR 60 MINUTES AND NOT HEAR
SHOTS BEING FIRED AND BOMBS EXPLODING?  WHY DID THE ARMY NOT SEND IN
TROOPS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE'S OFFICE?  THE 40 MEN WERE IN THE AREA FOR A WHOLE HOUR.
THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED FATHER ELLACURIA'S HOME.

   OUR QUESTION FOR WILLIAM WALKER: IF THIS WAS NOT DONE BY THE ARMED
FORCES, THEN WHY WERE THEY THERE SEARCHING THE PREMISES FOR A WHOLE
HOUR AND EVEN STEALING $5,000?  THEY SEARCHED DRAWER BY DRAWER.  THE
DISORDER THEY LEFT BEHIND WAS QUITE EVIDENT IN THE CLIPS SHOWN ON
TELEVISION.  THEY SEARCHED THE AREA FOR AN HOUR TO SEE WHAT THEY, THE
MURDERERS, COULD FIND TO STEAL.  HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER
SAYS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ARMY COMMITTED THE CRIME.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0824 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] AS WE SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THIS
PROVES THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING THIS CASE.  THERE IS
WILLIAM WALKER, ACTING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN THE
GROUND.  AND THERE IS CRISTIANI'S POSITION -- THE DEATH SQUAD MEMBER
WHO WEARS A TIE, WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT] AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WHO SAID THAT RASH JUDGMENT SHOULD
NOT BE PASSED AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY TO ACCUSE THE
GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE.  AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND
DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN.  WHY?  IF IT IS TRUE THAT
THERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE
DEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING
CRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID?  WHO GIVES THE
ORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI?  IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN
THE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING
ACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD.  HOWEVER, THIS IS
NOT THE CASE.

   THIS FURTHER PROVES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING.  THE CIVILIAN MASK
FELL ON SATURDAY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HOLDS THE REAL POWER IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE
THE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] FOLLOWERS OR OTHER
CIVILIANS.  THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,
IMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE
HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF
KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE
POINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO
IT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF
THE KILLERS.  THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID
IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] NO DOUBT, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT.
WE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE
ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION.  HOWEVER, NOT A
SINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S
JUSTICE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND
CRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME
ACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE
DEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE
U.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID
THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE
FMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS
APPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE
MASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR
HOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE
KILLED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] RELIABLE SOURCES
HAVE INFORMED THE NATIONAL NETWORK THAT GUILLERMO ROJAS, THE LEFTIST TRADE
UNION LEADER, DIED IN SOYAPANGO MUNICIPALITY WHERE HEAVY COMBAT BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
CRIMINAL TERRORISTS HAS TAKEN PLACE.  GUILLERMO ROJAS WAS ONE OF THE TOP
LEADERS OF THE TRADE UNION OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE WORKERS,
STISS, AND FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST UNTS [NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN
WORKERS], A FRONT FOR THE MARXIST-LENINIST FMLN GROUPS.

ROJAS' DEATH HAVE YET TO BE CLARIFIED.


DEV-MUC3-0826 (PRC)

   CLANDESTINE, 20 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] HERE IS A VERY
IMPORTANT POINT THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER SHOULD TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.  AMBASSADOR WALKER SEEMS TO BE A VERY BAD INVESTIGATOR, AS HE
IS STILL IN THE DARK AS REGARDS THE COWARDLY MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.
AFTER THE FUNERAL OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR STILL EXPRESSED
DOUBTS REGARDING THE AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME.

   WELL, WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT STATING THAT THE MURDERERS OF THE
JESUITS FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS AND STAYED IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE
SLAIN PRIESTS FOR 1 HOUR.  IN OTHER WORDS, 40 MEN IN THE UNIFORM OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMY WERE A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE GENERAL STAFF
PARTICIPATING IN SHOOTING THAT LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES, AND REMAINED IN
THERE FOR 1 HOUR, IN AN AREA UNDER THE ARMY'S CONTROL, IN AN AREA
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL STAFF.

   WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE U.S. AMBASSADOR.  HOW COULD 40 MEN IN
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES UNIFORMS, AND WITH POLICE AND ARMY PATROLS
ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY FROM THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE, REMAIN IN THAT
PLACE FOR 1 HOUR IF THEY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES?

   AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY SHAME, TELL THE
WORLD AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION: IF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF DID
NOT KILL THE JESUIT PRIESTS, HOW COULD THE MURDERERS -- AS THIS
INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH SAYS -- REMAIN IN THE RESIDENCE FOR 1 HOUR
AFTER THE HEAVY SHOOTING, AFTER KILLING THE PRIESTS WITH MACHINEGUNS
IN TRIPODS, AS THE CABLE SAYS?

   WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH WHICH IS BEING READ ALL OVER THE WORLD.
MAYBE WILLIAM WALKER DOES NOT EVEN READ INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES,
BECAUSE HE CYNICALLY SAID AFTER THE PRIESTS' FUNERAL THAT HE HAD NO
EVIDENCE OR INDICATION THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE ARMED
FORCES.  WELL, AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER, WE WILL READ THIS DISPATCH
TO YOU:

   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] IN UNIFORM WHO KILLED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND
TWO COMPANIONS IN SAN SALVADOR ON THURSDAY FIRED MORE THAN 500 SHOTS
AND REMAINED AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR.  WE REPEAT:
THEY WERE IN THE PRIESTS' RESIDENCE FOR ALMOST 1 HOUR, ACCORDING TO
PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE FUNERAL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME REVEALS SOME
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING THE MACHINEGUNNING OF THE PRIESTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE THREE SPANISH
MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, FREED TODAY BY THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARD, SAID THAT THE AUTHORITIES ORDERED THEM TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH
"TERRORIST DELINQUENTS."

   "WE ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY," SAID FRANCES RIERA, ONE
OF THE SPANIARDS DETAINED THIS MORNING TOGETHER WITH HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN ESTHER DOMENECH AND LUIS PEREZ, A GUATEMALAN UNDER REFUGE
AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH, AND ANOTHER THREE FOREIGNERS -- A COLOMBIAN,
A CANADIAN, AND AN AMERICAN.

   RIERA SAID THEY WERE DETAINED AT 1005 GMT, WHILE THE CITY WAS
"UNDER CURFEW" AND UNDER A "STATE OF SIEGE," AND THAT NATIONAL GUARD
MEMBERS "KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, ENTERED, SEPARATED US, TOOK THE
FOREIGNERS ASIDE, AND DELIVERED US AN ANTICOMMUNIST HARANGUE."

   "THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ARRESTING US FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION BECAUSE
FOREIGNERS WERE BEING THREATENED BY TERRORIST DELINQUENTS.  AT THE
NATIONAL GUARD WE WERE MADE TO SIGN A STATEMENT IN WHICH WE APPEAR AS
SUSPECTS OF COLLABORATING WITH TERRORIST DELINQUENTS," RIERA ADDED.

   THE THREE SPANIARDS ARE AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AFTER AMBASSADOR
FRANCISCO CADIZ IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION TO GET THEM FREED.

   A TOTAL OF 15 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED, NINE OF THEM SALVADORANS, AND
WE "KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS," RIERA SAID.  HE ADDED THAT
THEY HAD REMAINED IN DETENTION FOR OVER 1 HOUR, STRESSING THAT "WE
WERE NEVER MISTREATED NOR WERE WE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS."

   RIERA SAID THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 135 PEOPLE AT THE EPISCOPAL
CHURCH WHO WERE LEFT HOMELESS BY THE WAR, AND MORE ARE EXPECTED TODAY.

   "PEOPLE HAVE TO REMAIN THERE (AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH) BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.  THERE ARE NO PLACES LEFT AFTER THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE BOMBINGS," RIERA STRESSED.

   HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH "HAS EVIDENCE THAT WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS
WERE SET ON FIRE."

   RIERA REPORTED THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST "ARMED MEN, DRESSED IN
MILITARY UNIFORMS," ENTERED HIS HOME AND "INTIMIDATED US."

   THE THREE FREED SPANIARDS WILL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
MADRID, VIA GUATEMALA, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN
SALVADOR REPORTED.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 18 NOV 89 (MOSCOW PRAVDA) -- [TEXT] THE MAIN COMMAND OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS EXPRESSED SERIOUS
CONCERN AT THE DIRECT U.S. INTERFERENCE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  ON
FRIDAY THE NORTHERN QUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL SAN SALVADOR WERE ONCE
AGAIN SUBJECTED TO MASSIVE BOMBARDMENTS BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT IN WHICH U.S.
PILOTS TOOK PART, A REPORT FROM THE INSURGENT "VENCEREMOS" RADIO STATION
SAYS.  ACCORDING TO FMLN INTELLIGENCE DATA, U.S. PILOTS ARRIVED IN EL
SALVADOR 13 NOVEMBER AND ARE TAKING PART IN COMBAT OPERATIONS CONDUCTED BY
ARMY SUBUNITS IN DENSELY POPULATED QUARTERS OF THE CAPITAL.

   APPROXIMATELY 500 HOMES IN THE CAPITAL'S SAKAMIL [NAME AS
TRANSLITERATED] QUARTER WERE DESTROYED AS A RESULT OF BOMB STRIKES AND
MISSILE BOMBARDMENT BY SALVADORAN AIRCRAFT, JOURNALISTS ACCREDITED IN
THIS COUNTRY REPORTED OVER THE TELEPHONE.  THEY ATTEST THAT THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE ARE USING MISSILES AND, PROBABLY, NAPALM.

   WASHINGTON DC (UNITED STATES), 21 NOV 89 (MOSCOW TASS) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES INTENDS TO
CONTINUE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE SCENE OF FIERCE
CLASHES RECENTLY BETWEEN SALVADOREAN INSURGENTS AND THE PRO-AMERICAN
REGIME'S ARMY.

   SPEAKING AT THE ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, MARYLAND, ON MONDAY, THE
PRESIDENT STRONGLY CRITICISED THE PREVAILING CONGRESSIONAL SENTIMENTS
IN FAVOUR OF THE TERMINATION OF AID TO THE SALVADOREAN GOVERNMENT.

   "THIS CONCEPT OF THE CONGRESS, OF SOME MEMBERS -- TALKING ABOUT
CUTTING OFF AID TO EL SALVADOR IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AS
PRESIDENT." HE SAID.

   "WE SUPPORT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS EFFORTS TO RESTORE ORDER,"
BUSH SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT, FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY, OF BEING
FINANCED BY "MARXISTS".  MEANWHILE THE VOLUME OF WASHINGTON'S MILITARY
AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADOREAN REGIME IS KNOWN TO EXCEED 1.5
MILLION DOLLARS.

   "TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES AROUND -- A VERY SMALL
HANDFUL -- SUPPORTING THE OUTDATED CONCEPT OF MARXIST GUERRILLAS, IS
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES," THE PRESIDENT SAID.  "AND I AM TO
TELL THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL NOT ACCEPT, AS
PRESIDENT, A CUT OFF OF AID TO EL SALVADOR," HE SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID "WE CANNOT CONDONE KILLING" IN EL SALVADOR,
IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE NOTORIOUS "DEATH SQUADS", PARAMILITARY
EXTREME RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS, HAVE KILLED SCORES OF THOUSANDS OF
CIVILIANS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  CIVILIANS, SUSPECTED OF LINKS WITH
GUERRILLAS, ARE IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED, THE AMERICAN PRESS HAS REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, THERE ARE 55 AMERICAN MILITARY
ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOME OF THEM INVOLVED IN TERRORISTIC "DEATH
SQUAD" OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS MANY U.S. SECRET SERVICE EMPLOYEES.

HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  THE FMLN ENSURES THE SAFETY OF ALL FOREIGNERS WHO MAY BE

DOES NOT TAKE HOSTAGES.  THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD TAKE HOSTAGES, WE
ARE NOT TERRORISTS.  WE DO NOT HOLD FOREIGNERS HOSTAGE AS SOME U.S. NEWS
AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.

   WE WILL BE RELEASING A COMMUNIQUE ON THIS MATTER SHORTLY.  HOWEVER,
WE WISH TO STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT TAKE HOSTAGES.  THE FOREIGN
DISPATCHES RELEASED ARE GROUNDLESS.  THE DISPATCHES STATE THAT THE
FMLN IS HOLDING FOREIGNERS HOSTAGE.  THAT IS NOT TRUE; WE DO NOT TAKE
HOSTAGES, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY.  WE ARE CLARIFYING THIS FOR THE
DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE DO NOT WANT THEM TO
BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THE INFORMATION BEING RELEASED BY FOREIGN NEWS
AGENCIES.

   THERE ARE NO HOSTAGES, TAKING HOSTAGES IS NOT OUR POLICY.  IF A
FOREIGN CITIZEN -- U.S. CITIZEN OR ANY OTHER FOREIGNER -- IS TRAPPED
IN AREAS OF CONFLICT, THE FMLN WILL ENSURE HIS SAFETY.  OUR FIGHTERS
HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO PROTECT THE PHYSICAL INTEGRITY OF ANY CITIZEN
AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE WISH TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE NO HOSTAGES, IT IS NOT THE
FMLN POLICY TO HOLD HOSTAGES.

TERRORIST GROUPS TO KIDNAP OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO CLEMENTE BAENA
SOARES, WHO WAS STAYING AT THE EL SALVADOR SHERATON HOTEL, IN THE

   TROOPS OF THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION AND THE CAVALRY REGIMENT,
SUPPORTED BY THE AIR FORCE, SURROUNDED THE AREA WHILE TWO GROUPS OF
SPECIALLY TRAINED UNITS ENTERED THE HOTEL.  THE FIRST GROUP PROVIDED
MAXIMUM PROTECTION TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS OAS SECRETARY GENERAL, WHILE THE
SECOND GROUP OVERPOWERED THE GROUP OF EXTREMISTS WHO HAD ENTERED THE

FERNANDO CASTRO, A MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION

WELL, WE BELIEVE THAT TODAY IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE
REMARKS OF COMRADE CASTRO OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] IN THIS PROGRAM.  I CONSIDER IT PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THE LATEST REPORTS WE ARE RECEIVING STATE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
ARE CARRYING OUT A TACTICAL RETREAT, A TACTICAL REDEPLOYMENT.  I WOULD
LIKE TO ASK YOU, CASTRO, WHAT THE OBJECTIVES BEHIND THIS TACTICAL
RETREAT OR REDEPLOYMENT OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT ARE.

   [CASTRO) FOLLOWING 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE REGIME CONDUCTED
CRIMINAL BOMBINGS, GOING AS FAR AS USING PHOSPHOROUS BOMBS, AND TO
AVOID FURTHER LOSS OF CIVILIAN LIVES, THAT IS, OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL
RETREAT IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE ITS FORCES TO CONTINUE TO STRIKE IN
OTHER PLACES AGAINST THE ENEMY: THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   [AGUDO] CASTRO, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER
HAS ALREADY ENDED?

   [CASTRO] NO. THE POLITICAL-MILITARY MANEUVER CONTINUES.  THE
OBJECTIVE IS TO OPEN AREAS FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO
CREATE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO DISLODGING THAT CRIMINAL
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TODAY MAKING OUR PEOPLE SUFFER.

   [AGUDO] AFTER NEARLY 10 DAYS OF FIGHTING, DOES THE FMLN CONSIDER
THAT THE OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVE?

   [CASTRO] WE BELIEVE THAT THIS OPERATION HAS ACHIEVED SEVERAL
OBJECTIVES.  IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE HAVE SHOWN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND
THE WORLD OUR POLITICAL, MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC CAPABILITIES.  THE
ENEMY CLAIMED THAT WE ARE WEAK.  THEY EVEN STATED THAT IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FMLN TO HOLD A POSITION IN SAN SALVADOR FOR 1 DAY.
WE HAVE HELD MORE THAN 10 POSITIONS FOR 10 DAYS AND THEY HAD TO USE
ALL OF THE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS DELIVERED TO THEM BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT TO FORCE US TO RETREAT, TO CARRY OUT A TACTICAL MANEUVER IN
ORDER TO AVOID MORE DEATHS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS
IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL ITSELF.

   [AGUDO] WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE THING: THERE IS A GROUP OF
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS, OF REBEL FORCES THAT ARE RETREATING FROM THE
CAPITAL.  ISN'T THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN A POSITION TO SURROUND THEM, TO
ANNIHILATE THEM?

   [CASTRO] NO. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ARMY TO SURROUND OR TO
ANNIHILATE OUR COMRADES.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED OUR GREAT MANEUVERING
SKILLS IN THE COURSE OF THIS WAR.  WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN BROKEN
SIEGES, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ANNIHILATE US.  I REPEAT, WE
HAVE JUST RETREATED IN ORDER TO RELOCATE OUR FORCES IN PLACES THAT
WOULD ENABLE US TO DEAL EVEN HARDER BLOWS TO THE ENEMY.  [CONTINUED]

THAT:

   1.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR A CEASE-FIRE, AS
REQUESTED BY THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL,
THE GROUP OF EIGHT, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EEC, CANADA, THE SOVIET
UNION, SWEDEN, AND FINLAND, IS A FAIR DEMAND FOR HUMANITARIAN AND
POLITICAL REASONS AND IS AIMED AT STOPPING THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES AS
WELL AS PREVENTING BLOODLETTING BETWEEN THE TWO SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES;

   2.  THE BRUTAL AERIAL AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED MOSTLY
CIVILIAN VICTIMS IN THE LOW-INCOME DISTRICTS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF
THOUSANDS OF HOMES;

   3.  A MANHUNT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED FOR THE LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF
TRADE UNIONS, RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OPPOSITION
POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN MURDERS, CAPTURES, SEARCHES,
AND PERSECUTION, THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE, AND OTHER
VICTIMS OF THE PERSECUTION HAVE GONE UNDERGROUND OR LEFT THE COUNTRY,
GIVING RISE -- BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS PER SE AND THE CONCEALMENT OF
TRUTH -- TO A CLIMATE OF STATE TERRORISM;

   4.  A POSTPONEMENT OF THE CEASE-FIRE WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DAMAGE
TO THE SALVADORAN POPULATION AND MORE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS, AND THIS
WOULD NOT ALLOW CONDITIONS TO BE CREATED TO END THE WAR IN THE CITIES,
THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND SAN SALVADOR'S METROPOLITAN AREA;

   5.  THERE ARE SECTORS IN THE ARMED FORCES, ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE], PCN [NATIONAL CONCILIATION PARTY], MAC [AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN
MOVEMENT], AND IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WANT A PROLONGATION OF THE
WAR AND, THEREFORE, OPPOSE A CEASE-FIRE; AND

   6.  WE ARE ACTING WITH FLEXIBILITY, GUIDED BY THE NATION'S
PATRIOTIC INTERESTS, THE SITUATION OF TRUE EMERGENCY THAT HAS BEEN
CREATED, AND THE DESIRE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED
CONFLICT, AND BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL, MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC
POLARIZATION, IT IS URGENT THAT ALL FORCES ACT SWIFTLY AND TAKE STEPS
TO PUT A DEFINITIVE END TO THE WAR,

   THEREFORE:

   1.  WE STATE OUR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF A CEASE-FIRE UNDER
VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND OF THE

DEMANDING PEACE.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  IS THIS IS THE DEMOCRACY YOU PEOPLE
WANT TO EXIST HERE?  BUT YOU PEOPLE ARE WRONG, MR.  WALKER.  IT WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE HERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE A VOLCANO IN ERUPTION.  WHOEVER PUTS
HIS HAND IN THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED, MR.  WALKER.  STOP STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.  YOU SHOULD RATHER SEND AWAY, ONCE AND FOR
ALL, THOSE COUNTRYMEN OF YOURS WHO HAVE BEEN SENT HERE AS ADVISERS.  THEY

ADVICE FOR YOU.  UNDERSTAND ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND IN
THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED.  THE LAVA OF THIS ERUPTING VOLCANO IS BOILING,
MR.  WALKER.  UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK.  ALL
FOR PEACE.

   WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING.  U.S.  PENTAGON
MILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT
THEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE
CAPABILITIES.  A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED
OVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.  THE FMLN ACTIONS
OF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN
MILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S.  OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN
MANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE.

   THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  SOME ANALYSTS VIEW
THE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE
THE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS
IF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  EL SALVADOR IS LIVING
THROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED
IN SOCIAL INJUSTICE.  THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A
REARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
FMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES.  THEY HAVE GAINED
GROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE.  THE FMLN DOES NOT
FORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS
RANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT.  TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN
GOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE.

   BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC
OPPORTUNITIES IN [EL] SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER
OPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN
THE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND
UNEMPLOYMENT.  TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO
TAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY.  THAT IS THE HISTORY
OF THE FMLN.

   THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
THE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' [ARMED] FORCES IS NOT
COMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES.  THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES,
BOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY
ARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE
ARMY'S.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE
[UNITED] STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND
AMMUNITION.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS.  HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT--
BY FIGHTING.  WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES.  EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS.  THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN
SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE
ORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD
POSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS.  THE
FMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON.  OUR FRONT
HAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY.  BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND
TACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS.  THE [ARMED] FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN
REGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS [WORDS INDISTINCT], SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
THE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED
TO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER.  ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND
DEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID.  THIS IS
WHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO
FACE THE ONE USED BY THE [ARMED] FORCES.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED
GREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN
COMBAT IN [SAN] SALVADOR AND [SAN] MIGUEL.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE
BEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN;
SOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED.

    MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO
LONG IN AN URBAN AREA.  IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION.  THE [ARMED] FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH
THE ILOPANGO [AIR] BASE.  THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION
BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT.  THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED
BY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY.  THEY DID NOT
WARN THE [ARMED] FORCES.  WHY?  BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SEE IN THESE GUERRILLA
COLUMNS THEIR OWN ARMY.

   LECHEVALIER TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS "SUPPORT ALL
EFFORTS THAT WILL HELP ATTAIN SOON AND END TO HOSTILITIES, AND THE
START TO NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL BRING PEACE TO EL SALVADOR, A PEACE WE
NEED SO BADLY."

   THE FORMER CULTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER AND PDC LEADER SAID
HE AGREES THE ARMY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, "TO CLEAR
UP MATTERS INHERENT TO THE MILITARY -- WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT LAST NIGHT ANNOUNCED
IT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "IMMEDIATELY" A CEASE-FIRE WITH UN
VERIFICATION, AND TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE ARMED FORCES THE END OF THE
WAR WHICH IN THE PAST DECADE HAS LEFT OVER 70,000 KILLED.

   LECHEVALIER MAINTAINED THERE IS ALREADY AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL
ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS TO "OVERSEE THE FAITHFUL
COMPLIANCE OF THE AGREEMENTS ON A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE," AS ESTABLISHED
IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS KNOWN AS ESQUIPULAS II.

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 NOV 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] GENERAL JUAN
RAFAEL BUSTILLO, COMMANDER OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE, TODAY DEFENDED THE
MILITARY ACTIONS THAT THE ARMY CARRIED OUT DURING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONA LIBERATION FRONT] OFFENSIVE.  THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THERE
HAS BEEN DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST THE FMLN REBELS, IT HAS ONLY BEEN TO DEFEND
THE CIVILIANS FROM WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A FOREIGN AGGRESSION.  IN THIS WAY,
GEN BUSTILLO REPLIED TO STATEMENTS BY SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA
Y DAMAS, WHO SAID THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IN SAN SALVADOR
WAS EXCESSIVE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] MANY COMMENTS CAN BE MADE BUT WHAT MUST BE
ASKED IS WHY DID THE REBELS SEEK THE URBAN AREAS?  WHAT IS THEIR
JUSTIFICATION?  THAT IS THE CONDEMNABLE ASPECT.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND
THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER WE ACTED STRONGLY AS MSGR
RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID.  IT IS TRUE WE HAVE BEEN STRONG AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE STRONG.  BUT WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE TERRORISTS BEGAN THE ACTION,
THAT IS HOW THE PROBLEM BEGAN.  THAT IS WHAT MUST BE JUDGED AND NOT HOW WE
REACTED. [END RECORDING]

   GEN BUSTILLO SAID THE MAIN ROLE OF THE AIR FORCE IS THE DEFENSE OF
THE FATHERLAND.  HE ADDED: THERE IS NO ROOM HERE FOR GUERRILLAS AND
MUCH LESS FOR THOSE OF THE FMLN WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEFENDERS OF THE
PEOPLE.  GEN BUSTILLO SAID THIS FMLN OFFENSIVE WAS NOT PREPARED IN THE
LAST FEW DAYS.  INSTEAD, HE SAID, IT MUST HAVE BEEN PREPARED AT LEAST
18 MONTHS AGO.  HE SAID IT HAS TAKEN TIME TO OUST THE REBELS BECAUSE
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT WANTED TO HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,
AMONG WHICH THE INSURGENTS HID.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THESE
TERRORISTS WHEN THEY TAKE PEOPLE AS HOSTAGES. THAT IS WHY FOR YEARS THEY
BEGAN INFILTRATING AND ESTABLISHING THE MEANS TO USE THE PEOPLE AS A COVER.
WE CAN SEE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VILLAGES
FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, THEY HAVE NOW CARRIED OUT HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND
OTHER BIG CITIES.  THEY HAVE TAKEN COVER BEHIND THE PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHY
IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANNIHILATE THEM.  WE HAD TO BE
CAREFUL SO AS TO CAUSE THE LEAST HARM TO THE PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   HE ALSO SAID THE SEIZURE OF THE SHERATON HOTEL IS AN ISOLATED
INCIDENT THAT ONLY SEEKS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  BUSTILLO SAID A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAS JUST BEEN A GAME FOR THE REBELS SO NO ONE IN
EL SALVADOR SHOULD CONSIDER IT AS A SOLUTION TO A 10-YEAR-OLD WAR THAT
HAS LEFT MORE THAN 60,000 DEAD.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] THE DIALOGUE AND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAVE
BEEN A TACTIC USED BY THE FMLN FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  WE CAN NOW CLEARLY SEE
THAT NEITHER THE PEOPLE, ARMED FORCES, NOR THE POLITICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER
THEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE.  IT CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN THAT ALL THIS TIME DURING
WHICH SOME INDIVIDUALS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN SEEKING A SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE, THE FMLN HAD
JUST BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS OFFENSIVE. [END RECORDING]

   ASKED WHAT PLANS THE ARMED FORCES HAVE IN THE FACE OF ANOTHER FMLN
OFFENSIVE, THE GENERAL WAS EMPHATIC:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSTILLO] ANNIHILATE THEM.  ANNIHILATE THEM.  THAT IS
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO. [END RECORDING]

   THE GENERAL MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO THIS NEWSCAST AFTER HE LISTED
THE WEAPONS THAT WERE SEIZED AND THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED BY THE ARMY.
BUSTILLO SAID FOUR OFFICERS OF THE PARATROOPERS BATTALION WERE KILLED
AND SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED.  HE SAID 20 SOLDIERS DIED IN THE MILITARY
ACTIONS [TIME FRAME NOT SPECIFIED].

   BOGOTA, 23 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] GENERAL MIGUEL ANTONIO GOMEZ
PADILLA, NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR, REPORTED TODAY THAT PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA, NUMBER ONE IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, AND ONE OF THE OCHOA
BROTHERS, ALSO A KINGPIN IN THE GROUP, ARE APPARENTLEY SURROUNDED AND
SHOULD BE CAPTURED ANY TIME.

   GENERAL PADILLA TOLD REPORTERS AT 1500 GMT TODAY THAT THE SEARCH
FOR SOME OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL LEADERS HAD BEEN INTENSIFIED IN THE
PAST 2 DAYS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN
CENTER. HE REFUSED TO IDENTIFY THE PLACE SO AS NOT TO HAMPER THE
OPERATIONS.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE POLICE'S
ELITE GROUP, SUPPORTED BY ARMY AND AIR FORCE TROOPS.

   GEN PADILLA SAID: "FOR THE PAST 2 DAYS, SPECIAL ELITE POLICE
MEMBERS, SUPPORTED BY THE AIR FORCE AND MILITARY UNITS, HAVE
CONFRONTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE SEARCH FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPOS
WHO WILL BE CAPTURED LATER."

   "AT THIS TIME, WE ARE OPERATING IN A SPECIFIC AREA AGAINST THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL."  HE ALSO SAID THAT "PABLO ESCOBAR AND ONE OF THE
OCHOA BROTHERS" ARE POSSIBLY ENCIRCLED AND THAT THE CLASHES
"APPARENTLY HAVE RESULTED IN TWO MEN BEING KILLED AND NUMEROUS OTHERS
BEING DETAINED."

   THE HIGH-RANKING OFFICER ASKED NEWSMEN FOR TIME "TO COMPLETE THE
ACTION AND, POSSIBLY, TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED VICTORY."

   POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE
CONCORNA MUNICIPALITY AREA, IN ANTIOQUIA'S MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION,
BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, SOME 180 KM NORTHWEST OF THE COLOMBIAN
CAPITAL, WHERE GUERRILLAS OF THE CAMILIST UNION - NATIONAL LIBERATION
ARMY (UC-ELN) ARE ALSO ACTIVE.

   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS REGARDED AS THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT DRUG
TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION AND, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. POLICE, IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE SMUGGLED INTO THE UNITED
STATES.

   PABLO ESCOBAR AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUEZ, THE CARTEL'S NUMBER ONE
AND NUMBER TWO MEN, RESPECTIVELY, ARE RANKED AMONG THE WORLD'S 20
RICHEST MEN BY SPECIALIZED U.S. MAGAZINES LIKE "FORBES" AND "FORTUNE,"
WHICH ESTIMATE THEIR PERSONAL WEALTH AT OVER $3 BILLION.

   JORGE LUIS OCHOA HAS TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE ALSO REGARDED AS
IMPORTANT DRUG KINGPINS.

THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, HAS ESCAPED FROM THE COLOMBIAN POLICE TRAP WHICH
WAS SET UP 2 DAYS AGO TO CAPTURE HIM, POLICE SOURCES SAID.

   ESCOBAR, REGARDED AS THE OPERATIONS CHIEF OF COLOMBIA'S LARGEST
COCAINE - EXPORTING GROUP, FLED "VIRTUALLY IN UNDERWEAR," ONE OF THE
OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATIONS SAID.

   CHIEF OF POLICE GENERAL MIGUEL PADILLA HAD EARLIER REPORTED THAT
THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAD BEEN "SURROUNDED" AND THAT "HIS CAPTURE WAS
IMMINENT." PADILLA ALSO SAID HE WAS "ALMOST SURE" THAT THE OPERATION,
IN WHICH THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE ALSO PARTICIPATED, WOULD YIELD
"POSITIVE RESULTS."

   THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES SURROUNDED AND RAIDED FOUR ESTATES OWNED
BY ESCOBAR GAVIRIA IN THE MIDDLE REGION OF THE MAGDALENA RIVER, IN
COLOMBIA'S NORTHERN CENTER.

   ON THE ESTATES, CALLED "LAS PALMAS," "EL ORO," "LA PAZ," AND
"FLORENCIA," 50 BODYGUARDS AND 5 WOMEN WERE DETAINED.  TWO
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ENSUING CLASHES.

   THE POLICE SEIZED RIFLES, ISRAELI-MADE UZZI SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND
SEVERAL GRENADES.

   ACCORDING TO A POLICE SOURCE, THE POLICE ELITE TROOPS HAVE
CONTINUED TO COMB THE AREAS NEAR THE RAIDED ESTATES IN AN EFFORT TO
TRACK THE ESCAPEES, WHO COULD INCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE OCHOA BROTHERS,
WHO ARE THE CARTEL'S HEADS.

   THE OPERATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN THE COCORNA MUNICIPALITY, IN
THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA IN ANTIOQUIA, BETWEEN MEDELLIN AND BOGOTA, 180 KM
NORTHWEST FROM BOGOTA.

   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS CONSIDERED RESPONSIBLE FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE
COCAINE THAT ENTERS THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 23 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE REBELS ON 22
NOVEMBER FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER THE UNITED
NATIONS SUPERVISION THIS AFTERNOON.

   (THE REBEL PROPOSAL) "IS HARDLY SERIOUS.  WE DO NOT FEEL THIS
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT SERIOUS.
AGAIN (THE GUERRILLAS) ASSERT THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMIES. THERE IS JUST
ONE ARMY IN EL SALVADOR," THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID.

   CRISTIANI'S STATMENTS WERE MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED BY AN INTENSIVE
AIR RAID BY SIX SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES WHICH ARE BOMBING
GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE SLOPES OF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO.

   COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
GENERAL STAFF, WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING CRISTIANI, ASSERTED THAT THE ARMY
IS CHASING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF "GUERRILLAS WHO ARE FLEEING IN
GREAT CONFUSION."  


DEV-MUC3-0857 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] JUST AS WE REPORTED
THIS AFTERNOON, FASCIST CRISTIANI AND PONCE, THE VISIBLE HEAD OF LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] HELD A PECULIAR NEWS CONFERENCE WHICH NOT EVEN THE
CUSCATLAN RADIO NETWORK EVEN DARED BROADCAST.

    THE NEWS CONFERENCE HAD JUST BEGUN THIS AFTERNOON WITH CRISTIANI
AND SOME REPORTERS.  PONCE WAS BESIDE HIM.  SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION
OCCURRED WHICH STARTLED BOTH CRISTIANI AND PONCE.  THE NERVOUSNESS OF
CRISTIANI AND PONCE DID NOT FADE AWAY.  THEY WERE SCARED.  THE
REPORTERS ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  AFTER STAMMERING
FOR A WHILE, PONCE SAID IT WAS A BOMBING BY THE ARMY ON THE SLOPES OF
THE [SAN] SALVADOR VOLCANO.

   IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] POSITION, WHICH HE DESCRIBED
AS A PROPOSAL.  BUT THE FMLN HAS MADE NO PROPOSAL.  THE FMLN HAS BUT
ECHOED THE CLAMOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND VARIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS, ALL OF WHICH DEMAND A CEASE - FIRE IN THE COUNTRY.
CONSEQUENTLY, CRISTIANI HAS NOT REJECTED A CEASE - FIRE PROPOSAL, BUT
THE POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  


DEV-MUC3-0858 (GTE)

   TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAS TODAY
DEMANDED FROM NICARAGUA THE "IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL" OF SANDINIST TROOPS
CONCENTRATED ALONG COMMON BORDER AREAS AND WARNED OF ITS INTENTION TO
"REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAS' TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
INTEGRITY."

   HONDURAS, IN A NOTE SENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS
TO HIS COLLEAGUE MIGUEL D'ESCOTO, STATED ITS "CONCERN DUE TO THE
ANNOUNCEMENTS NICARAGUAN SPOKESMEN ARE MAKING ON TAKING MILITARY
ACTION AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, WHEREVER THEY MAY BE."

   IN THE HONDURAN DEPARMENT OF EL PARAISO, ON THE NICARAGUAN BORDER,
THERE ARE SOME 12,000 ARMED ANTI-SANDINISTS, BASED THERE SINCE 1982,
WHO RESIST DEMOBILIZATION AND ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN
NICARAGUA.

   TO THIS EFFECT, LOPEZ CONTRERAS POINTED OUT THAT "THE BORDER AREA
THREATENED BY SANDINIST ARMY AND ARTILLERY, HOLDS SOME 15,000
HONDURANS, ALSO CAMPS OF UNARMED FORMER NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
FIGHTERS, MANY WHOM ARE CRIPPLED, WITH THEIR FAMILIES."

   THE HONDURAN PROTEST NOTE SAYS THAT "TO INDISCRIMINATELY BOMB THE
HONDURAN CIVILIAN POPULATION WOULD BE A BARBARIC ACT, AND IF IT WERE
CARRIED OUT INVOKING A SO-CALLED RIGHT TO MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST
THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION, IT WOULD BE A CONSCIOUS MASSACRE."

   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY WARNED THAT "THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
RESIGN ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY ACTION THAT VIOLATES OUR COUNTRY'S
SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL INTEGRITY."

   NEVERTHELESS, THE OFFICER CLARIFIED THAT THE HONDURAN ARMY HAS NOT
MOVED ADDITIONAL TROOPS INTO THAT BORDER AREA.

   LOPEZ CONTRERAS INSISTED THAT THE "CONTRAS," WHO ARE AT CAMPS NEAR
NICARAGUA, ARE "MOSTLY CIVILIANS AND UNARMED FORMER FIGHTERS."

   THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S STATEMENT CONTRASTED WITH THE FACT
THAT THE "CONTRAS" THEMSELVES HAVE REITERATED THEIR REFUSAL TO TURN IN
THEIR WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND
VERIFICATION (CIAV).

   THE CIAV, MADE UP BY OAS AND UN DELEGATES, WAS CREATED IN SEPTEMBER
TO DIRECT THE "CONTRAS'" DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, OR RESETTLEMENT
PROCESS, AGREED IN AUGUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   THE PRESIDENTS SET THE DEMOBILIZATION DATE FOR 5 DECEMBER.

   THE TALKS ON THIS TOPIC, HELD IN WASHINGTON BETWEEN THE "CONTRAS"
AND THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT, SPONSORD BY THE CIAV, AND IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE HONDURAN DELEGATES, WERE SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY ON
WEDNESDAY.

   FORESEEING "POSSIBLE INCIDENTS," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID
IT HAS INFORMED OF THE OAS AND UN SECRETARIES GENERAL.


DEV-MUC3-0859 (GTE)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [REPORT] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] CRISTIANI
EMPHASIZED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CAPABLE OF COUNTERING ANY
AGGRESSION ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE ALSO TERMED AS A COMPLETE
FAILURE THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS SPURNED BY THE CITIZENRY,
ADDING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE
FMLN'S TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [CRISTIANI] "LET US SAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARED TO MILITARILY COUNTER THE AGGRESSION FOR AS
LONG AS THE FMLN WANTS TO.  THE FMLN DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE
BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED IT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE PEOPLE HAVE SPURNED IT ONCE AGAIN.  THE ONLY THING THE
FMLN HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IS TO EARN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SCORN."

   "WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE BUT
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENDING OF HOSTILITIES SHOULD BE THE FIRST GESTURE
BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TALK TO THE FMLN.  IF THIS DOES
NOT OCCUR, I DO NOT THINK THAT ONE SINGLE SALVADORAN WILL TRUST THE
FMLN IN THE LEAST [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE, MEANING THE ARMED FORCES
AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, DO NOT WANT TO [WORDS
INDISTINCT]."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CURFEW WILL
BE MODIFIED, PARTICULARLY IN PLACES WHERE ORDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
RESTORED.  HE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER SOUGHT A
MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT BECAUSE THAT IS CLARIFIED IN
THE CONSTITUTION.

    CRISTIANI "WE HAVE NEVER SOUGHT A MILITARY SOLUTION.  THE FMLN IS
THE ONE WHICH HAS OPTED FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION.  WE HAVE NOT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WEAPONS AND WE HAVE NOT
SOUGHT THE ARMED FORCES TO DO IT.  THE FMLN IS THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO
SEIZE POWER WITH ITS WEAPONS.  THE ARMED FORCES HAS ONLY FULFILLED ITS
DUTY, WHICH IS TO COUNTER AN ARMED ACTION."

   "FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AGGRESSION IS [WORDS INDISTINCT]
NICARAGUA AND CUBA, BECAUSE NICARAGUA AND CUBA [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
FMLN WOULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS BUT IT MUST BE FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE REBEL GROUPS
ARE WILLING TO PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
IN A PEACEFUL AND VOLUNTARY WAY.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
ROLE IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WAS LIMITED TO NOTIFYING HIS COUNTERPART,
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION AND REASSERTING
THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION GIVEN THE FMLN DELEGATION'S ABSENCE -- WHICH
CONFIRMED THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  


DEV-MUC3-0860 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
WHENEVER WE HAVE MADE ANY PEACE PROPOSAL, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
ANSWERS BY SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND THAT OUR
PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT IS WHAT ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ALWAYS SAYS.
WELL, WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK [U.S.  AMBASSADOR] WILLIAM WALKER -- WHO
HAS SAID IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] PEACE PROPOSALS ARE NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY
VIOLATE THE SALVADORAN CONSTITUTION -- IF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT
PROHIBIT FOREIGN TROOPS FROM COMING TO OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT THE
GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL?  WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WHY U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES CAME TO EL
SALVADOR, AS PRESIDENT BUSH HIMSELF ANNOUNCED?  WE SAW THESE SPECIAL
FORCES IN THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR, VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION THAT
YOU PEOPLE CLAIM TO DEFEND.

   WE WANT TO ASK THE PATRIOTIC OFFICIALS: WHY ARE THERE THREE ARMIES
RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY?  THERE IS THE FMLN ARMY, THE LA TANDONA
[REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY] ARMY, AND PRESIDENT BUSH'S ARMY.  SO, WHAT
IS THE ANSWER?  WHENEVER WE PROPOSE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT, WE ARE TOLD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE
CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BUSH VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION THAT
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CLAIM TO DEFEND WHEN HE
SENT A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE TO THIS COUNTRY.  HE ALSO VIOLATED THE
SOVEREIGNTY OF THIS NATION.  THEREFORE, GENTLEMEN OF ARENA AND OF THE
HIGH COMMAND, THIS LOVE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS THAT YOU
CLAIM TO HAVE IS FALSE.

   WE WANT TO ASK COLONEL PONCE: WHY IS THERE A FOREIGN MILITARY FORCE
IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW?  DOESN'T THE CONSTITUTION THAT YOUR ARMED
FORCES CLAIM TO RESPECT PROHIBIT IT?  IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN THE NATION
WANTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE, YOU PEOPLE SAY IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE MUST RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, WHEN
PRESIDENT BUSH ARROGANTLY ANNOUNCES IN HIS PRESIDENTIAL PLANE THAT HIS
FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT OPERATIONS IN A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, THEN THE
CONSTITUTION IS WORTH NOTHING.

   WE WANT TO APPEAL TO THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS TO THINK ABOUT THIS
SITUATION.  THERE ARE OFFICERS BEING KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELDS.  FOR
EXAMPLE, AN OFFICER FROM THE MORAZAN BATTALION DIED IN ALTOS DE LA
CUEVA IN SAN MIGUEL; LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR
CITY; DOZENS OF LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED OR KILLED IN THE LAST 10
DAYS.  OFFICERS, YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS.  SO WE WANT TO CALL ON THE
LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPTAINS, THE PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, TO THINK ABOUT THIS
SITUATION.  YOU ARE BEING TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION.
WHAT CONSTITUTION?  AFTER ALL, A HERD OF GRINGO RAMBOS IS HERE; AND
WITH THEIR YANKEE BOOTS, THEY HAVE TRAMPLED ON THE CONSTITUTION.  SO
OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU DEFENDING?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?  THIS
SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY SALVADORAN PATRIOT.  OFFICERS, WE
KNOW YOU ARE LISTENING TO US IN THE GARRISONS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS HIDING THIS INFORMATION
FROM YOU.  YOU MUST THINK OVER THIS SITUATION, OFFICERS.  YOU ARE
SHEDDING BLOOD, LOSING ARMS AND LEGS IN THE BATTLEFIELDS, SACRIFICING
YOUR LIVES, SEEING HOW THE CAPITAL CITY IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE
BOMBINGS, AND YOU ARE TOLD THIS IS BEING DONE TO DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, MR BUSH DECIDED TO SEND A HERD OF RAMBOS WHO
ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING.  AFTER ALL, THEY DID NOTHING, EXCEPT COVER THEIR
FACES LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS.  SO, OFFICERS, WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR?
WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE?  IS IT COMMUNISM, OR THIS OR THAT?  IS IT
BECAUSE MSGR ROMERO WAS A COMMUNIST AND THEREFORE MURDERED?  WAS IT
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE COMMUNISTS AND THEREFORE MURDERED?  NOW IT IS
SAID THAT THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBERS ARE COMMUNISTS.
OTHERS SAY THAT THE JOURNALISTS, THE TEACHERS ARE COMMUNISTS; EVERYONE
IS A COMMUNIST.  IS THIS A NATION OF COMMUNISTS?  WHAT IS THIS?  WE
MUST START TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION AT THIS CRITICAL HOUR FOR THE
NATION.  [CONTINUED]

TEXT OF THE NOTE READS.

   NOTE NO. 122-DSM

   TEGUCIGALPA, 23 NOVEMBER 1989

   HIS EXCELLENCY

   MR MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMANN

   FOREIGN MINISTER

   MANAGUA, NICARAGUA

   MR MINISTER:

   MY GOVERNMENT HAS NOTED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE CONCENTRATION OF
NICARAGUAN TROOPS AT VARIOUS POINTS OF THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS, AS
WELL AS THE ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN
ABOUT BEGINNING MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THEIR ARMED OPPOSITION,
REGARDLESS OF LOCATION.

   TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DANGER REPRESENTED BY THE
CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS AT THE BORDER, MY GOVERNMENT HEREBY WARNS THAT
IT IS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, PARTICULARLY TO INTER-AMERICAN
LAW, TO RESORT TO THREATS OR THE USE OF FORCE AND TO VIOLATE THE
SOVERIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF OTHER STATES.

   AS YOUR GOVERNMENT IS FULLY AWARE OF -- AND THIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED
BY ON-SITE INSPECTIONS BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND
VERIFICATION (CIAV) -- APPROXIMATELY 15,000 HONDURANS LIVE IN THE
BORDER SECTOR CURRENTLY THREATENED BY THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY AND
ARTILLERY.  THE SECURITY OF THOSE CITIZENS IS THE PRIMARY
RESPONSIBILITY OF MY GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IN THAT SECTOR THERE ARE
CAMPS OF DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS FROM THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
[RN].  MANY OF THEM ARE WAR CRIPPLED AND THEIR RELATIVES, MOST OF WHOM
ARE CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY.

   TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE HONDURAN CIVILIAN
POPULATION AND TO VIOLATE THAT SECTOR OF HONDURAN TERRITORY WOULD BE A
BARBARIC ACTION AGAINST HUMANITY.  IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO AN ALLEGED
RIGHT TO CARY OUT MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST YOUR ARMED OPPOSITION "NO
MATTER WHERE THEY ARE," I REMIND YOU THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL
MASSACRE, BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE CIVILIANS AND
THE REST ARE DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS.  THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN
VERIFIED BY THE CIAV.

   THEREFORE, MY GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE
NICARAGUAN TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE BORDER AREAS WITH HONDURAS.  UP
UNTIL THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER
OF TROOPS WHO REGULARLY COMPOSE THE BORDER SECURITY FORCES.

   NEVERTHELESS, MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY
ACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY
AND TO CARRY OUT THE CONSULTATIONS IT DEEMS NECESSARY, TO ADOPT THE
INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE DEFENSE MEASURES THE SITUATION REQUIRES.

   MY GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS TO STATE THAT IT VIEWS WITH ASTONISHMENT
THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO THE
COUNTERREVOLUTION -- DURING THE TALKS PROMOTED BY THE CIAV IN THE
UNITED STATES -- IN THE SENSE THAT THE NICARAGUAN INTERNAL ARMED
CONFLICT BE SOLVED BY WITHDRAWING THE ARMED OPPOSITION TO HONDURAS.
THIS PROPOSAL CLEARLY VIOLATES THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND THE
AGREEMENTS SIGNED AT THE TELA SUMMIT, WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR
DEMOCRATIZATION, NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOBILIZATION, AND
REPATRIATION.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO, INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS IN EL

THOSE MADE BY LUCIA BARRERA CERNA, ONE OF THE MAIN WITNESSES, "ARE NOT
CONCLUSIVE, NOR HAVE THEY SHED ANY LIGHT" ON THE IDENTITY OF THE
KILLERS."

   THE JESUITS, FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN, WERE MURDERED 9
DAYS AGO BY A GROUP OF MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS DURING A "CURFEW"
DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE THAT
BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   LUCIA BARRERA, WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE COLORADO, A GOVERNMENT
COMMISSION INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS, AND SEVERAL DIPLOMATS, AMONG
THEM SPANISH AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ, SAID THAT THE MURDERERS
NUMBERED BETWEEN 30 AND 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.
COLORADO SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT "THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES,
NONE OF WHICH HAS SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE CASE.  THEIR DECLARATIONS ARE
NOT CONCLUSIVE REGARDING THIS SAD AND REGRETTABLE EVENT."  HE STRESSED
"THAT IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY DID IT."

   ACCORDING TO COLORADO, NEITHER FBI AGENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES,
NOR SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN, NOR THE SPANISH
GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATES -- AS REQUESTED BY SALVDORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI WHEN HE PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXHAUSTIVELY --
HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR.

   HE SAID THAT THE COURT WILL SUBPOENA MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ,
DIRECTOR OF THE SAN SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, "TO
DECLARE WHAT SHE KNOWS, WHO TOLD HER WHAT, AND TO SAY IF SHE WAS AT
THE SCENE."

   THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION,
HAS PROMISED TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION JOINTLY WITH THE JESUITS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL CLUES,"
WHEN ASKED BY REPORTERS IF HE WOULD INTERROGATE THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE
PATROLLING THE UNIVERSITY AREA WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE ON 16
NOVEMBER.

   MEANWHILE, JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA, JESUIT SUPERIOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
SAID THAT THE MAIN WITNESS TO THE MURDERS IS "SAFE AND SOUND" ABROAD,
POSSIBLY IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ACCORDING TO TOJEIRA, THE WITNESS, WHO WAS INTERROGATED REPEATEDLY,
WAS KEPT UNDER STRICT SECURITY. HE STRESSED THAT SHE LEFT FOR AN
UNKNOWN DESTINATION AND THAT SHE "IS AT EASE BECAUSE SHE HAS TOLD THE
TRUTH."

   JESUIT SUPERIOR TOJEIRA AND ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF
SAN SALVADOR, HAVE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS WERE EITHER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OR
PERSONS CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM.

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS BELIEF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPLIED, "I DO
NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE
ARMY DID IT."

   SEOUL (ROK), 22 NOV 89 (HANGYORE SINMUN) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] AT A
TIME WHEN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION IS RIVETED ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION
MOVEMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE HEAR A GLOOMY NEWS REPORT THAT THE
PROTRACTED CIVIL WAR BETWEEN EL SALVADOR'S GOVERNMENTAL TROOPS
RECEIVING U.S. ASSISTANCE AND LEFTIST GUERRILLAS HAS RECENTLY ONCE
AGAIN INTENSIFIED, AND HAS TAKEN MANY LIVES.

   THE SOVIET UNION IS NOW PRODDING THE COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE,
WHICH WERE ONCE KNOWN AS SOVIET SATELLITES, TO DEMOCRATIZE AND TO
REFORM THEIR STATE SYSTEMS; WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES INCREASE ITS
MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR AND CAUSE THE CIVIL WAR TO INTENSIFY?

   LIKE MANY CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY BECAME
DEMOCRATIZED, THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS
SUCH THAT IT IS PLAGUED BY AN EXTREME FORM OF THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND
POOR, BY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, BY RIGHT-WING TERRORISM, AND BY ABUSE
OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD BE ENGULFED BY REVOLUTION
AT ANY TIME.  HOW CAN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION OUT OF A
POPULATION OF 5.4 MILLION ARE ON THE BORDER OF STARVATION, AND WHERE
ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ENJOYS 66 PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, BE IN PEACE?

   AFTER A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT UPRISING IN 1930, THE LEFTIST FORCES IN
THIS COUNTRY FORMED A UNIFIED GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION IN 1980 AND BEGAN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EARNEST.

   THE OLIGARCHIC RULING CLASS, WHICH IS SAID TO CONSIST OF 15 TO 240
FAMILIES WITH HIGH INCOME, LAUNCHED A "CLEAN-UP OPERATION" AGAINST
GUERRILLAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE MILITARY, AND OPENLY MASSACRED THE
LEADERS OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS BY ORGANIZING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING
ASSASSINATION GROUP CALLED THE "DEATH SQUAD."  THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR
AS TO ASSASSINATE INTELLECTUALS AND CLERGYMEN WHO CHAMPIONED SOCIAL
REFORM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   FILMS SUCH AS "ROMERO" AND "SALVADOR" THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN OUR
COUNTRY IN RECENT MONTHS ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE BRUTALITY COMMITTED
BY SUCH AN ASSASSINATION GROUP.  THIS GROUP WAS UNQUESTIONABLY BEHIND
THE RECENT ASSASSINATIONS IN WHICH 10 LABOR UNION LEADERS WERE
MERCILESSLY MASSACRED AND ANOTHER 8, INCLUDING A JESUIT PRIEST, WERE
BRUTALLY KILLED.

   THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNITED STATES LURKS BEHIND THE MILITARY AND
RIGHT-WING FORCES THAT ARE BENT ON SUPPRESSING THOSE WHO CALL FOR
SOCIAL REFORM AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT STOPPING AT A "CLEANING
UP" OF THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS.  WHILE SENDING A GROUP OF MILITARY
ADVISERS TO EL SALVADOR TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS MOP UP THE
GUERRILLAS, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ALSO SUPPLYING THE COUNTRY WITH
WEAPONS, INCLUDING ASSAULT HELICOPTERS, WORTH U.S. $103 MILLION.

   HOW LONG WILL THE UNITED STATES RETAIN ITS OLD POLICY OF IGNORING
SOCIAL REFORM AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND OF
GIVING MILITARY AID TO ITS INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DEFEND
ITS OWN INTERESTS?  WITH OUR EYES ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION MOVEMENT IN
EAST EUROPE, WE ARE COMPELLED TO THINK ONCE AGAIN OF THE
DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND OF THE OUTSIDE
INTERVENTION THERE BLOCKING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   DRAWING A LESSON FROM THE DEFEAT IT SUFFERED IN VIETNAM AND IN
IRAN, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CEASE INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL
AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FOREIGNERS LINKED TO
TERRORISTS WILL BE DEPORTED.  IMMIGRATION GENERAL DIRECTOR COLONEL
MAXIMILIANO LEIVA HAS SAID THAT FOREIGNERS ARRESTED FOR THEIR TIES TO FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN
TURNED OVER TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CONSULAR REPRESENTATIVES.  HE REPORTED THE
ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE TREASURY POLICE AND OTHER SECURITY ELEMENTS WHO ARE
COURAGEOUSLY FIGHTING THE FMLN MURDEROUS COMMUNISTS, WHO WANT TO INSTALL A
MARXIST - LENINIST GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THESE REBELS WILL NOT HAVE THEIR
WAY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DEPORTED TO THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN.

   COL LEIVA ALSO NOTED THAT 1,100 SALVADORAN REFUGEES RETURNED
RECENTLY FROM COLOMONCAGUA, HONDURAS, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH LEGAL
IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES.  ARRIVING WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE CHILDREN
-- RAGING IN AGE FROM 12 TO 13, SOME LESS THAN 7.  COL LEIVA STATED
THE REFUGEES BROUGHT IN MEDICAL SUPPLIES, AND THEIR PLAN IS TO HELP
THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS IN THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 NOV 89 (DIARIO LATINO) -- [TEXT] "THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] USED TUPAC AMARU, VIETNAMESE, SANDINIST,
AND OTHER GUERRILLA WARFARE OFFENSIVE TACTICS IN ITS OFFENSIVE," [COLONEL
RENE EMILIO] PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES, STATED 23 NOVEMBER. HE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE
RESULTED IN 1,484 GUERRILLAS AND 284 SOLDIERS KILLED.  THE OFFICER SAID THAT
GUERRILLAS WERE ENGAGED IN A TACTICAL-TYPE DIALOGUE BY ATTENDING THE
MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHILE PREPARING FOR THE OFFENSIVE.  AMONG THE
WEAPONS SEIZED, WE FOUND RUSTED WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, INDICATING THEY HAD
BEEN BURIED FOR A LONG TIME.  WE ALSO FOUND DOCUMENTS AND MEDICINES WITH
OLDT EXPIRATION DATES."

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES LEARNED ON 9 NOVEMBER ABOUT THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN ON 11 NOVEMBER, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO
ACT. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES ACTED WITH CAUTION WHEN IT BEGAN,
BECAUSE THE FMLN WANTED A FAR-REACHING REACTION, SOMETHING WHICH WOULD
HAVE ENTAILED HUGE DAMAGE TO CIVILIANS, AND SO THE GUERRILLAS'
INTENTIONS FAILED.

   THE TUPAC AMARU TACTIC EMPLOYED CONSISTED IN DIGGING LARGE DITCHES,
AND SO THE GUERRILLAS FORCED THE PEOPLE TO DIG THEM, COL PONCE SAID.

   REGARDING THE BOMBINGS HEARD EAST OF THE CAPITAL DURING THE NEWS
CONFERENCE, COL PONCE SAID IT WAS A OPERATION TO PURSUE "A GROUP OF
TERRORISTS WHO HAD BEEN LOCATED IN THE LOS CASTILLOS, SAN FRANCISCO,
AND EL PROGRESO CANTONS.  HOWEVER, ONLY THE FIRST CANTON WAS SHELLED
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN EVACUATED, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE OTHER TWO
CANTONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES TODAY REPORTED THAT A PLANE LOADED WITH WEAPONS FOR GUERRILLAS
COMING FROM NICARAGUA CRASHED AT DAWN TODAY IN A TOWN OF USULUTAN
DEPARMENT, KILLING THREE CREWMEN WHILE A FOURTH COMMITTED "SUICIDE."

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) POINTED OUT THAT THE
PLANE CRASHED AT 0025 LOCAL TIME (0625 GMT) IN A TOWN IN EL TRANSITO,
EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO COPREFA, THREE CREWMEN DIED
DURING THE ACCIDENT AND A FOURTH SURVIVED, BUT COMMITTED SUICIDE
AFTERWARD.  THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT IDENTIFY THE CREWMEN, STATING
ONLY THAT THEY WERE WEARING CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS.

   THE MILITARY SOURCE REPORTED THAT THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE,
RED-STRIPED TWO-MOTOR "CESSNA" BELONGS TO A COMPANY CALLED "SETA"
HEADQUARTERED IN NICARAGUA.

   THE COPREFA REPORT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE FLIGHT SCHEDULE, STATES
THAT THE PLANE LEFT MANAGUA (NICARAGUA) AND WAS TO HAVE LANDED IN
AMATECAMPO, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, BUT SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT IN "PIEDRA
PACHA" NEAR EL TRANSITO.

   COPREFA REPORTS THAT THE PLANE WAS CARRYING 24 "SAM-7"
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, A "REDEYE" MISSILE, A 75- MM ANTITANK GUN,
AND 21 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FOR NONRECOILLESS 75- MM CANNON.

   SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS SURROUNDED THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT AND
SEIZED THE WEAPONS, THE SOURCE REPORTED.

   ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES
HAVE ACCUSED THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT OF HELPING THE FARABUNNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) LOGISTICALLY AND WITH WEAPONS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN BEGAN ON
11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS YIELDED 2,000 DEAD AND THOUSANDS OF WOUNDED,
WAS SUPPORTED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, WHICH SUPPLIED MOST OF THE
WEAPONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [BULLETIN]
[ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE] [TEXT] A CESSNA PLANE TRANSPORTING
WEAPONS FROM MANAGUA CRASHED TODAY AT 0525 ON A SMALL LANDING STRIP IN
PIEDRA PACHA CANTON, EL TRANSITO, 6 KM EAST OF USULUTAN.  THE PLANE
WAS CARRYING THE FOLLOWING WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT TERRORISTS: 24 SAM-7, SOVIET-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR
MISSILES; 21 GRENADES FOR 75-MM CANNONS; A 75-MM ANTI-TANK CANNON; A
U.S.-MADE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE KNOWN AS THE RED-EYE; AND OTHER
EQUIPMENT.

   THE PLANE, A WHITE AND BLUE TWIN-ENGINE CRAFT WITH RED STRIPES, WAS
BEING FLOWN BY SANDINISTS.  FOUR PERSONS, DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE WEAR,
WERE KILLED AT THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT.  SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ARE
BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WERE ALSO FOUND AT THE SCENE.
AMONG THE DOCUMENTS IS THE FLIGHT PLAN THAT SHOWS THAT THE PLANE
DEPARTED FROM MANAGUA, NICARAGUA, AND ITS DESTINATION WAS EL SALVADOR.
THIS PLANE WAS TO HAVE LANDED AT THE AMATICAMPO LANDING STRIP, ALONG
THE LA PAZ DEPARTMENT COASTLINE.

   THE INFORMATION ADDS THAT THE PLANE BELONGED TO ZETA COMPANY --
OFFICES LOCATED ACROSS FROM THE CESAR AUGUSTO SANDINO AIRPORT IN
MANAGUA -- AND THAT IT DEPARTED EARLY THIS MORNING FROM MANAGUA.  THE
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING MORE DETAILS REGARDING THIS INCIDENT,
WHICH PROVES NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE IN EL SALVADOR'S DOMESTIC
AFFAIRS.

   CLANDESTINE, 26 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] IN VIEW OF
THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT AND THE ARMED
FORCES' ATTITUDE, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THAT THE GOVERNMENT, FAR FROM SUSPENDING, HAS INTENSIFIED
BOMBINGS AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS.  IT IS NOW EVEN USING 105-MM OBUS
HOWITZERS IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS.  WE ARE INFORMING THE NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT SUCH BOMBINGS HAVE YIELDED THOUSANDS
OF REFUGEES AND DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES BELONGING TO HUMBLE
FAMILIES IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA.  IN
REJECTING A CEASE-FIRE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   2.  THAT IN VIEW OF THE RUMORS THAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO ATTACK
U.S. CITIZENS [7-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] TO NOT ATTACK U.S.
PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS.  THAT POLICY WAS EVIDENT DURING THE
SHERATON HOTEL INCIDENT IN WHICH, ALTHOUGH OUR FORCES ENJOYED AN
ADVANTAGE OVER THE GREEN BERETS TRAPPED IN THAT HOTEL, AND DESPITE THE
PREVAILING TENSION, THEY RIGOROUSLY ADHERED TO THAT POLICY WITH
DISCIPLINE.

   3.  THE FMLN DOES NOT ADVOCATE CAPTURING PRISONERS OR CARRYING OUT
INDISCRIMINATE ARMED ACTIONS.

   4.  WE ALSO ALERT THE ENTIRE NATION AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
ABOUT THE GENERALIZED REPRESSION BEING UNLEASHED BY THE ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT.  THAT PARTY, BY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND THE MARTIAL LAW, HAS HASTILY
APPROVED THE ANTITERRORIST LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE
TERROR.  THIS LAW SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT
OUR PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED, ALL FORMS OF OPPOSITION, AND TO CONSOLIDATE
A FASCIST REGIME.  THIS HAS BEEN THE HISTORIC PROJECT OF ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON AND LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF
THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] WHO NOW CONTROLS THE
ENTIRE MILITARY LEADERSHIP.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THIS AIRCRAFT, I REPEAT, WAS
CARRYING VERY SOPHISTICATED ARMAMENTS.  IT CARRIED 24 SOVIET-MADE
SURFACE-TO-AIR-MISSILES, ONE 75-MM RECOILLESS CANNON, GRENADES FOR
THAT CANNON, AND IT ALSO HAD DOCUMENTS AND MANUALS EXPLAINING ITS
USAGE.

   WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE DOING NOTHING IN VIEW OF THIS GENOCIDAL,
INTERVENTIONIST ACTION, AND MORE THAN ANYTHING, A TRAITOROUS ACTION BY
DANIEL ORTEGA.  THAT IS WHY WE RESOLVED ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, TO MAKE THE PROPER CHARGES AGAINST ORTEGA AND HIS GOVERNMENT
BEFORE THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE OAS SECURITY COUNCIL.

   SECOND, WE WILL SUSPEND RELATIONS, BE THEY DIPLOMATIC, COMMERCIAL,
OR OF ANY SORT WITH NICARAGUA.  WE WILL WITHDRAW OUR MISSION FROM
NICARAGUA.

   THIRD, AT THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT, EL SALVADOR WILL NOT GO TO
NICARAGUA.  RIGHT NOW, IT WILL ASK THE OTHER THREE DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENTS OF THE AREA TO TRANSFER THE SITE OF THAT MEETING TO ANOTHER
FRATERNAL CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.  WE WILL DEMAND THERE, BEFORE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT THEY TRULY HONOR THE ESQUIPULAS PACT
AND CONDEMN DANIEL ORTEGA FOR SUPPORTING THE FMLN

   WE CAN APPRECIATE, VERY FRANKLY, WHAT THE FMLN IS.  THEY ARE
NOTHING MORE THAN THE PUPPETS OF THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION.  MR CASTRO
AND MR ORTEGA ARE RESISTING ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE
IN THE SOVIET UNION AND IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES BEHIND THE IRON
CURTAIN WHICH ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEMOCRATIZE THEMSELVES AND GIVE THEIR
PEOPLE LIBERTY.  THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO SEEK TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN
IN POWER THROUGH THE RIFLE AND BY WAR.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT PERMIT OUR COUNTRY, OUR SMALL EL
SALVADOR, OR OUR NOBLE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE THE VICTIMS OF THAT
COMMUNIST AGGRESSION WHICH DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO SEEK TO
LAUNCH.

   IN THAT SENSE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN VIEW OF THIS NEW SITUATION, WE
WANT YOU TO REFLECT ON THAT ARTIFICIAL CEASE-FIRE WHICH THE FMLN
LAUNCHED A FEW DAYS AGO.  WHAT IS THE FMLN UP TO WITH THAT CEASE-FIRE?
IT MADE THAT PROPOSAL AFTER IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CITY THAT IT HAD
ATTACKED.  THE PEOPLE WERE RESUMING THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES AND
EVERYTHING WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THOSE AREAS.
WHY DID THEY CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE WHEN THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFEATED
IN THE OFFENSIVE BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAD REPUDIATED THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS?  THEY HAD NO REAL OBJECTIVE AHEAD, OTHER THAN TO
CONTINUE TO DESTROY, TO ASSASSINATE, AND TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE
TERRORIST ACTIONS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   THEREFORE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT PERMIT ITSELF TO FALL
INTO ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN.  IF THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND COSTA RICA
WITH A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AS THEY TRIED TO MAKE US BELIEVE, WE
REALIZE TODAY THAT THOSE ACTIONS WERE JUST ANOTHER FARCE.  THIS
AGGRESSION WAS NOT PLANNED IN 2 OR 3 DAYS.  THIS AGGRESSION HAD BEEN
PLANNED SEVERAL MONTHS BACK.  KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THEY HAD THE GALL TO
 ATTEND AND MAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED
PEACE.  THEREFORE, WE CANNOT, I REPEAT SALVADORAN PEOPLE, FALL INTO      
ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN.  THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEMAND TERRITORIAL
RIGHTS IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE A BAND OF TERRORISTS AND ARE         
PUPPETS OF ORTEGA AND CASTRO.  LET US SEE IF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE
SUPPORT, AS THEY ARE, WILL OWE ORTEGA AND CASTRO FAVORS.  IF THEY
SUCCEED, THEY WILL OWE LOYALTY NOT TO THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BUT TO      
COMMUNIST DICTATORS SUCH AS DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO.  THAT IS
WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLSIHED A CLEAR POSITION.

CONVINCED THAT YOU SALVADORANS ALSO WANT PEACE AND VIEW IT AS A MAJOR
GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED.  WE ALSO MUST BE COURAGEOUS AND ENDURE THE FMLN
AGGRESSION AS WE, PARTICULARLY, YOU HAVE IN THE PAST DAYS.

   WE ARE WILLING TO SOLVE THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT THROUGH A DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST LIARS AND CYNICS WHO HAVE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE'S DESIRE FOR PEACE AND OPPORTUNITIES
GIVEN TO THEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO SIMPLY GAIN GROUND AND TIME TO REARM
THEMSELVES TO ATTACK, KILL, AND DESTROY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   THIS IS WHY TODAY WE DEMAND THAT THE FMLN END ALL THEIR
HOSTILITIES.  THE VERIFICATION TEAM ONUCA [UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA] MAY COME HERE IF THEY WANT TO, TO
ENSURE THAT THE FMLN ENDS THEIR HOSTILITES AND FINDS A WAY TO
INCORPORATE ITSELF TO THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE
WILL NEVER AGAIN ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL INTO THE TRAP SET UP BY FMLN
CYNICS WHO HAVE DECEIVED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT
LOOKING AFTER YOUR INTERESTS, BUT THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM
THAT ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO ARE SENDING OUR WAY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE MUST ASK YOU TO TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT AND
ARMED FORCES.  IT MATTERS NOT WHAT DANIEL ORTEGA PLANS TO DO OR WHAT
WEAPONS HE SENDS THEM BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE READY TO REPEL
ANY ATTACK OR ANY IRRATIONAL ACTION THAT THE FMLN MIGHT LAUNCH.

   YOU MUST REST ASSURED AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE WAGING A STRUGGLE FOR
THE SAKE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM
AGGRESSIONS, WHICH REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIGIN, SHOULD NOT HINDER THE
FREEDOM OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE MUST BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE A
PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED, REPELLED,
AND REMOVED THIS AGGRESSION THROUGH A PROFESSIONALISM THAT MUST STAND
AS AN EXAMPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY.

   ALTHOUGH THE FMLN HAS HIDDEN BEHIND YOU, AS COWARDS DO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE GRADUALLY AND CAREFULLY DEALT A BLOW TO THEM WHILE
SAFEGUARDING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S INTERESTS.  THE ONLY DESTRUCTORS
HERE ARE THE FMLN FOLLOWERS; THE ONLY TERRORISTS HERE ARE FMLN
FOLLOWERS.  WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: I DO NOT WANT TO ALARM YOU.  I WANT US TO
GRADUALLY UNDERSTAND, AS EACH PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE FALLS INTO ITS
PLACE, WHAT THE FMLN REALLY IS: A PUPPET OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM
THAT IS ONLY SEEKING TO SUBJUGATE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TAKE AWAY
THEIR FREEDOMS, AND SINK THEM INTO DESTITUTION, AS ORTEGA HAS DONE TO
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

   OUR NICARAGUAN POLICY HAS AT NO TIME BEEN AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE; OUR POLICY IS ONLY AGAINST THAT ANTIDEMOCRATIC DICTATOR CALLED
ORTEGA WHO WANTS TO SPREAD DESTRUCTION AND DEATH TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO
SATISFY HIS OWN GOALS OF CONSOLIDATING A TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT IN
NICARAGUA.

   WE MUST BE ALERT TO ALL THE UPCOMING INFORMATION REGARDING THE
NORMALIZATION OF THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY AND REST ASSURED THAT
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HELP THE PEOPLE, WHO HAVE IN ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER SUFFERED FROM THE FMLN AGGRESSION, WITH MEDICINE, FOOD,
AND ESPECIALLY, THIS IS NEARLY FINALIZED, AID TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE
HOMES THAT WERE DAMAGED BY THIS SAVAGE AND IRRATIONAL FMLN ACTION.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH; GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS STATED THAT HE IS "PROUD AND HONORED" OVER
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SEVER RELATIONS
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, AND DESCRIBED THE SALVADORAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS A
"MURDERER."

   IN A SPEECH IN THE TOWN OF SOMOTILLO, ON THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS,
ORTEGA SAID THAT THE NEWS OF HIS SALVADORAN COLLEAGUE'S ANNOUNCEMENT
"FILLED ME WITH JOY BECAUSE WE WILL THUS AVOID RECEIVING THE PRESIDENT
OF A GOVERNMENT THAT MURDERS PRIESTS, NUNS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS."

   THE NICARAGUAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN SET AS THE SITE FOR THE CENTRAL

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WILL ASK THE INTERNATIONAL

INVOLVING [WORDS INDISTINCT] WORKERS, WHICH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS
CAUSED STREET VIOLENCE IN LIMA, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF
CONCERN FOR THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE STRIKE, WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE INTERSECTORIAL CONFEDERATION
OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES (CITE), IS BEING OBSERVED BY 300,000 PUBLIC
SERVANTS, WHO MAKE UP 50 PERCENT OF CITE MEMBERS. THE STRIKERS DEMAND
SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, THE REINSTATEMENT OF 250 DISMISSED WORKERS, AND
THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITE.

   RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) SECRETARY
GENERAL LUIZ ALVA CASTRO, WHO IS ALSO THE APRA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
REPORTED THAT TODAY HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX IN
SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

   ALVA SAID THAT "THERE IS GOOD WILL" TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT, WHICH HAS AFFECTED LARGE SECTORS OF THE POPULATION, WHO MAKE
USE OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, JUSTICE, TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMUNICATION
SERVICES. THE STRIKE HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE STATE, WHICH HAS FAILED TO
COLLECT 70 PERCENT OF TAXES BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY THE TAX
COLLECTORS.

   ALVA CASTRO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WILL
BE NO PROBLEM IN RECOGNIZING THE CITE, PROVIDED THAT THIS ORGANIZATION
MEETS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

   THERE WERE INCIDENTS IN LIMA ON 23 NOVEMBER, WHEN GROUPS OF CITE
MEMBERS DEMONSTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA AND WERE REPRESSED BY THE
POLICE. DURING THE INCIDENTS, BOMBS WERE DETONATED, TIRES WERE BURNED,
AND THE POLICE SHOT IN THE AIR. AT LEAST [9] PERSONS DIED DURING THE
INCIDENTS LAST WEEK.

   A UNION SOURCE TODAY SAID THAT A 15-DAY STRIKE BY 3,500 WORKERS OF
THE STATE-RUN MINERO PERU COMPANY HAS CAUSED DAILY LOSSES OF $800,000.

   ACCORDING TO THE LABOR MINISTRY, THE STRIKES HAVE COST THE PRIVATE
SECTOR 13 MILLION HOURS OF LABOR,

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE MINING SECTOR LOST $80 MILLION DURING
18 DAYS OF STRIKE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, WHILE THE FISHING SECTOR
HAS LOST $150 MILLION BECAUSE OF A STRIKE THAT THE WORKERS OF THE
SECTOR BEGAN 55 DAYS AGO.

[PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, AND I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE HEART.  ABOUT 15
DAYS AGO, I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, THE
SALVADORAN ARMY, WAS BOMBING NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES IN EL SALVADOR,
THAT IT WAS MURDERING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I LATER HEARD THAT THE
SALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST
WHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.  IT
WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK AND ASKED MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THE
PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR HERE IN NICARAGUA WHEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
SUMMIT IS HELD?  WHAT A PROBLEM.  A REAL PROBLEM.  HOW COULD I WELCOME
IN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND
BISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS
CLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES,
CATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS,
LABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN
600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.  THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLIC ALLIANCE], THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND
THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH IS THE SAME THING.  I KEPT ASKING MYSELF:
HOW CAN I WELCOME THEM IN NICARAGUA?  IT WOULD BE LIKE WELCOMING
SOMOZA.  ALL I COULD COME UP WITH WAS TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD
THE MEETING.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO
HAVE TO WELCOME AND HAVE AS A GUEST THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT
THAT KILLS PRIESTS, NUNS, WORKERS, LABORERS, PEASANTS, INTELLECTUALS,
PROFESSIONALS, AND WORKERS.  THEREFORE, THIS NEWS MADE ME HAPPY.  IT
MADE ME HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO
WELCOME, IN NICARAGUA, THE PRESIDENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL KILLERS AND COMMON CRIMINALS.  [APPLAUSE]

   THE TRUTH IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL PROUD.  AS A NICARAGUAN I FEEL
PROUD THAT THAT MURDEROUS GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA.  THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT
THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEASANT, ON THE SIDE OF THE
SALVADORAN WORKER, ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN CHURCH AND PRIESTS,
THAT WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND DEMOCRACY IN EL
SALVADOR, AND THAT WE OPPOSE TYRANNY IN EL SALVADOR.

   I CAN SEE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO SPEAK CLEARLY TO YOU.  I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK CLEARLY BECAUSE DIPLOMATIC
JARGON CAN SOMETIMES CONFUSE THINGS.  IT IS TIME THAT WE SPEAK
CLEARLY.  THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO
THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TO ASK AND DEMAND
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS
WITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE
PRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.  [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DEMAND.  THAT IS GOING TO BE OUR ANSWER.

   THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS UNEASY BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN EL SALVADOR.  CRISTIANI IS NO TAME DOVE.  HE HAS BECOME AN
ACCOMPLICE AND INSTRUMENT OF THIS POLICY OF DEATH IMPLEMENTED BY THE
ARMY, BY MEN LIKE [COLONEL RENE EMILIO] PONCE AND [GENERAL
JUAN RAFAEL] BUSTILLO.  THEY ARE MURDEROUS GUARDSMEN JUST LIKE
THOSE YOU KNEW, THE SOMOZIST GUARDSMEN.  BUSTILLO, PONCE, AND A FEW
OTHERS ARE JUST LIKE THAT.  HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE THAT.
THERE ARE SOME HONEST SOLDIERS IN EL SALVADOR, SOLDIERS WITH HONEST
POSITIONS.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0878 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 26 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] A
FEW DAYS AFTER THE START OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] OFFENSIVE, THE RESULTS ARE COMPLETELY POSITIVE.
FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE SEEING THE TOTAL POLITICAL DEFEAT OF THE
DEMOCRACY AND COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN BECAUSE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN UNMASKED AS A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.

   THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY MODEL TRIED TO LEGITIMIZE, THROUGH AN
ELECTORAL PROCESS, A QUOTE, DEMOCRATIC, UNQUOTE, GOVERNMENT WHICH
WOULD LEAVE THE GROWING POPULAR INSURGENCY IN EL SALVADOR WITH NO
REASON TO EXIST.  THAT MODEL HAS OVERWHELMINGLY FAILED BECAUSE,
INSTEAD OF AN EVEN TIMIDLY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, WHAT HAS BEEN
INSTALLED IS A REGIME THAT DOES NOT EVEN TOLERATE THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH IT VIEWS AS A GREAT TRAITOR TO THE FATHERLAND.
A REGIME HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT THE MOST MINIMAL
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT.  IT DOES NOT
TOLERATE THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT NEWSCAST, SUCH
AS THAT OF TELEVISION CANAL DOCE.  IT IS A REGIME WHICH DEMANDS THAT
THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THE CHURCH LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT DOES
NOT GUARANTEE THEIR SECURITY.  IT IS A REGIME THAT ISSUES TOTALLY
UNDEMOCRATIC LAWS AND CLOSES ALL POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES.  IN SHORT,
IT IS A REGIME IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.  IT IS A FASCIST REGIME WITH
ALL ITS COMPONENTS.  THAT IS THE FINAL RESULT OF THE U.S. EFFORTS TO
ESTABLISH A COUNTERINSURGENT DEMOCRATIC REGIME IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
LITTLE LEGITIMACY THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AT ONE POINT ENJOYED
WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT HAD TO COVER UP AND PERMIT THE ASSASSINATION OF
SIX JESUIT PRIESTS TO GO UNPUNISHED, AND WHEN IT INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBED THE MORE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.

   A FEW DAYS OF THE OFFENSIVE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TEAR DOWN THE
FOUNDATIONS OF THE ERRONEOUS U.S. POLICY IN OUR COUNTRY.  AND THE
VALIDITY OF THAT POLICY HAS BEGUN TO BE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED IN THE
UNITED STATES.

   A SECOND GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE FIRST WEEKS OF THE OFFENSIVE
HAS BEEN A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE THEATERS OF OPERATION.  WE HAVE
PLACED THE WAR IN ITS FINAL PHASE, IN ITS PHASE OF STRATEGIC
DEFINITION.  THERE HAS BEEN AN ABRUPT CHANGE IN WHAT HAD APPEARED TO
BE AN ENDLESS WAR AND AN UNBREAKABLE BALANCE OF FORCES.  THE TRANSFER
OF THE THEATERS OF OPERATION TO THE CITIES HAS RESULTED IN A STRATEGIC
SIEGE OF THE CITIES, WHICH ARE THE WEAK SPOTS OF THE POLITICAL,
ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL POWER. IN TURN, AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED
OUT, THIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN ACCELERATED POLITICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE
REGIME.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0879 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE
ENEMY IS LEFT LIKE THAT, HANGING FROM A THREAD -- A STRATEGIC THREAD
WHICH CAN BREAK AT ANY MOMENT AND RESULT IN A MILITARY SETBACK FOR THE
ARMY.  THE PHENOMENON WHICH ENSUED AFTER THE MASSES JOINED THE
OFFENSIVE IN ITS EARLY STAGES FORCED THE ENEMY TO INDISCRIMINATELY USE
THE AIR FORCE TO PREVENT A GENERAL UPRISING AND TO CURTAIL THE
INSURRECTION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFORT EXERTED TO LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE
OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE PEASANT AND SUBURBAN
INSURRECTION PROCESS.  OUR RANKS WERE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED TO RENDER
THE OFFENSIVE EFFECTIVE, AND THIS WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE'S
GREAT INTEREST IN FIGHTING IN THE CITIES AND SPEEDING UP THE OUTCOME
OF THE WAR.  THE PEOPLE ALSO JOINED OUR RANKS DURING THE FIGHTING
WHICH OCCURRED IN THE CITIES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE GERM OF A NEW SOCIAL EXPLOSION HAS BEEN CREATED BY
THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, WITH ITS INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND
REPRESSION.  EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE MAY BLAME THE FMLN FOR THE ARMY'S
BRUTAL REACTION, FEW CAN FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BOMBED
THEM.  THIS HAS CREATED A SOCIAL SITUATION WHICH GUARANTEES THE
CONTINUITY OF THE FMLN'S OFFENSIVE UNTIL VICTORY IS ACHIEVED.  ALL THE
PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE BOMBINGS ARE DISSATISFIED PEOPLE WHO WILL JOIN
THE STRUGGLE SOONER OR LATER.

   WE REMEMBER THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISPLACED PEOPLE AND REFUGEES
CAUSED BY THE BOMBINGS IN THE SALVADORAN COUNTRYSIDE.  THE BRUTAL
ATTITUDE OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE HAS LEGITIMIZED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.
THE OTHER PARTY, MEANING THE ENEMY, HAD TO GRAB ALL THE RESOURCES OF A
CONVENTIONAL WAR: AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.  THIS
LEGITIMIZES THE PEOPLE'S ARMED STRUGGLE AND SELF-DEFENSE.

   A THIRD GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AND STRATEGIC EFFORT
EXERTED AGAINST FASCISM HAS BEEN THE LIBERATION OF LARGE ZONES OF THE
NATIONAL TERRITORY.  A NEW, EMERGING POWER NOW CONTROLS EIGHT
DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE ARMY IS SPREAD THIN AND IT HAD TO
ABANDON THE ZONES WHERE IT CANNOT KEEP ITS MEN -- COMPROMISED AS IT IS
IN THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF THE CITIES.  THIS PUTS THE ARMY THROUGHOUT
THE NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A SITUATION RESEMBLING A CLOTH WITH MANY
HOLES, STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THREATENING TO RIP AT ANY POINT.
THE TEAR CAN OCCUR WHEN LEAST EXPECTED.  LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE
NOW IN THOSE LIBERATED TERRITORIES, ENGAGED IN A RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT
AND ORGANIZING A REARGUARD FOR THE MARCH ON THE CITIES.

   THERE IS A FOURTH ELEMENT TO CONSIDER: ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST
IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A BETTER BALANCE
FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMANDS AND PROPOSALS AT
THE NEGOTIATION TABLE ARE COMPLETELY NULL AND VOID.  THE PRETENSE OF
DEMANDING THE FMLN'S SURRENDER IS UNTIMELY GIVEN SUCH A SHOW OF
STRENGTH.  NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD NOW BE WILLING TO BET ON THAT
POSITION.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-0880 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THERE
IS NO LONGER ROOM FOR THE IDEA OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT NEGOTIATION.  NOW
WE MUST NEGOTIATE IN EARNEST.  THAT DEMAND HAS BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL
GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, AND EVEN BY SOME INFLUENTIAL
SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  YET CRISTIANI HAS OPPOSED THIS
UNIVERSAL CURRENT.  CRISTIANI'S TACTICAL, PROPAGANDISTIC, AND DELAYING
MOVES AROUND THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE WILL NO LONGER HAVE A CHANCE TO
SUCCEED.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WILL NOW BE AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION
THAT DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION BE EXPANDED AND THAT THE REAL
DECISIONMAKERS BE THE ONES WHO SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

   FINALLY, FOLLOWING THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN, THE
ANALYSTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS
A NEED TO CARRY OUT AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE VALUE OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.  THE DEBATE ON THE
CONDITIONING, AND EVEN THE TOTAL SUSPENSION, OF MILITARY AID TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY IS VERY INTENSE, AND IT HAS ALREADY SHAKEN THE
FOUNDATIONS OF BIPARTISANSHIP REGARDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE DEBATE HAS NOT CONTINUED BECAUSE
THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS DECLARED A RECESS; HOWEVER, IT WILL SOON BECOME
THE CENTER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS' DEBATES.

   IN SUMMARY, WE COULD SAY THAT THE ENEMY HAS LOST GROUND AND
LEGITIMACY, AND THE BASIS FOR ITS SUPPORT, THE U.S. AID, IS BEING
SERIOUSLY THREATENED.  IN ADDITION, THE ARMY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE
STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF AN IMPORTANT CENTER, THE CAPITAL CITY.
THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY LOGICAL TO SAY THAT TODAY WE SAW A VERY WORRIED,
EVEN DESPERATE, CRISTIANI.  CRISTIANI'S SPEECH ON THE RADIO AND
TELEVISION NETWORK SHOWS AN ATTEMPT TO RETOUCH THE PICTURE.  CRISTIANI
TRIED TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE WATER THAT HAS REACHED HIS NECK BY
DIVERTING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION FROM THE BOMBINGS AND THE DEATHS OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS TO NICARAGUA.  IN THIS DESPERATE EFFORT, ALL THAT
CRISTIANI HAS DONE IS TO TAKE THE WAR TO OTHER AND MORE DANGEROUS
LEVELS.  HE IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE THE WAR, AND THIS WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY ISOLATE HIM EVEN MORE FROM THE WORLD.

   THE OUTCOME OF THIS SITUATION DEPENDS ON ALL THESE FACTORS THAT CAN
ACCELERATE THE DECOMPOSITION OF FASCISM IN THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THEY
DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE VIGOR AND STRENGTH THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
PLACE ON THIS ONGOING AND IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE.

   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] AN AVIANCA BOEING 727 WITH 107
PEOPLE ON BOARD TODAY EXPLODED AT 07:18 HOURS (1218 GMT) ABOUT 22 KM
SOUTH OF BOGOTA, THE EL DORADO AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER IN BOGOTA
CONFIRMED.

   AERONAUTIC AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT A PLANE WITH REGISTRATION
NUMBER HK-1803 TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI TOOK OFF AT 07:13 FROM
THE BOGOTA AIRPORT. A FEW MINUTES LATER, WITNESSES REPORTED TO BOGOTA
RADIO STATIONS THAT THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR, BROKE IN TWO, AND
BURST INTO FLAMES.

   OCTAVIO FONSECA, A WITNESS WHO WAS NEAR WHERE THE PLANE FELL TOLD
CADENA RADIAL COLOMBIANA (CARACOL) THAT "THE PLANE EXPLODED IN THE AIR
AND BROKE IN TWO."

   HE ADDED: "I HAVE ALREADY GONE TO WHERE THE PLANE FELL. THE PLANE
IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, NO SURVIVORS, ONLY BURNT AND MANGLED
CORPSES."

   CLANDESTINE, 27 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION. PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.  ATTENTION.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY
REPORTED, U.S.  OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE
UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS.
THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE LADY WHO WITNESSED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY CRIME HAS CAUSED POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT IS ALSO BEING FELT
IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE U.S.  CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE
PENTAGON.

   EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION
PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN,
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND NOT
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  ABRAMS,
A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS
EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE
PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY
FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION.  WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF
GUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS.  HE ADDED
THAT, IN THE PAST, MANY MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS AND THE RIGHTIST SECTOR IN EL SALVADOR.
THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS BY ELLIOT ABRAMS.  VOA HAS REPORTED THE
STATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME.  AT THIS TIME IN THE
UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS
THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

   IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI
ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME.  WE DENOUNCE
THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL
PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.  WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF
JENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT.  ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING
TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED
ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.  IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS
AND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN
JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY
THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO
REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A
SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE
REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE
THAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.  IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS.

   IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN
AFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE
FMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS
LINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE
STRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND
AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO
THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
STATES.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS
A CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS
ASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS?  BEHIND THE CLUMSY
SET UP WITH REGARD TO THE U.S. CITIZEN, WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY INTEND
TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENT
SECTORS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY WITH EL SALVADOR.  IN SHORT,
ALL THIS SET UP ATTEMPTS TO DO IS THROW A HUGE SMOKESCREEN TO REPRESS
THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.

   SANTIAGO, 27 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE
RADIO MINERIA SANTIAGO STAFF CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ATTACK AT THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA.

   ERNANI VALDA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE RADIO STATION, HAS REPORTED
THAT SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 2.5 MILLION PESOS.

   THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GERMAN
GAMONAL, WHO IS ALSO THE PRESS DIRECTOR.  FIVE PEOPLE WERE WORKING AT
THE OFFICES WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED; ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.

   WE SPOKE WITH REPORTER HERMOGENES CARRILLO, WHO ARRIVED AT THE
RADIO STATION OFFICES AFTER THE ATTACK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CARRILLO] ONE PERSON SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES AND
THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE
BOMB ATTACK HERE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PROVIDENCIA AND TOBALABA
STREETS THIS MORNING AT 0510. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE RADIO STATION WAS OFF THE AIR FOR 45 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER BOMBS.

   GOPE [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] PERSONNEL ARRIVED LATER.
ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL THE BOMB CONTAINED TRONEX
[EXPANSION UNKNOWN], AND IT HAD BEEN PLACED BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON
PROVIDENCIA STREET.

   AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK.  THEY
SOMEHOW CLIMBED TO THE SECOND FLOOR, PLACED THE BOMB, LIT THE FUSE,
AND FLED.

   NO WARNING WAS RECEIVED NOR HAS ANY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK SO FAR.

   WE HAVE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM OUR LISTENERS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED IMPORTANT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI AND INTERIOR MINISTER
CARLOS CACERES.

   AMONG OTHERS, WE HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OSORNO FROM
[PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] FRANCISCO JAVIER ERRAZURIZ AND
ANOTHER CALL FROM SANTIAGO FROM RICARDO LAGOS.

   THIS IS ALL WE CAN REPORT FOR NOW.  THE COST HAS NOT YET BEEN
ESTIMATED, BUT IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL.

   THIS WAS A REPORT BY RADIO MINERIA FOR RADIO NACIONAL DE CHILE.

   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] POLICE SOURCES HAVE DESCRIBED THE
ANNONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL TO RADIO CADENA CARACOL BLAMING "THE
EXTRADITABLES" DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP FOR THE EXPLOSION ON BOARD AN
AVIANCA BOEING 727 AS "LACKING CREDIBILITY."  THE PLANE WAS ON A
FLIGHT FROM BOGOTA TO CALI WITH 107 PERSONS ABOARD. THE ANNONYMOUS
CALLER SAID THAT "THE EXTRADITABLES" HAD PLANTED A BOMB ON THAT PLANE
BECAUSE "FIVE INFORMERS" WERE ABOARD.

   HOWEVER, POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE WERE SKEPTICAL, DESCRIBING
WHAT THE ANNONYMOUS CALLER HAD SAID AS LACKING CREDIBILITY. ANOTHER
POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE ANNONYMOUS PHONE CALL BLAMING "THE
EXTRADITABLES" FOR THE EXPLOSION SOUNDED MORE LIKE A JOKE IN BAD
TASTE.  HE ADDED THAT THE CALL DOES NOT FOLLOW THE NORMAL PATTERN USED
BY THAT GROUP WHEN CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS. THE GROUP
USUALLY SENDS COMMUNIQUES TO THE MEDIA.  THESE COMMUNIQUES ARE WRITTEN
ON PAPER WITH THE GROUP'S LETTERHEAD AND ARE DULY SIGNED, AND AT TIMES
INCLUDE THE FINGERPRINTS OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE
COMMUNIQUE.

   A SPOKESPERSON AT EL DORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN BOGOTA, FROM
WHERE THE PLANE TOOK OFF, SAID THAT IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
SOMEONE TO HAVE EVADED THE STRICT SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT. THE SOURCE
ADDED THAT THE PASSENGERS AND THE LUGGAGE UNDERWENT ROUTINE BUT
RIGOROUS SECURITY CHECKS.  THESE SECURITY CHECKS INCLUDE HAND CHECKS
AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND EXPLOSIVES-DETECTING DOGS.
THE SOURCE ADDED THAT NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS NOTICED.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES" IS AN ARMED GROUP UNDER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
THAT FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE EXTRADITION OF
COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED STATES.  UP TO NOW THE CRIMES THAT THE GROUP
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND OTHERS FOR WHICH IT IS BLAMED,
HAVE ALL FALLEN UNDER THE CATEGORY OF SELECTIVE MURDERS BUT NEVER AN
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK LIKE DESTROYING A PLANE.

   CIVIL AERONAUTICS DIRECTORATE SOURCES SAID THAT THE BLACK BOX HAS
BEEN FOUND AND THAT ITS CONTENTS WILL PROBABLY REVEAL WHAT HAPPENED.

   THE SOURCES ADDED THAT 8 HOURS AFTER THE TRAGEDY, THERE ARE STILL
NO CLUES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE WHETHER THIS WAS
AN ATTACK OR AN ACCIDENT.

   MOST OF THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE PLANE WERE GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE TRAVELING FROM BOGOTA TO CALI, IN THE
SOUTHEASTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY, FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

ALLEGED NICARAGUAN PILOT THAT WAS KILLED IN EL SALVADOR IS ALIVE AND
WELL, IN MANAGUA, TALKING WITH US.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAID
MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA WAS KILLED IN AN ALLEGED TRANSSHIPMENT OF
WEAPONS LAST SATURDAY, 25 NOVEMBER WHEN A CESSNA PLANE CRASHED.
MAURICIO QUIROS GARCIA, 36-YEARS-OLD, IS HERE, NEXT TO ME.  HE IS
MARRIED AND HAS CHILDREN.  GOOD EVENING, MAURICIO.

   [QUIROS GARCIA] GOOD EVENING.  I AM SO SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED
OVER THIS REPORT, THAT I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN HOW I FELT
WHEN I WAS CALLED.  AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE.  HOWEVER, AFTER
RECEIVING SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS FROM SEVERAL NEWSMEN, I STARTED TO
THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS.  I WANT TO CLARIFY AND EXPLAIN THAT THIS
REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE.

   [CABRERA] MAURICIO, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SAYS YOU ARE A FORMER
PILOT OF THE SANDINIST AIR FORCE, FAS.  IS THAT TRUE?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] THAT IS TRUE.  I WAS IN THE FAS FOR 2 YEARS, AND
NOW, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AERONICA FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS.

   [CABRERA] WHAT TYPES OF FLIGHTS DO YOU MAKE?  TO WHERE DO YOU FLY
AND FROM WHERE?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS.  I AM THE CAPTAIN
OF A BOEING 727.  WE FLY TO PANAMA CITY; SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA; MEXICO
CITY, AND GUATEMALA CITY.

   [CABRERA] WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] IN MEXICO.

   [CABRERA] WERE YOU EVER INVOLVED WITH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY TYPE OF
WEAPONS?  THE REPORTS MENTION SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT.  DID YOU JUST
UNLOAD ALL THAT IN EL SALVADOR, AND TURNED AROUND SO QUICKLY, THAT YOU
WERE IN SEVERAL PLACES ON SATURDAY?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] I DO NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION ABOUT
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS, OR ANYTHING ELSE.  MY JOB IS TO PILOT A PLANE,
AND THAT IS WHAT I DO; I PILOT THE AERONICA PLANE AND THAT IS IT.

   [CABRERA] MAURICIO, DO YOU KNOW THE FMLN WELL?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] NO, I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE FROM THE FMLN.  I HAVE NO
RELATIONS WITH ANYONE LINKED AT ALL TO THE FMLN.

   [CABRERA] SO WHY SHOULD ANYONE WANT TO REPORT THAT YOU WERE KILLED
EARLY IN THE MORNING IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT?

   [QUIROS GARCIA] WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT REPORT HAS SURPRISED
ME.  FRANKLY SPEAKING, I DO NOT KNOW.  THIS SHOWS THAT CERTAIN
GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES ISSUE TOTALLY FALSE REPORTS IN ORDER TO HIDE OR,
I DO NOT KNOW [CHANGES THOUGHT] THAT REPORT IS TOTALLY FALSE.  THAT IS
ALL I CAN SAY.  AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM VERY CONCERNED, AND JUST AS
SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.  [CONTINUED]

[NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] EL SALVADOR
HAS CARRIED OUT A CONSTANT AND PERMANENT AGGRESSION AGAINST NICARAGUA
AND NICARAGUA HAS NEVER SUGGESTED BREAKING RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR.
NICARAGUA HAS NOT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BREAKING RELATIONS WITH HONDURAS.
ON THE CONTRARY, WE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO FOLLOW A POLICY OF
NEGOTIATIONS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FOOLING
OURSELVES.  THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED.
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT TO MOBILIZE THE
CONTRAS; THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS ALSO COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST ALSO BE FULFILLED.  EL
SALVADOR MUST FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS
NOT RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR, THEY ARE KILLING PEOPLE IN
EL SALVADOR, THEY HAVE BOMBED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE
KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS, THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT MUST EXPRESS ITS
SOLIDARITY WITH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE
ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING.  WE CANNOT BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH AN ARMY THAT
IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY
GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THAT ARMY WHICH IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT IS BOMBING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT
HAS KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY
GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THE ARMY.  I ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THE
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WILL EXPRESS THEIR
SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   SHORTLY BEFORE COMING HERE THIS EVENING, I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS
VIA SATELLITE, AND I SAW PROTEST DEMOSTRATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE
BOMBINGS IN EL SALVADOR.  CHRISTIANS, CATHOLICS, CLERGYMEN, AND
PRIESTS ARE PROTESTING IN THE UNITED STATES [WORDS INDISTINCT].
THEREFORE, OUR POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR.  WE DO NOT RENOUNCE THE PEACE
AGREEMENTS.  WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM, AND WE WILL DEMAND THAT THE
AGREEMENTS BE FULFILLED.  WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THOSE AGREEMENTS AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.  WHAT IS
NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR IS A CEASE-FIRE.  A REAL CEASE-FIRE AND
NEGOTIATIONS ARE NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL
ALLOW PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  NO ONE CAN BE HAPPY WITH
THAT KIND OF A DEMOCRATIC REGIME -- LIKE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBE IT. THAT GOVERNMENT IS KNOWN FOR
KILLING PEOPLE, FOR KILLING CLERGYMEN.  HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED
IN EL SALVADOR.

   I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO CAME FROM THE VARIOUS REGIONS
TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO ATTEND THIS MEETING DURING WHICH, IN ADDITION TO
DISCUSSING SEVERAL MATTERS OF INTEREST FOR ALL THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE,
WE ALSO HONORED OUR EVANGELISTIC BROTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED HERE IN
NICARAGUA FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS AND GAVE
 POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION TO OUR JESUIT BROTHERS, THE PRIESTS BRUTALLY
MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WE ARE DETERMINED TO        
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, THE PREACHERS OF THE
GOSPEL, THE EVANGELISTS AND ALL THE CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR A
NICARAGUA IN PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  ONCE AGAIN I WISH TO REITERATE:
BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND REVOLUTION, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJETED THE PROPOSAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE
CEASE-FIRE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
ACCORDING TO MAURICIO SANDOVAL, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATIONS.  SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S.  NEWS AGENCY
UPI.

   THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE RECOMMENDATION
CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE
VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH
OFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER
OSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA.

   ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS
SALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE.  IN THE COURSE
OF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS.

   IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S
ADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED
FRUITS.  THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO
WORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A
LAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS
ALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF
PEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.

   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND
CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE
ACURSED DEATH SQUADS.  AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION,
HAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF [WORD INDISTINCT], ARRESTS OF AND THREATS
AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN
ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE
AGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO
ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT
GUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY.

   DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT
DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE
U.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE.  THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS
OBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE
GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.

   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S
POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE
OUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE
DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID
HELLISH TORTURES.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION.

   THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE
FICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT
SUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN
DOWNPLAYED.  HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S.
SUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG
TIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE
STRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.  


DEV-MUC3-0888 (GTE)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 22 NOV 89 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES, IN
THE PAST FEW DAYS MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN EL SALVADOR
AFTER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND
THE GUERRILLAS.  MIKHAIL MAYOROV FILED THIS REPORT:

   THE HORRIFYING REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES GIVE AN
APPROPRIATE IDEA OF THE TRAGEDY IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE A CIVIL WAR IS
RAVAGING THE COUNTRY.  ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
FIGHT IS BEING WAGED, THE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BURN DEAD BODIES RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES.

   THE VICTIMS ARE NOT ONLY SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS, WHO ARE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT, BUT ALSO CIVILIANS, WHOSE HOUSES ARE HIT BY
BOMBS AND PROJECTILES.  THE CIVILIANS ARE CONSTANTLY THREATENED BY THE
BULLIES OF THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, WHO MURDERED SIX CATHOLIC
PRIESTS AT THE SAN SALVADOR UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

   THE SALVADORAN SITUATION, WHICH HAS CAUSED SERIOUS CONCERN, CANNOT
BE REGARDED AS SOMETHING WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE WORLD NOW SEEMS TO BE
STRONGER THAN EVER.  WE HAVE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE OLD
SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ISOLATED TRAGEDY.  WE FEEL INCREASINGLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SO-CALLED HOT SPOTS OF THE
PLANET.

   OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IS
TO STEM THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT FLOW OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO BOTH
SIDES.

   MOSCOW HAS ALREADY TAKEN THIS POSITION.  HOWEVER, U.S. PRESIDENT
GEORGE BUSH HAS TERMED INADMISSIBLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HALTING THE AID
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   IF WE COMPARE THE SALVADORAN AND THE AFGHAN SITUATIONS, WHY DOES
THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION SO BITTERLY REPPROACHED US FOR HELPING THE
NAJIBULLAH REGIME?

   WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT YET ADOPTED GENERAL CRITERIA.

   OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS CONSISTENT, MAYOROV SAYS. IN MY OPINION,
SOVIET DIPLOMACY HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED ITS
CONSERVATIVE STAND, WHICH MADE US SUPPORT JUST ONE SIDE.  IN THE FINAL
ANALYSIS, THE WAR IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, AND THE MAGNITUDE
OF THE TRAGEDY GROWS AS THE CONFLICT BECOMES MORE SERIOUS.

   THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WILL REFLECT THE WILLINGNESS THAT MOSCOW
AND WASHINGTON HAVE TO HELP A SMALL NATION, WHICH IS TIRED OF A 
LONG-STANDING CONFLICT, FIND A WAY TOWARDS PEACE.

   ALL OF US ARE WAITING FOR THE SOVIET-U.S. SUMMIT WHICH WILL BE HELD
OFF THE COAST OF MALTA.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE ISSUES THAT
WILL BE ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE THE MEETING WILL BE UNOFFICIAL [AS
HEARD].

   THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED IN A BILATERAL SUMMIT.
IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH SIDES REACH AN
UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION
FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PROBLEM.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 28 NOV 89 (PL) -- [TEXT] HEAVY CLASHES ARE
STILL TAKING PLACE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR FOLLOWING A NIGHT OF
FIERCE COMBAT, WHICH CONFIRMS PREDICTIONS ON THE INTENSIFICATION OF
THE WAR THIS WEEK.

   PRESS REPORTS RELEASED FROM SAN SALVADOR AT NOON TODAY REPORT THE
CONTINUATION OF CLASHES BETWEEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] AND THE ARMED FORCES, BASICALLY IN
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, ZACAMIL, AND SAN RAMON, ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADO, SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED AGAIN BY GUERRILLA COLUMNS,
WHICH CONTROLLED THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF THE
NATIONAL OFFENSIVE WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   IN ITS MOST RECENT NEWSCAST, THE FMLN'S RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED
THE AIR FORCE HEAVILY BOMBED AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A DENSELY POPULATED
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND CONFIRMED THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE IN SOYAPANGO.

   THE SOURCE REPORTED THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ELITE TROOPS, AND
EVEN INFANTRY BRIGADES FROM MILITARY DETACHMENTS TRADITIONALY
STATIONED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO SAN SALVADOR IN AN
ATTEMPT TO REPEL THE REBELS' ACTIONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA REPORTS, DESPITE THE CONTINUOUS
BOMBINGS, CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME IN THE CAPITAL OF SAN
MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  SEVERAL
SECTORS OF THE PANAMERICAN HIGHWAY, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN SAN
SALVADOR, REMAIN UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL, RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTED.

   THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MEDIA TODAY WARNED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF
THE INCIDENTS IN SAN SALVADOR THIS MORNING, WHEN GROUPS OF
UNIDENTIFIED MEN MACHINEGUNNED FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO GUERRERO, A WELL- KNOWN LEADER OF THE RIGHTWING NATIONAL
CONCILIATION PARTY. SOURCES CONSULTED IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH PREFER
NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED, SAID IT IS A FACT THE FAR RIGHTWING IS LINKED TO
THIS CRIME.  THE SAME SOURCES MAINTAINED THAT THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE SUSPENSION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA, MADE BY
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, CAUSED DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE GOVERNMENT
BRANCHES AND AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES.

   CLANDESTINE, 28 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE
RECEIVED A REPORT ADVISING US THAT AT 0200 [0800 GMT] TODAY, FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.
THE REPORT ALSO ADDS THAT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING, FIGHTING HAS BEEN
GOING ON IN GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALSO IN SOYAPANGO.  REPORTS FROM
OTHER AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR SPEAK OF HEAVY CLASHES SINCE EARLY THIS
MORNING.  THE REPORT STATES THAT AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED
TWO 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COBRA BATTALION COMPANIES IN SAN SALVADOR.
THE TROOPS WERE IN EL CARMEN HILL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE JURISDICTION.  THE
REPORT ADDS THAT THE FMLN INFLICTED TWO DEAD AND THREE WOUNDED,
INCLUDING A SERGEANT AND A CORPORAL.  THIS MEANS THAT THE 4TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE IS ALREADY IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE IN SAN
SALVADOR: SONSONATE TROOPS, 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, AND 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ARE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS PROOF OF HOW BAD
THE ENEMY IS DOING.

   THE REPORT ADDS THAT SINCE THIS MORNING, FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL
BATTALION TROOPS WAS REPORTED IN THE AREA AROUND EL CARMEN HILL.  THE
ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS WERE GOING TO REINFORCE THE COWARDLY 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WHO HAVE LEFT CHALATENANGO AND ARE NOW IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THE FIGHTING ENDED AT 0930 [1530 GMT].

   WE REPEAT: AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.  FIGHTING WAS ALSO
REPORTED IN SAN JACINTO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, SANTA
EDUVIGES, ESCANDIA NEIGHBORHOOD, EL CARMEN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OTHER
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR.  WE ARE WAITING FOR MORE REPORTS BECAUSE WE
HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING HAS RESUMED IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

   TO ADD TO THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WE WISH TO
STATE THAT HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN GUADALUPE
NEIGHBORHOOD, SOYAPANGO.  AT 0600 [1200 GMT], NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
WERE AMBUSHED AT KM 11 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.  THE NATIONAL GUARD
SUFFERED DEAD AND WOUNDED DURING THAT AMBUSH.  WE WILL HAVE MORE
INFORMATION ON THIS AMBUSH LATER.  


DEV-MUC3-0892 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[BEGIN RECORDING] [COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF] THIS AGAIN PROVES THE
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAINST POOR PEOPLE, AND AGAINST OUR
COUNTRY'S DISTINGUISHED POLITICIANS.  THIS IS ADDED TO THE INNOCENT
LIVES TAKEN BY THE FMLN FROM THE SALVADORAN POPULATION.  I WANT TO
TELL YOU WE HAVE A PERSON UNDER ARREST WHO WAS WOUNDED RIGHT WHERE THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE, BY DR. GUERRERO'S BODYGUARD.  WE HAVE HIS IDENTITY,
HE IS AFFILITATED TO THE FMLN, BUT WE WILL NOT RELEASE HIS NAME WHILE
THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE BEST
WITNESS TO THE FMLN AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE TERRORISTS CARRY OUT THESE
ACTIONS AS PART OF THEIR STRATEGY TO SCARE THE POPULATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE WANT TO SAY THAT CONDITIONS TO ENABLE
MARXISM AND THE FMLN TO WIN ARE PRACTICALLY NIL.  THE PEOPLE
COMPLETELY REJECT THEM.  THE FMLN ARE USING THAT LYING AND LOSING
VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION TO FOOL THEIR OWN CADRES.  IN NICARAGUA,
THERE WERE SOME STATIONS THAT WERE IN NETWORK WITH THIS LYING AND
LOSING VENCEREMOS RADIO STATION, BROADCASTING FALSE REPORTS ABOUT EL
SALVADOR.  THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE AGGRESSION.  TO ALLOW THEIR
SO-CALLED HIGH-RANKING FMLN COMMANDERS TO BE IN NICARAGUA IS ALSO PART
OF THE AGGRESSION.  NO ONE CAN IGNORE THE AGGRESSION THAT THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EXERTING FOR A LONG TIME AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] HAVING FOUND THESE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS,
DOES IT MEAN YOU MAY EXPECT THE AGGRESSIVE COUNTEROFFENSIVE THESE
GROUPS ARE LAUNCHING MAY WIDEN?

   [PONCE] DEFINITELY NOT.  WE BELIEVE THEIR CADRES ARE DECIMATED.
THIS COULD AFFECT MAINLY OUR AIR FORCE; HOWEVER, WE ARE TAKING THE
PROPER TACTICAL AND TECHNICAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES.  WHAT SHOULD BE
VERY CLEAR TO ALL SALVADORANS IS THAT FOR THE FMLN TO ATTAIN POWER,
WHICH IS THEIR GOAL, THEY WILL HAVE TO CLIMB OVER THE BODY OF THE LAST
ARMED FORCES SOLDIER.  [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE MISSILES AND OTHER WEAPONS
SENT BY ORTEGA FOR THE FMLN ARE AGRESSIONS AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, EXPLAINING THAT IT WAS A NICARAGUAN WHO LIVES IN THIS CAPITAL
WHO IDENTIFIED THE MAN WHO PILOTED THE SMALL AIRCRAFT CARRYING THE
WEAPONS FOR THE TERRORISTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] HE SAID THAT IT WAS QUIROS GARCIA.
HOWEVER, THAT EVENING HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT THE PILOT SHOULD
HAVE PART OF HIS THUMB MISSING, AND TO PLEASE CHECK HIM OUT.  THE BODY
WE HAVE WAS CHECKED AND ONE OF THE THUMBS HAS A PART MISSING.  TO US
THIS IS IRREFUTABLE PROOF.  WE ALL KNOW OF ORTEGA'S CYNCISM.  ON THE
ONE HAND, HE MADE PROMISES AT ESQUIPULAS II, SIGNING AGREEMENTS HE WAS
NOT PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT; HE WOULD NOT DO IT SINCE HE WAS REALLY
DOING THESE OTHER THINGS.  HE IS THE SAME AS THE FMLN. THE FMLN WAS
DISCUSSING PEACE AT A DIALOGUE TABLE WHILE IT WAS PREPARING FOR THIS
OFFENSIVE.  IT IS A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEIR DESIRE FOR
PEACE HAS BEEN FOOLED WITH.  DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION
HAVE BEEN FOOLED.  [END RECORDING]

   [ANNOUNCER] FINALLY, PONCE SAID THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS HAVE LOW
MORALE AND ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE IF DANIEL ORTEGA LOSES THE
ELECTIONS, THEY, TOO, WILL LOSE, AND FOREVER.  ADDITIONALLY, THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR IRRATIONAL ACTIONS THAT ONLY
PRODUCE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS
PROFOUND INDIGNATION OVER THE MURDER OF DR.  FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO,
PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.  THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED
BY TERRORISTS AT ABOUT 0930 [1530 GMT] THIS MORNING.  ACCORDING TO
WITNESSES, THE TERRORISTS DROVE A YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ORDERED A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION TO
DETERMINE WHO MURDERED DR GUERRERO AND TO BRING THEM TO TRIAL
ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN PENAL CODE, WHICH WAS MODIFIED A FEW DAYS
AGO.  BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THESE
CRIMES, BECAUSE THEY ONLY BRING MORE GRIEF AND PAIN TO THE SUFFERING
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE HAVE DIED
AND 13 MORE WERE WOUNDED -- INCLUDING SOLDIERS, REBELS, AND CIVILIANS
-- IN THE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS IN SAN
SALVADOR AND 2 DEPARTMENTS IN THE NORTH AND EAST OF EL SALVADOR,
ACCORDING TO MILITARY REPORTS.

   FOUR GUERRILLAS DIED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED IN
CONFRONTATIONS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE CITIES OF
MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO, LOCATED NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, ACCORDING
TO THE SAME REPORTS.

   THE CONFRONTATIONS, IN WHICH CARBINES, MORTARS, AND EXPLOSIVES WERE
USED, BEGAN AT 0230 (0830 GMT), WHEN THE REBELS "TRIED TO ENTER" THE
NORTHERN SUBURBS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THEY WERE "REPELLED" BY
GOVERNMENT TROOPS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING TO THE
ARMY'S PRESS OFFICE.

   ANOTHER FOUR GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND TWO WERE WOUNDED IN ARMED
CONFRONTATIONS IN TONACATEPEQUE, 16 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND IN
CHALATENANGO AND SAN MIGUEL, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
OF THE COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY.

   THE ARMY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND ANOTHER FIVE
WERE WOUNDED IN THOSE PLACES.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE STATED THAT FOUR EMPLOYEES OF THE RIO LEMPA
HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION WERE WOUNDED BY EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD
BEEN PLACED BY THE REBELS IN A TECHNICAL INSTITUTE LOCATED IN THE
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR SOME DAYS BY THE
REBELS DURING THE RECENT OFFENSIVE.

   THE ARMY ALSO INDICATES THAT THE REBELS SET FIRE TO A CAR AND
ANOTHER TWO VEHICLES IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL.


DEV-MUC3-0895 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] IN LIGHT OF THE TERRORIST ARMED
AGGRESSION LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WITH THE OPEN SUPPORT AND
DIRECTION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA ON 11
NOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ADVISES THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY THAT ON THE DAY THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE, IT
EXPRESSED ITS FIRM DESIRE TO SEEK, THROUGH THE CIVILIZED PATH OF
DIALOGUE, A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT BECAUSE THE MARXIST
- LENINIST GROUP'S CAUSE BRINGS BLOODSHED TO OUR PEOPLE.  IN THIS
SENSE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT PROMOTED THE PROCESS OF
DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO CITY ON 13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER 1989.
AT THAT TIME, GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT
COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO SEEK AN END TO HOSTILITIES WITHIN THE SPIRIT
OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TELA,
HONDURAS.  BASED ON THE AGREEMENT REACHED IN MEXICO CITY, THE ISSUE TO
BE BROACHED DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA, ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER WOULD BE THE END TO HOSTILITIES BASED
ON PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  AT THAT TIME,
THE FMLN DID NOT ALLOW THE DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC PREVIOUSLY AGREED
ON AND PRESENTED A SERIES OF PROPOSALS, DELIBERATELY COMPLEX IN FORM
AND CONTENT, WITH THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE MAIN AND ONLY
TOPIC ON THE AGENDA FROM BEING DISCUSSED.

   ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN AGGRESSION THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY PLANNED AT LEAST A
FEW MONTHS BEFORE IT WAS LAUNCHED.  THIS PROVES THAT WHILE THE FMLN
WAS TALKING PEACE AND NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, IT
WAS, WITH THE POLITICAL, LOGISTICAL, AND MILITARY SUPPORT OF ORTEGA'S
GOVERNMENT, PREPARING THE CRIMINAL ATTACK AGAINST THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.

   SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION TO DATE, CERTAIN
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT PROVE THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT
IN THE GENOCIDE IMPLEMENTED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT HAS PROOF THAT THE FMLN IS A PUPPET OF DANIEL ORTEGA'S
DEADLY PLANS WHO, FACED WITH AN IMMINENT ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND IN
CONJUNCTION WITH FIDEL CASTRO, IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE IN CENTRAL
AMERICA AN ARMED CONFLICT TO TRY TO SAVE THE SANDINIST REGIME.

   IN LIGHT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AND HAVING ESTABLISHED THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION
EXPERIENCED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
AGREED, ON 26 NOVEMBER 1989, TO SUSPEND DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL
RELATIONS WITH THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND RECALLED ITS DIPLOMATIC
MISSION FOR CONSULTATIONS.  IN LIGHT OF THESE SERIOUS ACTIONS WHICH
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED
FORMAL CHARGES BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS SO THAT IMMEDIATE
AND EFFICIENT MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO REPUDIATE
 THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS AND SO THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WILL      
BE DIPLOMATICALLY AND POLITICALLY PRESSURED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION
IT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST EL SALVADOR, AND THUS STOP A POSSIBLE           
CONFLICT OF UNPREDICTABLE DIMENSIONS.

   HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT A TIME LIKE THIS, WHEN AROUND THE WORLD
MOMENTS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN PLACES LIKE
POLAND, THE GDR, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, AND HUNGARY, HERE, IN EL SALVADOR,
BECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS -- WITH ORTEGA'S SUPPORT --
ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO DROWN A NATION WHICH, DESPITE 10 YEARS OF
WAR, IS TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS?

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE UNITED DURING THIS
HISTORIC TEST TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] DEPUTY DEFENSE
MINISTER COLONEL JUAN ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES
STRUCTURE REMAINS INTACT AND THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF LAUNCHING ANOTHER
OFFENSIVE.  COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST'S INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK
WAS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND NOT AGAINST THE
MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY CHIEF, THE TERRORISTS WERE TRYING
TO ENCOURAGE AN UPRISING AMONG THE PEOPLE; HOWEVER, THEY FAILED IN
THEIR ATTEMPT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND GAVE
THEIR SUPPORT TO THE ARMED FORCES.  COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE SUPPORT
OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL AND VERY
IMPORTANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE FMLN'S COMMUNIST ATTACK.  THE DEPUTY
DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT THANKS TO THIS TOTAL SUPPORT, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE A LOT OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION.  COL
ZEPEDA MENTIONED THE ALTOS DE LA CUEVA CASE IN SAN MIGUEL, WHERE
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE FOUND.  ZEPEDA
CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES,
ADDING THAT THE ARMED FORCES' MORALE IS HIGH, VERY HIGH.

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
ATTENTION.  WE HAVE LAST MINUTE INFORMATION.

   ATTENTION.  FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] FORCES
HAVE BROKEN THE SIEGE THAT THE FASCIST TROOPS WERE MAINTAINING AROUND
NORTHWESTERN AND NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ATTENTION.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED
FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.  WE REPEAT.  WE ARE FIGHTING IN
AREAS CLOSE TO THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS.  WE ARE
FIGHTING IN LA SULTANA NEIGHBORHOOD, ON THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY AND
AROUND THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING.

   OUR UNITS ENTERED THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD INHABITED BY
HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS AND OCCUPIED SEVERAL HOUSES THERE.  OUR
FORCES FOUND ARSENALS IN SOME OF THE HOUSES AND CLASHED AGAINST ENEMY
TROOPS.

   OUR FORCES SEIZED MANY WEAPONS INCLUDING RIFLES, MACHINEGUNS,
AMMUNITION, AND OTHER WAR MATERIAL.  ALL THOSE WEAPONS WERE FOUND IN
THE HOUSES OF SEVERAL HIGH-RANKING MILITARY CHIEFS IN THE MANUEL JOSE
ARCE NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS ON CLASHES IN THE AREA OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN
WHERE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 6 REINFORCEMENTS REFUSED TO ADVANCE.  THE
SONSONATE TROOPS REFUSED TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS IN THE AREA
OF ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN.

   SIMILARLY, OUR FORCES ARE HOLDING POSITIONS IN SOYAPANGO,
MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  OUR FORCES ALSO HAVE
CONTROL OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK HIGHWAY AND OTHER IMPORTANT ROUTES
LEADING TO SAN SALVADOR.

   THERE ARE CLASHES AGAINST BRACAMONTE BATTALION TROOPS IN LA SULTANA
NEIGHBORHOOD, SAN FRANCISCO, AND ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN.  THE ENEMY HAS
REACTED IN FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS.  THE ENEMY SENT BRACAMONTE BATTALION
REINFORCEMENTS IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT THEIR ADVANCE WAS NEUTRALIZED AND
HALTED AT THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE REPEAT.  THE FIRST HIGH
COMMAND RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN
SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING BRACAMONTE BATTALION
REINFORCEMENTS HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED.  OUR FORCES AMBUSHED AND
NEUTRALIZED THOSE BRACAMONTE BATTALION REINFORCEMENTS.

   A SECOND ENEMY RESPONSE TO OUR INCURSION INTO AND CONTROL OF
NORTHWESTERN AND WESTERN SAN SALVADOR MOVED ALONG THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY
AND WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND THEREFORE
NEUTRALIZED.  THE ENEMY'S THIRD RESPONSE MOVING THROUGH SANTA TECLA
WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY OUR FORCES AND HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED WITH AN
AMBUSH NEAR LA UNIVERSAL AND GUADALUPE GARDENS.  THESE ATLACATL
BATTALION FORCES WERE ALSO NEUTRALIZED.

   WE ARE RECEIVING THIS REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE HIGH COMMAND'S
FIRST AND BELATED RESPONSE INCLUDED FOUR MOVEMENTS, WHICH WERE ALL
HALTED BY OUR FORCES.  THOSE FOUR HIGH COMMAND DEFENSIVE MOVEMENTS
HAVE BEEN ATTACKED AND NEUTRALIZED.  BOTH THE BRACAMONTE AND THE
ATLACATL BATTALIONS HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED.  MEANWHILE THE TROOPS
COMING FROM SONSONATE REFUSED TO ADVANCE IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   CLASHES NOW COVER A LARGE AREA FROM THE HIGHWAY LINKING SANTA
 TECLA AND SAN SALVADOR AND THROUGH LA MASCOTA, LAS PALMAS, SAN          
BENITO, MAQUILIGUE, CAMPESTRE, LOMAS VERDES, ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS,
CONTINUING TO THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO AND MOVING THROUGH THE ENTIRE     
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR INCLUDING AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CUSCATANCINGO,            
NORTHERN MEJICANOS, AND MEJICANOS ITSELF AND THEN MOVING TO CIUDAD
DELGADO, SOYAPANGO, AND THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE PAN-AMERICAN
HIGHWAY, WHERE OUR UNITS MAINTAIN POSITIONS AND ARE ADVANCING TOWARD
ENEMY FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT THIS HOUR THE FMLN HAS FORMED THE
LARGEST ARCH OF ATTACKS DURING OUR FORCES' ENTIRE OCCUPATION OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT THE GENERAL STAFF HAS ERECTED A HUMAN WALL, ERECTED BY COLONEL
RENE EMILIO PONCE, FOLLOWING THE ARTILLERY ATTACK STAGED BY US AT 0515
THIS MORNING ON THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  IT WAS REPORTED THAT
HUNDREDS OF LITTLE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN PLACED AS CANNON FODDER OUTSIDE
THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  THIS GIVES US NEW INTELLIGENCE DATA
ON THE MORALE OF COL PONCE, HOW THE CRISIS IS AFFECTING HIM.  WITHOUT
ANY MILITARY CRITERION, HE HAS PLACED A WALL OF SOLDIERS AROUND THE
GENERAL STAFF INSTALATIONS.  THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
GIVEN TO US BY COL PONCE, CONCERNING HIS PHYSICAL STATE AND CONCERNING
THE UPSET BEING SUFFERED BY THE STRATEGIC ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF
COMMAND.

   WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY CLUB, THE MAQUILIGUAS,
SAN BENITO, AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON THAT
COMBAT ZONE.  THE FIGHTING WILL GET WORSE AND THE AIR FORCE WILL BOMB
THE FMLN POSITIONS IN SAN BENITO AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS, THEREFORE
ITS INHABITANTS ARE URGED TO ABANDON THAT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   A REPORT FROM USULUTAN INDICATES AT THIS TIME THAT THE FMLN UNITS
ARE ADVANCING AND FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR OF GAVIRIA, EL MANGUITO, AND
LOS PILOTOS NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  ALSO, IN THE AREA
OF SANTA ELENA THERE IS FIERCE FIGHTING.

   YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.  WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR.

HAVE AN ACAN-EFE REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE REPORT
READS: THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TODAY UNLEASHED A NEW OFFENSIVE IN
SAN SALVADOR WITH ATTACKS ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND FIERCE CLASHES
WITH THE ARMY IN SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR, WHICH CONTINUE
UP UNTIL MID-MORNING ON 29 NOVEMBER.  THE ACAN-EFE REPORT ADDS: THE
GUERRILLAS' ACTIONS AFFECTED ESCALON, SAN FRANCISCO, AND SAN BENITO
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE RESIDENCES OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND
U.S.  AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ARE LOCATED.

   A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION REPORTED THERE WERE SHOOTOUTS EARLY THIS
MORNING ON LA CAPILLA STREET IN SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE
RESIDENCE OF U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER IS LOCATED.  THE FMLN AND
THE ARMY ARE ALSO FIGHTING IN MEJICANOS AND CIUDAD DELGADO IN NORTHERN
SAN SALVADOR.  THE FMLN IS MAINTAINING POSITIONS ON THE HIGHWAY
LINKING SAN SALVADOR TO THE WESTERN SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FMLN
REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT ITS TROOPS AMBUSHED PATROLS FROM THE ARMED
FORCES ELITE BATTALIONS.  WITNESSES CONFIRMED TO ACAN-EFE THAT THE
FMLN TOOK POSITIONS IN ANTIGUO CUSCATLAN, A TOWN SOUTHEAST OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   THIS HAS BEEN AN ACAN-EFE REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
THE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL
SALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
POOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
RICH.  TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN
FRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S.  DIPLOMATIC
PERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
HAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS
RESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

   U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY.
MARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR
WALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL.
THEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS
WELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE
PENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY
HAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT
JEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S.
PRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS
STAFF.  THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE
AMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE.  IT IS THE U.S.
INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE
SALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES.  THIS
IS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.

   THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE
DICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4
MILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR.
THAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK
THIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO
THIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY
TOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.

   WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES
OF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC
INSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE
INSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK
DIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR
THE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS
WELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR
SECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS
PREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE
CONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,
SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE
TRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO
CHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND
SUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE         
CITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE     
BISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND
CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A
FASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL
SALVADOR.

GAVE ASSURANCES TONIGHT THAT THE SITUATION "HAS BEEN CONTROLLED" IN
THE VICINITY OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, WHERE TODAY ONCE AGAIN
THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY CLASHED.

   NEVERTHELESS, ARMED FORCES SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ SAID ON
A RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK THAT IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD "THE
SITUATION REMAINS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE TERRORISTS HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL
CIVILIANS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF CIVILIANS ARE BEING
HELD HOSTAGE BY GUERRILLAS IN ESCALON, AN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD IN
THE NORTHEN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE CLASHES RESUMED AT DAWN ON 29
NOVEMBER.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TODAY ALSO
ATTACKED THE GENERAL STAFF, A RESIDENCE FOR U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS,
AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE.

   THE REBELS HAVE OCCUPIED SEVERAL MANSIONS FROM WHICH THEY ARE
ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN AN AREA POPULATED BY GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, DIPLOMATS, AND WHERE THE UN OFFICE IN EL SALVADOR IS
LOCATED.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE ARMY HAS BESIEGED THE AREA AND
"EXPECTS TO CONTROL THE SITUATION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS."

   MAJOR CHAVEZ CACERES REASSERTED THE "ARMY'S IRREVOCABLE WILL TO
DEFEND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" IN THAT AREA, WHILE THE SALVADORAN
GREEN CROSS REPORTED THAT IT HAS EVACUATED SEVERAL FAMILIES FROM THE
SECTOR.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 29 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]
[ALEKSEY PAVLOV] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
ANNOUNCED LAST SUNDAY THAT THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR HAS BROKEN
DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA.  ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS
SUBJECT:

   FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS
IS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF
THE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S.
CIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE
THE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING
WEAPONS TO THE [WORD INDISTINCT] REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE UNITED STATES
CERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.

   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN
ORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE
WITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE
CONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS
UNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.

   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH
NICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM
THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,
INCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS
AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT
CONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE
THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS
WHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.

   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE
BREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN
SAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.  IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?  OF COURSE NOT.  MOST
PROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH
A VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK.

   BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE
FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A
SERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE.  HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO
PEACE IN THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.  


DEV-MUC3-0904 (GTE)

   CLANDESTINE, 30 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT]
REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS
MADE OVER AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES FOUND INSIDE
A WRECKED LIGHT AIRCRAFT, THE FMLN EXPRESSES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES
WERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE
ATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY
POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING
THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THE
DAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE
PROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND
AVIATION EQUIPMENT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF
GENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   2.  THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED
CENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF
SOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED INTO THE AREA.  THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET
FOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN
CONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS.

   3.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A
SMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE
ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING:

       A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND
INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE
PERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS
MOVEMENTS;

       B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND,

       C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS
HERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL
POSITION.

   4.  CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED
ON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT
EVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN
WAR.  IN FACT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ESCALATED THE WAR BY SENDING $4
BILLION IN AID TO STRENGTHEN THE ARMY AND PROVIDE IT WITH A POWERFUL
AIR FORCE.

   THE JUSTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT TO THE FMLN,
THUS REFUSING TO ADMIT THE INTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT AND ALSO
KEEPING THE DOORS CLOSED TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS HAS
UNNECESSARILY PROLONGED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SUFFERING AND HAS       
MADE MORE DRAMATIC THEIR LEGITIMATE STRUGGLE FOR A TRUE DEMOCRATIC,
PLURALIST, AND NON-ALIGNED GOVERNMENT.

   BASED ON THE ABOVE, WE REITERATE:

   1.  THAT WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN ALL
TYPES OF WEAPONS TO GUARANTEE OUR DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE
FROM THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MILITARY ESCALATION PROMOTED BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE FIRM SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS AND
PRESENT U.S. GOVERNMENTS.  THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN WEAPONS
FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND TO GUARANTEE THEIR ARRIVAL AT OUR WAR FRONTS
THROUGH ANY MEANS AVAILABLE.

   2.  WE MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL WILLINGNESS TO DE-ESCALATE THE WAR.  WE
BEGIN BY EXPRESSING THAT WE ARE TOTALLY WILLING TO AGREE ON A
CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND TO BEGIN REAL
NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES.

   3.  WE ARE WILLING TO REFRAIN FROM USING THE SURFACE-TO-AIR
MISSILES IF THE AIR FORCE CALLS A COMPLETE HALT TO ITS BOMBINGS,
STRAFING, AND MACHINEGUNNING THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

DEV-MUC3-0905 (GTE)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS A TENSE
CALM, INTERRUPTED BY SPORADIC SHOOTING, IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MANY
FOREIGNERS ARE LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF HEAVY
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS YESTERDAY.

   AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN OFFICE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE AREA OF
FIGHTING, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "ALL THE PERSONNEL ARE FINE AND WE ARE
NOW EVACUATING SOME EMPLOYEES AND FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THE AREA,
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE" THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

   "WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY GUERRILLAS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE IN THE AREA AND
ENTRANCE IS RESTRICTED.  THEY ARE ONLY PERMITTING THE EVACUATION," THE
OFFICIAL SAID OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   A SPOKESMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THIS
MORNING THAT THE ELITE COUNTERINSURGENCY BELLOSO AND ATLACATL
BATTALIONS AND TROOPS WITH ARTILLERY ARE CARRYING OUT A SPECIAL
OPERATION IN ESCALON TO DISLODGE THE REBELS.  THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE
OPERATION WILL INCLUDE ALL OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, HE SAID
HE COULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE "WE ARE STILL
COMPILING INFORMATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ON 29 NOVEMBER
RESUMED ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND MAQUILISHUAT AND THE MIDDLE
CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF JARDIN GUADALUPE, LA CIMA, AND LOMAS DE SAN
FRANCISCO.

   AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF THE
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ARMY SAID IT HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.
HOWEVER, IT ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN
ESCALON AND HAD SEIZED "THE RESIDENTS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 -
1800 GMT) TODAY, 30 NOVEMBER, THEY "WILL UNDERTAKE THE EVACUATION OF
FOREIGN PERSONNEL" IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  THE FMLN SAID THE MEASURE, WHICH IS BEING
HEEDED BY THE FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS, IS TO GUARANTEE THE
LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON.

   VARIOUS SOURCES SAID THE REBELS HAVE LEFT ESCALON, BUT THIS
INFORMATION HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [TEXT] THE
CLANDESTINE AND LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A
DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH THE PURPOSE OF
DISTORTING THE TRUTH REGARDING THE AGGRESSION THESE BANDITS HAVE
LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   VERY FREQUENTLY THEY BROADCAST REPORTS OF UNIMAGINABLE MILITARY
VICTORIES OF THE FMLN.  THEIR LIAR RADIO STATIONS SAY THEY HAVE
OCCUPIED THE MUNICIPALITIES OF SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE,
CIUDAD DELGADO, AND OTHERS, WHICH, DESPITE THE TRAGEDY WE ARE
SUFFERING, MAKES PEOPLE BURST OUT LAUGHING BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS
THESE ARE BIG LIES.  THESE CLAIMS ARE ABSOLUTELY FALSE.  THE RESIDENTS
OF THOSE MUNICIPALITIES ARE GOING TO THEIR JOBS, BUSES ARE OPERATING,
AND EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN A NORMAL MANNER.

   THE LIAR RADIO STATIONS OF THE FMLN THINK THEY CAN CONFUSE THE
PUBLIC OPINION WITH THEIR FALSE INFORMATION.  THESE STATIONS ARE USED
FOR PROPAGANDISTIC AND DISINFORMATION PURPOSES TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF
THE FMLN IS WINNING MILITARY VICTORIES, WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER ATTAINED
AND WHICH ARE ONLY IN THE MINDS OF ORTEGA'S PUPPETS, WHO BROADCAST
FROM MANAGUA.

   THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES: WHERE ARE THE COWARDLY TERRORIST
AND MURDEROUS CHIEFS OF THE FMLN, SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS,
AND OTHER COWARDS, WHO ARE IN MANAGUA ENJOYING A LUXURIOUS LIFE AND
GOOD FOOD?

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE VICTORIOUS ACTIONS OF
OUR ARMED FORCES, WHO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GENOCIDAL AND
TERRORIST FMLN OFFENSIVE HAVE FACED THE AGGRESSIVE MERCENARIES BY
REDUCING THEM TO SMALL TERRORIST GROUPS, WHICH ARE LOST AND ARE
IRRATIONALLY ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   THE FMLN HAS RIDICULOUSLY CLAIMED TO COMPLETELY CONTROL CERTAIN
MUNICIPALITIES.  ALL OF THESE LIES SHOW THAT THE MURDEROUS FMLN
LEADERS DO NOT HAVE ANY ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH TO CONCEAL THEIR
UNSUCCESSFUL REBEL OFFENSIVE.

   THEIR GREATEST FAILURE HAS BEEN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S REJECTION
OF THE REBEL ACTIONS.  DESPITE SO MANY THREATS MADE BY THE FMLN
TERRORISTS, OUR PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED THEM, LET ALONE AGREED TO
ACCEPT THE WEAPONS THAT THE FMLN WERE OFFERING THEM IF THEY JOINED THE
REBELLION.  THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED
WITH THE WEAPONS THAT DICTATOR ORTEGA HAS GIVEN TO THE FMLN PUPPETS,
HAS FAILED, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECT THE NATIONS OF THE FREE
WORLD TO CONDEMN THIS GENOCIDAL AGGRESSION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 1 DEC 89 (PRAVDA) -- [COMMENTARY] [PAVEL BOGOMOLOV]
[TEXT] JUDGING BY NEWS AGENCY REPORTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS IN EL
SALVADOR HAS REACHED AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS POINT.  PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI'S REFUSAL TO RESPOND TO THE INSURGENTS' RECENT CEASE- FIRE
PROPOSAL HAS RESULTED IN A FRESH OUTBREAK OF BLOODSHED.

   HAVING REJECTED OUT OF HAND LAST WEEK THE VERY IDEA OF THE
RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI LIBERATION MOVEMENT, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SECRET OF ITS INTENTION OF QUICKLY DRIVING THE
GUERRILLAS BACK INTO THE MOUNTAINS USING U.S. MILITARY SUPPLIES.
"ELITE" ARMY BATTALIONS HAD ALREADY PREPARED FOR PUNITIVE ASSAULTS.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?  THE REGIME'S GAMBLE ON MILITARY FORCE PROVED
FUTILE.  THE INSURGENTS REGROUPED THEIR FORCES, BROUGHT UP RESERVES,
AND STRUCK A POWERFUL NEW BLOW.

   THE SALVADORAN DRAMA IS INCREASINGLY SHARPLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE.  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, THE EEC, THE VATICAN, FRANCE, AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW STRESSING THE ACUTE NEED TO
URGE THE WARRING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
BASED ON MUTUAL COMPROMISE.  AND IT IS A VERY GREAT PITY THAT SUCH AN
APPEAL HAS NOT COME FROM THAT CAPITAL WHICH THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES
HEED ABOVE ALL OTHERS -- WASHINGTON.

   ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE URGENT EVACUATION OF U.S. CITIZENS FROM
EL SALVADOR THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.  I RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE
CONDITIONS OF AN ARMED CONFLICT THIS IS A NECESSARY STEP.  BUT IT IS
NO SECRET THAT IN THE RECENT PAST SUCH ACTIONS BY THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION WERE AN OMINOUS SYMPTOM OF THE PREPARATION OF OVERTLY
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS.

   END THE BLOODSHED -- THAT IS THE PRIORITY TASK TODAY.  AND THE
RESTORATION OF THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS
THAT WAS BROKEN OFF SHOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THAT.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST LEADERS WHO FOR
YEARS HAVE KEPT THEIR GENERAL COMMAND POST IN MANAGUA, WITH ORTEGA'S
SUPPORT AND PROTECTION.  WHEN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT
ORTEGA HAD SUPPLIED ARMS TO THE FMLN, WHICH WERE SECRETLY INTENDED FOR
THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE SANDINIST ARMY -- AS WAS THE CASE OF THE
SAM-7 MISSILES -- THEY ORDERED HIM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE FMLN
TERRORISTS BECAUSE THIS IS ENDANGERING USSR AND U.S. RAPPROCHEMENT
POLICIES.  THE KREMLIN HAS REACTED WITH NOTICEABLE ANNOYANCE FOLLOWING
FIDEL CASTRO AND DANIEL ORTEGA'S DIRECT MEDDLING, WHICH IS CAUSING
SERIOUS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID NOT AGREE ON SUPPORTING THE FMLN
TERRORIST UPSURGE.

   THE EXPULSION ORDER FOR JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS,
AND OTHER FMLN LEADERS IS EXPECTED ANY MOMENT NOW.  THIS WILL
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FMLN'S POLITICAL CLOUT.  AT THE SUMMIT
MEETING BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND U.S. PRESIDENTS, CASTRO AND ORTEGA'S
AGGRESSION, USING THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WILL BE
REVIEWED FOLLOWING PRESIDENT ARIAS OF COSTA RICA'S INITIATIVE.

THE NEXT FEW HOURS AFTER BEING DECLARED "PERSONA NON GRATA" FOR
ALLEGEDLY COLLABORATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   LEIVA TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS
HAVE BEEN REMANDED TO THE COURTS, CHARGED WITH ARMS POSSESSION OR FOR
TAKING PART IN ARMED ACTIONS IN COMPLICITY WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN). LEIVA SAID THAT THE SEVEN DEPORTEES
WILL BE "PERMANENTLY" BANNED SO THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO EL
SALVADOR.

   AMONG THE DEPORTED ARE U.S. CITIZENS, DUTCH, GERMANS, AND JAPANESE,
ADDED LEIVA. THE SALVADORAN OFFICIAL DID NOT RELEASE THE NAMES OF THE
DEPORTEES OR THE FOREIGNERS WHO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN THE
NEXT FEW HOURS.

   JENNIFER CASOLO, A U.S. CITIZEN, WAS ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY CORPS
AND ACCUSED OF "ARMS POSSESSION."  GRABRIELA TORNAGO, AN ITALIAN, WAS
ARRESTED AND ACCUSED OF "FINANCING, RECRUITING, AND BEING INVOLVED
WITH TERRORIST GROUPS."

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, CASOLA WAS ARRESTED AT DAYBREAK ON
26 NOVEMBER AT A HOUSE LOCATED IN THE "MIRAVALLE" NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE
THE ARMY CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND A GREAT AMOUNT OF WEAPONS.  TORNAGO WAS
ARRESTED MORE THAN A WEEK AGO IN THE "PRADOS DE VENECIA" NEIGHBORHOOD.
POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT THE ITALIAN WAS PREPARING A FAKE WEDDING AT
HER RESIDENCE TO GATHER PEOPLE LINKED WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ON 11
NOVEMBER STARTED AN ALLEGED "INSURRECTION."

   LEIVA ASSURED THAT THE FOREIGNERS WHO ARE LINKED TO THE GUERRILLAS
WILL BE REMANDED TO THE COURTS BY THE SECURITY FORCE THAT MAKES THE
ARREST.

VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE CRIMES BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT THE
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BE PUNISHED.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAS TELEPHONED
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH

EVIDENCE POINTS IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORS OF THE CRIMES
COMMITTED ON 16 NOVEMBER, "WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SIDES IN THIS ISSUE,
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE."

   CONCERNING THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, PEREZ POINTED OUT
THAT THIS ACTION IS ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE NEUTRALITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, THE SPANISH STAND IS ONE OF
COOPERATION SO THAT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING THE AID AS LONG AS IT IS UNCLEAR
HOW SERIOUS THE CONFLICTING PARTIES ARE ABOUT REACHING AN AGREEMENT.

DAYS OF STRONG REBEL ATTACKS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF 10 YEARS OF WAR.

   ARMY SPOKESMAN MAJOR MAURICIO CHAVEZ CACERES SAID THAT "FOLLOWING
THE FAILURE OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR
OVER A YEAR, WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THEM (THE REBELS) IS ATTACKS ON
PROMINENT PEOPLE AND ON THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ACTIONS TO
SCARE THE POPULATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] RENEWED ITS
ATTACKS EARLY ON 29 NOVEMBER WHEN IT ATTACKED THE COUNTRY'S MOST
IMPORTANT MILITARY INSTALLATION AND SET FIRE TO A RESIDENCE OF U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS AND CONFRONTED THE ARMY IN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS
IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.

   FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO DIED ON 28 NOVEMBER WHEN HE WAS
STRAFFED BY GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO MILITARY SOURCES.  THIS TOOK
PLACE HOURS BEFORE THE RENEWED FIGHTING WHICH PRODUCED 40 CASUALTIES
AMONG GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS.

   IN AN OFFICIAL RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST, CHAVEZ CACERES TODAY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF DESTROYING SOME RESIDENCES IN THE EXCLUSIVE
ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD WITH DYNAMITE, IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR, AND OF
FIRING ON PRIVATE VEHICLES IN HIGH- AND MIDDLE-CLASS SAN SALVADOR
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID: "THEY (THE REBELS) HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO DEAL A MILITARY BLOW; THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT UP A FIGHT
WITH A SINGLE ARMY BATTALION OR COMPANY."

   THE FMLN GUERRILLAS TODAY VACATED THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
HOLDING, FOR OVER 24 HOURS, SEVERAL HOUSES THERE, FROM WHICH THEY
CONFRONTED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

   THE FMLN ANNOUNCED A TRUCE FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 TO 1800 GMT)
TODAY TO EVACUATE FOREIGNERS, DIPLOMATS, AND CIVILIAN RESIDENTS FROM
ESCALON.

   OVER 200 U.S. CITIZENS LEFT TODAY FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF
THE FIGHTING, PARTICULARLY IN ESCALON, A RESIDENTIAL AREA IN WHICH
DIPLOMATS, HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND POWERFUL BUSINESSMEN
LIVE.

   SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER,
APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN
THE FIGHTING BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND REBELS, WHICH HAS ALSO RESULTED IN
SEVERE ECONOMIC LOSSES.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 1 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] DOMINICAN ORDER
SUPERIOR JUAN CARLOS FERNANDEZ CID REPORTED IN MANAGUA TODAY THAT A SPANISH
PRIEST AND FOUR WORKERS OF THE DOMINICAN ORDER -- THREE SALVADORANS AND ONE
U.S. CITIZEN -- WERE ARRESTED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 30 NOVEMBER.

   THE DOMINICAN SUPERIOR TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THE SPANISH PRIEST CARLOS
DIEZ ROJO; SALVADORANS JOSE SANTANA, THE DRIVER; ESTELA CRUZ
BUSTAMANTE, DIRECTOR OF THE ORDER'S CHILD CARE CENTER; AND SANTIAGO DE
JESUS VASQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE "22 APRIL" NEIGHBORHOOD CHOIR; AS WELL
AS A U.S. VOLUNTEER CALLED SCOTT, WERE STILL UNDER ARREST IN SAN
SALVADOR TODAY.

   HE STATED THAT HE HAD CONTACTED SPANISH EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN SAN
SALVADOR THIS MORNING, AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE SAN SALVADOR
TREASURY POLICE HAD ARRESTED THE PRIEST DIEZ ROJO AND THE FOUR
WORKERS.

   ACCORDING TO FERNANDEZ CID, A GROUP OF POLICEMEN RAIDED THE PARISH
CENTER IN CIUDAD CREDISA, A SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ARRESTED
THE FIVE PERSONS AFTER CONDUCTING A SEARCH.

   THE PRIEST WAS VISITING SAN SALVADOR AND HAD ARRIVED IN THE CITY 2
DAYS BEFORE THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   A SPANISH EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN SAN SALVADOR IS PRESENTLY MAKING
EFFORTS TO VISIT CARLOS DIEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS ARRESTED, IN THE
PRESENCE OF SALVADORAN OFFICIALS.

   WITHOUT ANY OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS, TWO PRIESTS OF THE DOMINICAN
ORDER -- SPANISH CITIZEN MIGUEL ANDUEZ AND THE U.S. CITIZEN JAIME
BARNEE -- WERE EXPELLED FROM EL SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO.

   ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS -- FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE
SALVADORAN -- AND TWO WOMEN WERE MURDERED BY 30 MEN IN UNIFORMS WHO
WERE HEAVILY ARMED.

[ALEJANDRO CUBILLAS] [TEXT] SALVADORAN ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURICIO
EDUARDO COLORADO HAS SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL
STAFF WILL BE SUMMONED TO TESTIFY IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUIT
PRIESTS.  THE SALVADORAN OFFICIAL SAID THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE
MUST SAY WHAT MILITARY UNIT OF THE SECURITY CORPS WAS GUARDING THE
AREA AROUND THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] THE DAY THE CRIME
WAS COMMITTED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COLORADO] AT THIS TIME WE CONSIDER IT NECESSARY
FOR US TO SUMMON COL PONCE AND FOR HIM TO TELL US THE NAME OF THE
PERSON, SECURITY CORPS, OR HEADQUARTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PATROLLING THE
AREA WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED.  ONCE WE KNOW WHO WAS IN THE AREA,
WE WILL ALSO SUMMON THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. [END RECORDING]

   MEANWHILE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE
PENAL AND PENAL PROCEDURAL CODES APPROVED LAST WEEK BY THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE LEGAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COLORADO] THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS
FULFILLING ITS HISTORIC TASK AT THIS MOMENT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE.
THE SALVADORAN SOLDIER WHO GIVES HIS LIFE FOR FREEDOM IS FULFILLING
HIS MISSION AND THE LEGALLY APPOINTED AUTHORITIES ARE FULFILLING THEIR
MISSION.  [END RECORDING]

   ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AT SUCH TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY
CREATED BY THE INCREASE IN VIOLENCE, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST REMAIN
CALM AND NOT LOSE HOPE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN NATIONAL COMMUNICATION SECRETARIAT] [TEXT] FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GUERRILLAS FIRED A SAM-7 MISSILE ON
29 NOVEMBER FROM ZACATECOLUCA AND ON 30 NOVEMBER FIRED A SIMILAR
MISSILE, ALSO FROM ZACATECOLUCA.  BOTH MISSED THEIR TARGETS.

   THE AIR FORCES OFFICERS INVOLVED REPORTED THAT IN BOTH CASES THE
SAM-7 MISSILES WERE DETECTED BY OBSERVER PLANES, WHICH IN TURN WARNED
THE TWO SALVADORAN AIR FORCE A-37 PLANES THAT THE MISSILES WERE HEADED
TOWARD THEM.  THE TWO PLANES WERE FLYING PATROL MISSIONS IN THE
ZACATECOLUCA AREA.  BOTH SAM-7 MISSILES FAILED TO STRIKE THEIR TARGETS
THANKS TO THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PILOTS, WHO MANEUVERED TO PREVENT
THE FMLN MISSILES FROM HITTING THEM.

   THE FMLN CONTINUES TO RECEIVE SOVIET ARMS SUPPLIES THROUGH CUBA AND
NICARAGUA, AN ACTION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY DENOUNCED TO
THE ENTIRE WORLD AND WHICH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE FULLY REPUDIATE.  THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPLIED THE FMLN TERRORISTS WITH THIS TYPE
OF SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY OF SOVIET MANUFACTURE, WHICH CONFIRMS THAT
THE FMLN, APART FROM HAVING ITS GENERAL COMMAND INSIDE NICARAGUAN
TERRITORY, HAS THE MILITARY SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE OF THE SANDINIST
REGIME.  OFFICIAL SOURCES BELIEVE THAT THE SAM-7 MISSILES FIRED BY THE
FMLN AGAINST THE AIR FORCE PLANES COULD BE AMONG THE WEAPONS THAT WERE
ONBOARD THE OTHER SMALL PLANE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE BY THE TERRORISTS
AFTER THEY HAD UNLOADED IT.

   AS SOON AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT LEARNED OF THE SAM-7 SHIPMENTS
TO THE FMLN, THEY REPORTED IT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IN
RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT, THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, SHOWING GREAT
ANNOYANCE, ORDERED A FREEZE ON ALL ARMS SHIPMENTS TO THE ORTEGA
GOVERNMENT, WHICH, FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM FIDEL CASTRO, SUPPLIES
MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED
THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY ON THE PARTICIPATION OF MERCENARIES
FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE FMLN, CAUSING
THE GENOCIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   MADRID (SPAIN), 1 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS ACCUSED BY
EL SALVADOR AT THE [UNITED NATIONS] SECURITY COUNCIL ON 30 NOVEMBER OF
WORSENING THE TENSION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS ASKED THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO
ISSUE A CALL FOR AN "IMMEDIATE" CEASE-FIRE AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS.

   ALEJANDRO SERRANO CALDERA, NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE COUNCIL ASK UN SECRETARY GENERAL
JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR "TO UNDERTAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE AND
SUPERVISE" A CEASE-FIRE IN EL SALVADOR.

   WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE DRAFT RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY NICARAGUA AND
RELEASED TODAY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT SUSPENDED ITS MEETING,
WHICH HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY EL SALVADOR TO REPORT NICARAGUAN SHIPMENTS
OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, TO THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS.

   IN THE DRAFT RESOLUTION, NICARAGUA ASKED THE COUNCIL TO
"VIGOROUSLY" CONDEMN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS "BY A
GROUP WEARING UNIFORMS" AS WELL AS "OTHER INDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF
VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY BOMBINGS" BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DURING
THE OFFENSIVE BEGUN BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   IT ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO WORK FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE IN EL
SALVADOR AND FOR THE RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN AS "THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE" THE SALVADORAN CRISIS AND AS
AN "UNPOSTPONABLE STEP" TO CONSOLIDATE THE REGIONAL PEACE PROCESS.

   THE DRAFT RESOLUTION REITERATED THE COUNCIL'S SUPPORT FOR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE AGREEMENTS AND, IN CLEAR REFERENCE TO THE
UNITED STATES, IT URGED THE COUNTRIES WITH LINKS OR INTERESTS IN THE
REGION NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   ACCORDING TO NICARAGUA, THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD ALSO EXPRESS
ITS SATISFACTION WITH THE FORTHCOMING DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA].

   THE FIRST GROUP FROM ONUCA IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE ON SUNDAY IN
TEGUCIGALPA, WHERE ITS HEADQUARTERS WILL BE LOCATED.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN REBELS HAVE FIRED TWO
SOVIET - MADE SURFACE - TO - AIR MISSILES SINCE THEY STARTED THEIR
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE MISSILES, WHICH
"MISSED," WERE FIRED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] IN ZACATECOLUCA, IN THE REGION'S CENTER, WHERE CLASHES BETWEEN
THE ARMY AND THE REBELS CONTINUED TODAY.

   CRISTIANI ADMITTED HE IS CONCERNED OVER "THE FMLN'S PLANS FOR
STRICTLY TERRORIST ACTIONS," SUCH AS "KILLING PERSONALITIES,
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND RELATIVES OF ARMED FORCES OFFICERS."

   HE ALSO SAID HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REQUESTED ANY INTERNATIONAL
MILITARY AID BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES "CAN COUNTERACT THE FMLN
ATTACKS" AND BECAUSE "THE GUERRILLA THREAT OF TAKING POWER IN THE
COUNTRY BY FORCE IS NOT REAL."

   CRISTIANI ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS ONLY
"IF HOSTILITIES CEASE."  HE ASSERTED THAT THE FMLN ACTIONS "ARE LINKED
TO DOMESTIC EVENTS IN NICARAGUA AND CUBA."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS "COMPLETELY SURE THE ARMED FORCES CAN
CONTROL THE SITUATION BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS ARE UNABLE TO SEIZE POWER
BY FORCE AND DO NOT HAVE EVEN THE LEAST SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   CRISTIANI POINTED OUT: "WE CANNOT GIVE THE FMLN ANY CHANCES BECAUSE
IT IS A MINORITY ARMED GROUP AIDED BY NICARAGUA AND CUBA, A GROUP
WHUICH INTENDS TO SEIZE SOMETHING THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO."

   "IF THE GUERRILLAS WANT TO DIALOGUE, LET THEM STOP THEIR ARMED
ACTIONS. IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WANT
PEACE," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT "THE COFFEE, SUGAR, AND COTTON CROPS," THE
COUNTRY'S MAIN EXPORT PRODUCTS, "WILL BE HARVESTED WITH ARMY
RESERVISTS."

   THE GOVERNMENT HEADED BY CRISTIANI, WHICH TODAY COMPLETED 6 MONTHS,
HAS ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN ECONOMIC LOSSES RESULTING
FROM THE BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE REBELS SINCE 11
NOVEMBER.

PONCE HAS SAID THAT IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE USE OF MISSILES BY
THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE IS TAKING PRECAUTIONS AND HAS CHANGED ITS FLIGHT TACTICS OR ADOPTED
NEW ONES.

   "THE ARMED FORCES IS DETERMINED TO CONFRONT THEM, AND TO ACHIEVE
THEIR GOAL THE REBELS WILL HAVE TO STEP OVER THE BODIES OF EVERY
SINGLE SOLDIER," COL PONCE SAID.

   COL PONCE ALSO SAID THAT THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN
CASOLO, WHO WAS COVERING UP AN FMLN SAFEHOUSE, IS A HARD BLOW TO THE
TERRORISTS BECAUSE CASOLO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING CONGRESSIONAL
STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CHURCHES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INTO THE
COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE APPARENTLY CAME TO THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE
HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE DISPLACED.

   PONCE ALSO SAID THAT MANY INTERNATIONALISTS JOIN THE TERRORIST
GROUPS, THUS VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  PONCE
SAID THAT THE LEADERS OF THE FRONT GROUPS DEFINED THEIR POSITIONS WHEN
THEY JOINED THE FMLN TO CARRY OUT THE SO-CALLED FINAL OFFENSIVE, WHICH
HAS PROVEN TO BE A TOTAL FAILURE BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN DEMOCRACY AND NOT COMMUNISM.

   THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF ALSO MET WITH FOREIGN
CORRESPONDENTS. HE SAID THAT THE FMLN CURRENTLY HAS THE SUPPORT OF
ONLY NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND RUSSIA [AS PUBLISHED ], BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE
THE ESSENTIAL SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THEREFORE, THYE ARE
DOOMED TO POLITICAL-MILITARY FAILURE.  ALL THE FMLN HAS LEFT IS ITS
PROPAGANDA TACTICS AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

   COL PONCE TALKED ABOUT THE CASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE FMLN
TERRORISTS THROUGH 0600 [1200 GMT] ON 28 NOVEMBER.  PONCE SAID THAT
1,680 REBELS HAD BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT NUMBER WOUNDED.
COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE ARMY REGRETS THE HEROIC DEATHS OF 398
SOLDIERS AND APPROXIMATELY 800 WOUNDED IN CLASHES SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL
GUARD HAS CAPTURED THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS ACCOMPLICES AND
HARBORERS, IN THE CASE OF THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF ON 30 OCTOBER.

   THE NATIONAL GUARD REPORTED THAT IT ARRESTED 15 PEOPLE LAST WEEK AT
VARIOUS PLACES IN HERE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER PERSONS AT THE
OFFICES OF THE SO-CALLED AWARENESS FOR SPIRITUAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY
OF MAN [CONCIENTIZACION PARA RECUPERACION ESPIRITUAL Y ECONOMICA DEL
HOMBRE, CREDHO], AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH ON 63 SOUTH AVENUE AND
OLIMPICA AVENUE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SEVERAL PERSONS WHO WERE HELD
HOSTAGE THERE ON 30 OCTOBER LATER APPEARED AT THE CENTRAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE ABUSE.

   WHEN NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL BEGAN THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION
THAT SAME DAY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ARRESTED PERSONS HAD
COMMITTED OTHER ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS AND AGAINST THE
COUNTRY'S SECURITY.  AFTER DETERMINING THAT THIS EPISCOPAL CHURCH WAS
VISITED BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THAT IT
HARBORED A GROUP THAT IS AN FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] FRONT, THE PLACE WAS SEARCH AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT,
IN ADDITION TO THE CHURCH, OFFICES OF CREDHO ALSO OPERATED THERE --
CREDHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF AN ORGANIZATION THEY CALL DIACOMIAS; THAT
60 PERSONS ARE EMPLOYED THERE; THAT MOST OF THOSE PERSONS ARE NOT
PARISHIONERS, BUT CREDHO EMPLOYEES; THAT CREDHO'S DIRECTOR IS A PRIEST
OF SPANISH ORIGIN NAMED LUIS SERRANO LORENTE; AND THAT THIS PRIEST IS
NOW A NATURALIZED SALVADORAN.

   THERE THE NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL ARRESTED JOSE HORACIO GUZMAN
RIVAS, JOSE EDUARDO SANCHEZ CASTILLO, LUIS GUSTAVO LOPEZ MAGANA, JOSE
VIDAL ENAMORADO DIAZ, ELBA RUTH ALFARO VALENCIA, ALEX ANTONIO TOVAR
FLORES, JOSE CANDELARIO AGUILAR ALVAREZ, AND RANDOLFO CAMPO BENAVIDES.
IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAME CASE, THEY ALSO ARRESTED JUAN ANTONIO
VERSICO NUNEZ, ANA JULIO RODRIGUEZ, AND JOSE FRANCISCO PASTORANGES
AT VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CIUDAD SATELITE NEIGHBORHOOD.  LATER ON, LUIS
SERRANO LORENTE, PASTOR OF THIS ANGLICAN CHURCH, WAS ARRESTED IN THE
LOMAS VERDES NEIGHBORHOOD.  JULIO CESAR CASTRO RAMIREZ AND JULIO
EUGENIA AGUILERA ESCOBAR WERE LATER ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA, AND,
LASTLY, AIDA MARGARITA GOMEZ DE LEON WAS ARRESTED IN THE DON BOSCO
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA TECLA.

   SERRANO SAID HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREDHO AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
AFOREMENTIONED CHURCH.  HE ASSERTED THAT HE LEARNED ON 29 OCTOBER THAT
IN THE CHURCHYARD TWO TRUCKS WERE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES, WHICH WERE
HURLED THE NEXT DAY AT THE MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFF.  HE DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT THIS, THEREBY
COVERING FOR THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO MURDER HUMBLE WORKING PEOPLE.
SERRANO ALSO SAID THAT CREDHO IS FINANCED BY A FRONT GROUP CALLED
DIACOMIAS, WHICH HAS NO LEGAL STATUS, BUT IS THE CHANNEL FOR AID
THAT IS SENT IN CASH BY SO-CALLED SOLIDARITY CHURCHES AND ASSOCIATIONS
ORGANIZED IN SWEDEN, BRITAIN, NETHERLANDS, CANADA, THE UNITED STATES,
AND AUSTRALIA.  THIS MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED TO LUTHERAN, CATHOLIC,
EMANUEL BAPTIST, AND EPISCOPAL CHURCHES, AS WELL AS TO THE FOUNDATION
FOR PROMOTION OF COOPERATIVES [FUNDACION PROMOTORA DE COOPERATIVAS,
FUNPROCOOP] AND THE FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT
[FEDERACION DE COOPERATIVAS PARA EL DESARROLLO, FEDECOOPADE].  THESE
GROUPS COMPRISE DIACOMIAS AND TWICE A MONTH, ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
EACH GROUP MEETS AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO DISCUSS DISTRIBUTION OF
THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH, HE SAID, IS DELIVERED TO
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THAT ARE DIRECTED BY THE
FMLN FRONT GROUPS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW PATRIOTS, I AM ADDRESSING THE
NATION TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION CONCERNING THE ISSUE
OF EXTRADITION, WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF A VERY INTENSE DEBATE LAST
NIGHT AT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' FIRST COMMISSION.

   A PROPOSAL WAS PUT FORWARD TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY
REFERENDUM SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY -- WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL STAGES -- AN
ADDITIONAL QUESTION BE INCLUDED WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU, THE
COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, WANT COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS TO BE EXTRADITED.

   THIS QUESTION WOULD JOIN FOUR OTHER ISSUES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN
APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION TO POPULAR CONSULTATION ON 21 JANUARY.  ON
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY
EXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL.

   I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS
LLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING
THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE
CURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,
IT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON
EXTRADITION.

   THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED
IF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE
FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON
DEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL.

   INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS
FOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD.  EXTRADITION IS NOT
PUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
NEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO
PORTRAY IT.

   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE
EXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE
CONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING
PUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT
PROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS
IMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY
APPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL
PREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT
COLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED
THROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY
INFORMING THE COUNTERPART.

   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF
CRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN
EXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO
ITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES
OF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO
EXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH
AS DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED
TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH
THE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT
AGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE
CRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID
THAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS
ELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.

   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED
PRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO
EFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE
MINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT
DECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,
AFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL
CARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS
KIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO
LEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] LAST YEAR, WITHOUT
EXTRADITION IN EFFECT, OVER 600 ANONYMOUS COLOMBIAN PEASANTS WERE
MURDERED IN MORE THAN 40 MASSACRES BY HIRED ASSASSINS PAID BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR
ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN
QUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN
EXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS
BROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,
FROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET
US NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY
MURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND
INTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT
EXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE
TRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND
CONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
HOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH
OFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
MURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO
WANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE
BELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS
CAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH
THESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?

   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT
HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW
THAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE
DONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE
SIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT
WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG
TRAFFICKERS' MONEY.

   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT
WOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A
REFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION
ON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE
REFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG
TRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC
OPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND
CONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.

   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED
FREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK
INTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL
INTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST
REFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO
SERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN
IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER
PARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE
WITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT
DRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT
ELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND
MORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT
ALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE
PUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC
THAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE
DANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.

   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL
INVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S
OPENING TO THE PACIFIC.  THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;
WITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH
INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE
GOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE
PICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE

   HAVANA (CUBA), 2 DEC 89 (RADIO RELOJ NETWORK) -- [TEXT] OSCAR ORAMAS, THE
CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS STATED THAT THE ARMS SUPPLIED BY
THE UNITED STATES AND THE HUNDREDS OF U.S. ADVISERS SENT TO EL SALVADOR ARE
THE CAUSE OF THE TERROR THAT SALVADORANS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE FOR MORE THAN 10
YEARS.

   ORAMAS CHARGED THAT THE U.S. ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF
THE TORTURE, MURDERS, AND DISAPPEARANCES THAT HAVE BECOME A DAILY
OCCURRENCE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION.

   ORAMAS ADDED THAT DESPITE THE GREAT EFFORT MADE BY THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION TO CONCEAL ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE
PREVAILING IN EL SALVADOR, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE
DECEIVED AND THE FACTS THAT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT THE
PEOPLES HAVE POINTED THEIR ACCUSING FINGERS AT THE UNITED STATES.

   THE CUBAN DIPLOMAT REBUTTED THE U.S. CHARGES AIMED AT SHIFTING
RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR COUNTRY FOR THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE U.S.
CHARGES WERE TO BE EXPECTED, ORAMAS SAID.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] CENTRAL AMERICAN BISHOPS
ARE "VERY WORRIED" OVER THE SITUATION OF THE CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE IN EL
SALVADOR AND PANAMA, "WHO ARE ENDURING A DIFFICULT TRIAL," ACCORDING TO A
DOCUMENT ISSUED BY THE EPISCOPAL SECRETARIAT OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA
(SEDAC).

   IN THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY 42 AREA BISHOPS, THE BISHOPS "EXPRESS
APPRECIATION FOR THE COURAGEOUS, EVANGELIC, AND PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE OF
THE PANAMANIAN CHURCH, GUIDED BY ITS TRUE CLERGYMEN, IN FACING THE
DOUBLE AGGRESSION THEY ARE ENDURING."

   PANAMA IS ENDURING "EXTERNAL SANCTIONS (IMPOSED BY THE UNITED
STATES) THAT IMPOVERISH THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH THE OPEN DENIAL OF
FUNDAMENTAL GUARANTEES AND RIGHTS TO THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THE
POLICY OF THE CURRENT PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT," THE DOCUMENT ADDS.

   REGARDING EL SALVADOR, "WE ARE HURT" BY THE SUFFERING, DEATH, AND
DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN
ENDURING FOR A DECADE.

   "THE USE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF ARMED
GROUPS, THE INTENSE BOMBINGS OVER DENSELY POPULATED AREAS (BY THE
ARMY), AND THE USE OF THE MEDIA TO STIR UP PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND
INCREASE HATRED AMONG BROTHERS ARE ALL REPULSIVE," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT
STATES.

   THE SEDAC RECALLS THAT AMONG THE WAR VICTIMS ARE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS, WHO, FROM THEIR TEACHING PODIUMS, TRIED TO SHAPE MORAL AND
JUST CONSCIENCES AMONG THE FUTURE BUILDERS OF SOCIETY.  IT ALSO
CONDEMNS THE "BRUTAL WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE MASSACRED, WHICH PROVES
HOW FAR DOWN THE MORAL SENSE AND HUMAN QUALITY OF THOSE WHO
PERPETRATED THE CRIME HAS FALLEN."

   REGARDING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, THE HIGHEST RANKING LEADERS OF
THE CHURCH IN THE AREA POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS
PREVENTING OR HAMPERING EFFORTS TO BUILD A LONG LASTING PEACE.

   AMONG THE FACTORS THE BISHOPS MENTION IS "THE PERSISTENCE OF
SERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS -- HUNGER, UNEMPLOYMENT, THE HIGH COST OF
LIVING, AND THE REALITY OF AN UNDERPRIVILEGED CLASS -- YET MOST RULERS
AND OTHER BODIES HOLDING POWER DO NOT SHOW ANY DESIRE TO ELIMINATE
THESE FACTORS."

   IN ADDITION, THE "CRIMINAL STUBBORNNESS" OF SEARCHING FOR A
MILITARY AND ARMED SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS GENERATED
"THE DEEPLY ROOTED UNJUSTICE IN OUR REALITY, WHICH IS AGGRAVATED BY
THE OUTRAGEOUS MEDDLING OF FOREIGN SUPERPOWERS."

   "THE INTEREST OF A GROUP OR IDEOLOGIES PREVAIL OVER THE NEEDS AND
RIGHTS OF CITIZENS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENTS STATES.  THE HEADS OF THE
CHURCHES OF THE SIX ISTHMIAN COUNTRIES ADD THAT THIS HASTENS THE
"CRIMINAL AND IMMORAL" ARMS BUILDUP, WHICH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
COSTA RICA, HAS LED PEOPLE IN THE AREA INTO INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT
AND A RISE IN THEIR FOREIGN DEBT.

   "THE SMUGGLING OF WEAPONS TO STRENGTHEN SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS OF
VARIOUS TENDENCIES IS NO LESS OUTRAGEOUS AND CRIMINAL THAN THE
EXISTENCE OF DEATH SQUADS OR PARAMILITARY GROUPS," THE SEDAC DOCUMENT
ADDS.

   IT IS WORRYING TO SEE HOW SOME NATIONS IN THE AREA PROMOTE
CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS "AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH"
(PANAMA), OR PROMOTE "ANTITERRORIST" LAWS (EL SALVADOR) THAT CAN BE
USED FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE
ADVERSARIES, THE BISHOPS POINTED OUT.

   TO ALL THESE EVILS ONE MUST ADD THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL, THE
INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE,
AND DEATH.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] NOW THEY ARE STILL DOING THE SAME THING, EXCEPT THAT THE
KILLINGS ARE THOSE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE PLACES BURNED ARE HOMES IN THE
DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE UN HEADQUARTERS, AND THOSE ACCUSED
OF COLLABORATING WITH THE FMLN ARE THE EPISCOPAL CHURCHES.  THE STRATEGY IS
THE SAME.  THE FMLN CONTINUES TO STRIKE AT AND MOCK THE ARMED FORCES.  FAR
FROM DIMINISHING IN NUMBER, IT HAS INCREASED IN NUMBER.  THE PERSECUTION OF
THE CHURCH, THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS, THE PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND, ABOVE
ALL, THE APPARENT DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE SITUATION AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED
FORCES' LEADERSHIP HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.  THE
MILITARY CONTINUES TO BE IN COMMAND, AND CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WAS BUT A
COSTLY MAKEOVER.

   THE U.S. ANALYSTS ARE BEGINNING TO REACT.  AFTER 9 YEARS OF
INVESTING AT ALL LEVELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CAPITAL AND THE PRINCIPAL
CITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH A STRATEGIC SIEGE, WITH THE THEATER OF
OPERATIONS IN THE TROUBLE SPOTS, AND WITHOUT ANY PROSPECT OF
CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN THE HALLS OF
CONGRESS IS A CHANGE OF POLICY AND THE PROMOTION OF NEGOTIATION.  ALL
THE WORLD IS SUFFERING DEEPLY, WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A CHANGE OF POLICY.
WHAT THE U.S. CONGRESS IS STUDYING IS WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE WITH
THAT POLICY WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL, WHICH PROTECTS THE ASSASSINS
OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND FIVE
MORE JESUITS.  IT IS STUDYING WHETHER IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT A FASCIST PARTY AND A CRIMINAL-RIDDEN ARMED FORCES AND THUS
CONDEMN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO CLOSE TO THEIR BORDERS TO TERRIBLE
SUFFERING, OR WHETHER THE TIME OF CHANGE HAS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES.  THE POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR MUST BE CHANGED TO ACHIEVE THE
GOAL OF DEMOCRACY SO THAT PLURALISM WILL GIVE WAY TO DEMOCRACY,
JUSTICE, AND PEACE.  THE UNITED STATES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO IT MUST CHANGE ITS POLICY.

NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORIST CRIMINALS ON THREE OCCASIONS AS THE

MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE LEON BATTALION REPORTED THAT THEY KILLED TWO
TERRORIST CRIMINALS DURING A SKIRMISH IN LAS DELICIAS, SAN MIGUEL
JURISDICTION.  THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE SOLDIERS SEIZED ONE 60 MM
MORTAR, ONE GRENADE OF THE TYPE LAUNCHED WITH CATAPULTS, AND OTHER WAR
SUPPLIES.  THEY ADDED THAT THE TROOPS FOUND 1 M-16 RIFLE, 1,500 ROUNDS
OF AMMUNITION, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES ABANDONED IN EL TULAR

   LA PAZ, 4 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT
RESULTED IN JAIME PAZ ZAMORA'S INSTALLATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC WILL AGAIN TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT WEEKS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE
INSTALLED AS MAYOR OF LA PAZ.

   THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS HELD YESTERDAY DID NOT CLEARLY INDICATE WHO
WILL BE THE MAYOR OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITY, WHERE THE CANDIDATES
OF THE POPULIST NEW POLITICAL GROUPS AND THOSE OF THE TRADITIONAL
PARTIES RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF VOTES.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL RETURNS RELEASED BY THE PRIVATE TELEVISION
CHANNELS, WHICH IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY SIMILAR
TO THOSE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT, CARLOS PALENQUE, 45, A RADIO
AND TELEVISION BUSINESSMAN AND THE LEADER OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE
FATHERLAND (CONDEPA), HAS RECEIVED MOST OF THE VOTES.

   PALENQUE RECEIVED 39.9 PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST IN LA PAZ, THEREBY
GIVING CONDEPA 5 OF THE 13 SEATS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ELECT
THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ ON 2 JANUARY.

   THE ALLIANCE OF THE RIGHT WING NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC ACTION (ADN)
AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) HAS
ALSO WON FIVE TOWN COUNCIL SEATS.

   RONALD MACLEAN, 40 AND OF SCOTTISH ANCESTRY, THE MAYORAL CANDIDATE
OF THE ADN-MIR ALLIANCE, HAS OBTAINED 36.8 PERCENT OF THE VOTES IN LA
PAZ, WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE MAYOR SINCE L985.

   FAR BEHIND WERE THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION'S PARTY, THE NATIONALIST
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), WHICH RECEIVED TWO SEATS, AND THE
POPULIST SOLIDARITY CIVIC UNION (UCS), LED BY BREWERY OWNER MAX
FERNANDEZ, WITH ONE TOWN COUNCIL SEAT.

   THE DECISION AS TO WHO WILL BE THE NEW LA PAZ MAYOR ON 2 JANUARY IS
NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE MNR, BUT ITS LEADERS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON
THEIR POSITION LAST NIGHT.

   GONZALO SANCHEZ DE LOSADA, THE LEADER OF THE MNR, LAST NIGHT SAID
ON TELEVISION: "WE MUST BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS IN SEARCHING FOR A
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, OR THE PEOPLE WILL TURN THEIR BACKS ON
POPULISM."

   HE SAID HIS DECISION WILL BE "A CHRISTMAS PRESENT."  HE INSISTED,
HOWEVER, THAT IN HIS OPINION THE GOVERNING ADN-MIR ALLIANCE "WILL
EASILY FIX THINGS BETWEEN THEM" BECAUSE "THEY ARE TWO OF A KIND."

   ALTHOUGH THE MNR WAS THE PARTY TO RECEIVE MOST OF THE VOTES IN THE
7 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT WAS DUE TO AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN TWO
OLD POLITICAL ENEMIES -- THE ADN AND MIR -- THAT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, WHO
HAD COME THIRD IN THE ELECTIONS, WAS INSTALLED AS PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC. "IF WE APPLIED THIS SAME RULE TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM,"
SANCHEZ DE LOSADA SAID JOKINGLY, "GUIDO CAPRA (MNR CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR
OF LA PAZ) WOULD BE ELECTED."

   SANCHEZ DE LOSADA POINTED OUT THAT PALENQUE WAS ONE OF THE
SUPPORTERS OF THE ADN-MIR GOVERNING ALLIANCE, WHICH PREVENTED SANCHEZ
DE LOSADA FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT.

   ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION, PALENQUE'S PARTY GAINED THE LA PAZ
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (CORDEPAZ) AND "HALF A MINISTRY" (REFERRING TO
THE COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY) AS A RESULT OF THE
ALLIANCE.  SANCHEZ DE LOSADA WARNED THE BOLIVIAN POLITICIANS THAT
PALENQUE'S POPULIST GROUP, WHICH IS GROWING VERY FAST, HAS ITS EYES
SET "ON THE L993 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, NOT ONLY ON THE LA PAZ
MAYORSHIP."

   WHILE RESPECT WAS SHOWN TOWARD RONALD MACLEAN, THE CANDIDATE MOST
CRITICIZED BY THE MNR DURING THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN WAS
PALENQUE.

   PALENQUE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNCILMEN WHO ON 2 JANUARY WILL
ELECT THE NEXT MAYOR OF LA PAZ MUST "RESPECT THE WILL OF THE
MAJORITY."

   "WE HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATION (AMONG PARTIES) AND THAT
THE DESIRE OF THE MAJORITY WILL BE RESPECTED," PALENQUE STATED.  HE IS
WELL KNOWN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE BEARD HE WEARS, WHICH MAKES HIM
LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

   PALENQUE, WHO IS CERTAIN OF THE SUPPORT HE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE
ONLY UCS COUNCILMAN IN LA PAZ, FEARS THAT A PACT BETWEEN THE ADN-MIR
COALITION AND THE MNR WILL PREVENT HIM FROM OBTAINING THE MAYORSHIP OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY.

   SUCH AN ALLIANCE, HOWEVER, WITH A GREATER IDEOLOGICAL BASIS THAN
ANY OTHER, WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE GRUDGE THAT THE MNR BEARS BECAUSE
THE ADN AND THE MIR "HAD STOLEN FROM IT" THE PRESIDENCY OF THE
REPUBLIC DURING THE LAST ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS.

   "WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
MOTIVATED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS OR BY ANY VENGEANCE," SANCHEZ DE
LOSADA STATED, COMMENTING ON THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TO
DESIGNATE THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ.

   LIKE IN LA PAZ, THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
SUPPORT IN THE OTHER MAJOR BOLIVIAN CITIES, WHERE THE COALITION CAME
IN FIRST BUT FAILED TO WIN ABSOLUTE MAJORITIES.

   THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS SUCRE, WHERE THE CANDIDATE OF THE UNITED LEFT
COALITION, RADIO REPORTER OMAR MONTALVO, OBTAINED 57.3 PERCENT OF THE
VOTES, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE MAYORSHIP.

   THE MOST OUTSTANDING POINTS ABOUT THE ELECTIONS WERE THE ABSTENTION
OF BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS AND THE ALMOST ABSOLUTE
NORMALCY DURING THE ELECTIONS.

   THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON 15 NOVEMBER
DUE TO STREET CONFRONTATIONS CAUSED BY SOCIAL DISTURBANCES DID NOT
HAMPER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   THE TRADITIONAL RESTRICTIONS, HOWEVER, AFFECTED TRAFFIC AND
HAMPERED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, KEEPING VOTERS FROM CASTING THEIR
VOTES. THE ABSTENTION WAS ALSO CAUSED BY THE WEARINESS OF THE VOTERS,
WHO ARE VOTING FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN 4 YEARS.

   LIMA, 28 NOV 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] DELEGATES TO A LATIN AMERICAN
CONGRESS THAT IS BEING HELD IN LIMA ON MISSING DETAINEES IN LATIN
AMERICA TODAY EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
DETAINEES AND MISSING PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE COUNTRIES THAT
HAVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS.

   "WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
DISAPPEARANCES.  THESE GROUPS ARE ORGANIZED BY THE STATE ITSELF TO GET
RID OF ITS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND THESE GROUPS ARE EQUIPPED WITH ALL
THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN ACTS OF IMPUNITY," SAID THE
CONGRESS SPOKESPERSON.

   ABOUT 200 DELEGATES FROM 12 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND FROM
EUROPEAN AND U.S. HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE
IX CONGRESS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ASSOCIATIONS OF
RELATIVES OF MISSING DETAINEES THAT BEGAN TODAY AND WILL END ON 30
NOVEMBER IN LIMA.

   SOLA SIERRA, A MEMBER OF THE FEDERATION, HAS TOLD EFE THAT "THE ON
THE ESCALATION OF THESE PRACTICES, AND ON THE IMPUNITY PREVAILING IN
ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THIS METHOD OF REPRESSION PREVAILS."

   SIERRA, A CHILEAN CITIZEN, SAID THAT THIS YEAR THE COUNTRIES WITH
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES ARE COLOMBIA, EL SALVADOR,
GUATEMALA, AND PERU, "WHERE POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED."
HOWEVER, SHE FAILED TO MENTION THE NUMBER OF MISSING DETAINEES.

   SIERRA, THE CHILEAN DELEGATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILEAN
ASSOCIATION OF RELATIVES OF MISSING PEOPLE, SAID THAT THERE IS NO
TOTAL NUMBER OF MISSING PEOPLE, BUT THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN REPORTED MISSING THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA SINCE 1981.

   "THIS FIGURE HAS INCREASED AT A FRIGHTENING RATE, AND WE REGRET
THAT THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN COUNTRIES WITH
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS," SHE ADDED.

   SHE SAID THAT "NEITHER UNDER A DICTATORSHIP NOR UNDER A DEMOCRACY"
HAS THE PROBLEM OF THE MISSING DETAINEES BEEN RESOLVED BECAUSE THE
GOVERNMENT "ALWAYS MANAGE TO TALK ITS WAY OUT OF INVESTIGATING OR
PUNISHING.

   "(THE GOVERNMENTS) ARGUE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO FORGET THE PAST IN
ORDER TO BUILD THE PRESENT AND THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE IF
PEACE IS TO PREVAIL.  BUT HOW CAN THERE BE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION
WHILE EXTREMELY SERIOUS EVENTS LIKE THE MASSIVE KILLING OF HUMAN
BEINGS CONTINUE," SHE ADDED.

   SIERRA REGRETTED THAT "THERE IS VERY STRONG PRESS CENSORSHIP, AND,
WHAT IS WORSE, A SELF-IMPOSED CENSORSHIP [AUTOCENSURA]" IN THE
COUNTRIES WHERE MOST MISSING DETAINEES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

   THESE SITUATIONS ALWAYS LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE STATE
THAT PROMOTES THIS ENTIRE POLICY, THAT IS TO SAY, THE USE OF STATE
TERRORISM IN COUNTRIES WHERE A STATE OF LAW, COURTS, AND ESTABLISHED
LEGAL PRACTICES PREVAIL, SIERRA COMMENTED.

   IN TODAY'S SESSION, A MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT
OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS AT LEAST 4,000 PEOPLE, MOSTLY PEASANTS AND
ANDEAN COMMUNITY LEADERS, WHO WERE "ARRESTED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
WHO LATER DENIED IT," HAVE DISAPPEARED.

   THE MEMBER OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION SAID THAT, ACCORDING TO
OFFICIAL FIGURES, ABOUT 15,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AS A RESULT OF
POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU, AND THAT A "NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER" HAS BEEN
KILLED IN CLASHES.

11 NOVEMBER HAS INFLICTED 4,834 CASUALTIES ON THE SALVADORAN TROOPS AND
GUERRILLAS, ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED TODAY BY THE GOVERNMENT ARMED
FORCES.

   THE REPORT NOTES THAT, IN THE LAST 24 DAYS, 1,853 FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS AND 457 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN
KILLED, WHILE 1,183 REBELS AND 1,341 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE MILITARY REPORT ADDS, THE ARMY SEIZED 900
RIFLES OF VARIOUS TYPES AND CALIBERS, INCLUDING 300 AK-47'S AND
DRAGONOVS, 140 GRENADE LAUNCHERS, AND ABUNDANT MATERIAL TO MAKE
EXPLOSIVES.

   MILITARY SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT FMLN GROUPS CLASHED WITH ARMY
TROOPS NEAR ZACATECOLUCA, A DEPARTMENT CAPITAL LOCATED 54 KM SOUTH OF
SAN SALVADOR.  THEY SAID THAT THE CLASHES LASTED SEVERAL HOURS AND
THAT THE AIR FORCE MOVED IN TO ROUT OUT THE GUERRILLAS.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN CLAIMED CREDIT THROUGH ITS CLANDESTINE RADIO
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF AN ARMORED VEHICLE IN EL PUENTE JURISDICTION OF
SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER,
THIS REPORT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [EXCERPTS] SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TONIGHT CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE
SPECIAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA ON 10-11
DECEMBER.  CRISTIANI SAID OVER RADIO AND TELEVISION THAT HE WILL
ATTEND THE SUMMIT "IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE" AND TO TELL
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT "UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS HIS
SENDING THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) PUPPETS
TO KILL SALVADORANS JUSTIFIED."

   CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT EL SALVADOR "HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO
FIND A SOLUTION THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS" BUT IN ALLUSION TO NICARAGUA,
HE ADDED THAT "THOSE WHO SEEK TO SIGN COMMITMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE
PRESIDENTS SHOULD ALSO FULFILL THEM."

   MEANWHILE, HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA SAID TODAY IN TEGUCIGALPA
THAT HE WAS WILLING TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT.  HOWEVER, COSTA RICAN
FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL SAID IN HIS COUNTRY THAT EL SALVADOR
AND HONDURAS HAD NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED THEIR ATTENDANCE.

   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, HE WILL CONFIRM HIS ATTENDANCE ON 5
DECEMBER.

   MADRIGAL PREDICTED THAT THE SUMMIT "WILL NOT BE EASY" DUE TO THE
TOPICS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AND BECAUSE THE AGENDA WILL SURELY
INCLUDE THE ALLEGED NICARAGUAN ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AS REQUESTED BY NICARAGUA.

   HOWEVER, THE AGENDA IS BEING PROCESSED AND ALTHOUGH COSTA RICA
OFFERED TO HOST THE MEETING, "IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN FORCING THE
ISSUE," HE EMPHASIZED.

   MADRIGAL ADDED THAT WHAT INTERESTS COSTA RICA IS TO SERVE AS A
"BRIDGE" FOR SOLVING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR,
AND FINDING SOME FORMULA SO THAT THE SALVADORAN AND NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENTS WILL ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS.

   HE ADDED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE FIVE
COUNTRIES WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE ON THE EVE OF THE LONG-AWAITED MEETING
TO PREPARE FOR IT.

   THE COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER REPORTED THAT THEY ARE ALSO
CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF INVITING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM OTHER
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN
OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA (ONUCA).

   SAN SALVADOR, 5 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GUERRILLA FORCES AND THE ARMY TODAY AGAIN SHOOK THE
NORTHWEST SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, AFTER A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COLUMN RAIDED THE TOWN OF SAN ANTONIO ABAD.

   AT LEAST FIVE MILITARY AND REBEL DEATHS, THREE STORES PARTIALLY
DESTROYED, AND ONE ELECTRIC POLE BLOWN UP ARE THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS
OF THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, BETWEEN 2100 ON 4 DECEMBER AND
0200 5 DECEMBER.

   THE FMLN GUERRILLA FORCES TODAY ALSO ATTACKED ARMY POSITIONS IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, A WORKERS' NEIGHBORHOOD NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND LA
CIMA NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE CLASHES WERE
STILL UNDERWAY AT MID-MORNING.

   THE ARMY ADMITTED THAT ONE SOLDIER DIED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED
DURING THE CLASHES IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD, A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
LOCATED BESIDE THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA; AND AT LEAST FOUR REBELS
WERE RIPPED TO PIECES BY A LAW [LIGHT AATI-TANK WEAPON] ROUND.

   LOTS OF BLOOD AND PIECES OF FLESH STUCK TO BACKPACKS AND MILITARY
UNIFORM FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED IN A-30 METER AREA WITHIN AN EMPTY
LOT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE TOWN.

   AN OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL POLICE'S ELITE PANTERA BATTALION, WHICH
PARTICIPATED IN THE FIGHTING, TOLD AFP: "THE ROUND FELL EXACTLY WHERE
THEY WERE.  AT LEAST FOUR DIED ON THE SPOT AND MANY WERE WOUNDED."

   THE REBELS BLEW UP A GROCERY STORE AND AN ELECTRIC POLE IN DOWNTOWN
SAN ANTONIO ABAD; AND ONE DRUGSTORE AND OTHER STORES ALSO SUSTAINED
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE DURING THE FIGHTING.

   TENSION AND NERVOUSNESS PREVAILED THIS MORNING IN SAN ANTONIO ABAD,
WHERE MANY PERSONS WERE LOOKING FOR EXPLOSIVES AND TNT LEFT BEHIND BY
THE REBELS.

   ARMY SPOKESMEN HAVE YET TO ISSUE A REPORT ON THE FIGHTING AT LA
CIMA AND AYUTUXTEPEQUE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE SAID THERE WAS
FIERCE FIGHTING IN THE SECTOR, ADDING THAT THE REBELS ENTRENCHED
THEMSELVES INSIDE THE LOCAL CHURCH TO FIRE AT THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS.

   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM THE INTERIOR INDICATE THAT THE FIGHTING
DIMINISHED TODAY IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SAN
MIGUEL, WHERE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TENSE UNTIL
THE NIGHT OF 4 DECEMBER.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXPLAINED THAT THE REDUCTION IN
CURFEW HOURS, FROM 2100 TO 0500 EFFECTIVE LAST NIGHT, DOES NOT APPLY
FOR THE CITY OF ZACATECOLUCA, CAPITAL OF LA PAZ DEPARTMENT -- LOCATED
IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY -- WHICH THE GUERRILLA FORCES HAVE
BEEN CONSTANTLY HARASSING THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN WARNED THE OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL AND CROP
DUSTING AIRPLANES TO ABSTAIN FROM USING THEIR PLANMES FOR THE ARMY TO
CONDUCTRE RECONAISSANCE FLIGHTS IN THE REGION OF ZACATECOLUCA AND
USULUTAN, "BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED MILITARY TARGETS."

   VATICAN CITY (VATICAN CITY), 5 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] IN AN INTERVIEW
PUBLISHED IN THE RELIGIOUS MONTHLY MAGAZINE "30 GIORNI" (30 DAYS), SAN
SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS HAS ONCE AGAIN BLAMED THE
SALVADORAN ARMY FOR THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA).

   RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY "ONLY
THE MILITARY COULD BE AT THE SITE."  THE ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR
UNDERLINED THAT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT "IS AN AREA HIGHLY CONTROLLED
BY THE MILITARY," THAT ON THE DAY IN QUESTION "THE CURFEW OR, IN OTHER
WORDS, MARTIAL LAW WAS IN EFFECT," AND THAT "THERE IS A MILITARY
NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE UCA."

   "ALL OF THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE.  THE OPERATION LASTED 1/2 HOUR AND THE UNIFORMED
INDIVIDUALS STAYED THERE FOR A GOOD WHILE, 2 OR PERHAPS 3 HOURS.  HAD
THEY BEEN GUERRILLAS, THEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED AND FLED IMMEDIATELY,"
HE ADDED.

   ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT "THEY TOOK THE PRIESTS
OUT TO THE GARDEN, MURDERED THEM, EXPLODED DEVICES, BURNED THE HOUSE,
AND STAYED AT THE SITE FOR A LONG TIME," WHICH "MEANS THAT THEY FELT
SURE OF THEMSELVES."

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT "IT HAS BEEN FULLY
PROVEN" THAT THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL LINES WITHIN THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY: "ONE HEADED BY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, AND ANOTHER MORE RADICAL SECTOR."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
HAVE BEEN "ELIMINATED" BY THE ARMY.  " THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT
THEY WANTED, BUT, HE SAID, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED, AND THAT IS
WHY I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BEST COURSE IS THAT OF NEGOTIATION."

   REGARDING THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE BY EL SALVADOR'S ATTORNEY
GENERAL, IN WHICH HE ADVISES THE DEPARTURE OF A FEW BISHOPS FROM EL
SALVADOR, RIVERA Y DAMAS COMMENTED THAT IN A WAY IT WAS BENEFICIAL
BECAUSE "WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AS MUCH SOLIDARITY OR SUPPORT AS WE
ARE RECEIVING NOW FROM THE SUPREME PONTIFF TO THE EPISCOPAL
CONFERENCES."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN THREATENED, NOT
ONLY BY PHONE BUT BY RADIO.

PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE DOWNED IN THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  ITS CREW DIED WHEN
THE PLANE CRASHED.  IT IS A PLANE THAT CRASHED JUST AS THE REGIME OF
50 YEARS OF INJUSTICE IS CRASHING.  WE HAVE DOWNED ONE OF THE PLANES
THAT HAD BEEN BOMBING THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE HAVE DOWNED A
PLANE PILOTED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BRINGING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO
MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN MIGUEL.  WITH THE DOWNING OF THIS PLANE,
OUR PEOPLE AVENGE THE BLOOD SPILLED BY THE GENOCIDE.  THIS SHOWS THAT
THE FMLN'S ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE HAS BEGUN TO BECOME EFFECTIVE.

   LA PAZ, 27 NOV 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPTS] CHIMORE, COCHABAMBA,
26 NOV (PRESENCIA) -- THE SPECIAL ANTINARCOTICS FORCE, HEADQUARTERED IN THE
CHAPARE REGION, IS CONFISCATING A MONTHLY AVERAGE OF 500 KG OF COCAINE AS A
RESULT OF "STRICT CONTROLS AND THE SUCCESS OF ITS AGENTS."

   COLONEL MARIO VELASCO, COMMANDER OF THE MOBILE UNITS FOR RURAL
AREAS (UMOPAR), HAS SAID THAT, DESPITE EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL
LIMITATIONS, "OUR EFFORTS ARE STRONG AND RESOLVED" AND THEY HAVE
ALLOWED US TO DEAL "HARSH BLOWS TO DRUG TRAFFICKING." [PASSAGE
OMITTED]

   REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF COLOMBIAN "DRUG TRAFFICKERS" IN THIS
AREA, COL VELASCO SAID THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THEIR PRESENCE,
BUT "WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY HAD ANY CONTACTS WITH THEM OR DETAINED ANY
OF THEM."

   COL VELASCO POINTED OUT THAT INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON INTELLIGENCE
DATA ARE UNDER WAY.  THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THEM AND, IF POSSIBLE, MAKE SOME ARRESTS, HE SAID.

   COL VELASCO SAID: "ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT HAVE LEGAL DOCUMENTS,
ESPECIALLY FOREIGNERS, IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  WE ARE MAINTAINING
STRICT CONTROL AT OUR CHECKPOINTS.  WE DO INDEED HAVE INFORMATION
(ABOUT THE ALLEGED PRESENCE OF COLOMBIANS), BUT, I REPEAT, WE HAVE NOT
HAD ANY TYPE OF CONTACT WITH THEM."

   TEGUCIGALPA, 5 DEC 89 (EL HERALDO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
GUATEMALA, WHERE ARMED GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN RAMPANT, HAS BEEN THE
VICTIM OF THIS INTERCONTINENTAL INTEREST.  NICARAGUA HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY
THE SANDINIST FORCES, WHICH RECEIVE ARMS OF ALL KINDS.

   MORE ARMS THAN FOOD, MORE INSTRUCTORS THAN AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS,
AND MORE ARMS THAN FINANCE ASSISTANCE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT KEEP
REACHING NICARAGUA.

   NICARAGUA HAS BECOME A DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR OTHER COUNTRIES WHO
RAISE PIRATE FLAGS, COUNTRIES WHOSE LEADERS KNOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION
IS INTERESTED IN THE FIVE COUNTRIES OF THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS WHY THE
SOVIET UNION CONTINUALLY AIDS THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  THE
INTERRUPTION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ARMS WOULD ENTAIL FAILURE OF
THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   OVER THE COURSE OF THE TALKS ABOARD SOVIET AND U.S. SHIPS OFF
MALTA, BUSH'S POSITION REMAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERESTS OF
BOTH THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.  MANY OF THESE LATTER
COUNTRIES ARE THREATENED BY RADICAL AND CLANDESTINE MOVEMENTS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. PRESIDENT HAS JUST TAKEN FIRM STEPS TOWARD
A DIRECT UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SOVIET UNION.  THIS MEANS THAT THE
GUERRILLAS MOVEMENTS IN SEVERAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO
CONSENT TO CIVILIZED DIALOGUE SO THEY CAN COEXIST WITH THE MAJORITY OF
THE POPULATION, WHO DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE, WITH WORK AND DIGNITY.

   EL SALVADOR REPRESENTS THE MOST DANGEROUS EXAMPLE OF THIS
INTERCONTINENTAL PENETRATION.  IN THIS COUNTRY OPERATES A GUERRILLA
MOVEMENT HEAVILY SUPPLIED WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION. THESE REBELS ARE
MILITARILY AND OTHERWISE TRAINED FOR CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS THAT SOW
TERROR IN THE THREATENED TOWNS AND VILLAGES.  THE SOVIET UNION
SUPPLIES THESE ARMS THROUGH CUBA.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI EXPECTS THE ACCORDS REACHED BY THE
TWO WORLD LEADERS TO CUT THE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL TO THE FMLN.  THIS
MATERIEL HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO KILL THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   WE WILL HAVE WAITED FOR THE PASSAGE OF TIME TO SEE IF IT IS TRUE
THAT THE SUPPLY OF ARMS HAS CEASED AND THAT NICARAGUA HAS STOPPED
ASSISTING THE FMLN.

   WE ONLY HOPE THE FMLN WILL NOT COME TO HONDURAS.  THE CABINETS THAT
DRAFT WAR PLANS ARE NOW CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE FMLN'S MOVING INTO
HONDURAS.

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO
TWO VERY STRONG EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE CENTER OF BOGOTA.  WE FELT THESE
EXPLOSIONS HERE AT THE RCN [RADIO CADENA NACIONAL] BUILDING. ONE OF THE
EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED IN THE VICINITY OF THE COURTS IN THE PALO QUEMADO
SECTOR, WHERE ALL THE BOGOTA JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES ARE LOCATED.
APPARENTLY THE OTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN A STREET NEAR THE PRESIDENTIAL
PALACE.

   THERE WERE TWO EXPLOSIONS OCCURRING CONSECUTIVELY BUT VERY CLOSE
TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS FELT SO STRONGLY.  IT INITIALLY FELT
LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE: FIRST THE WAVE AND THEN THE EXPLOSION.  ALL THE
RESIDENTS IN THIS CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA FELT IT.

   IT IS ALSO SAID THAT THE EXPLOSION COULD HAVE OCCURRED CLOSER TO
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, DAS, WHICH IS LOCATED IN
THE SAME AREA.  THE DAS HEADQUARTERS ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OFFICES IN PALO QUEMADO.  THE STRONG EXPLOSION
THAT WAS FELT BY ALL OF US WHO WORK AT THIS HOUR IN THE CENTRAL BOGOTA
AREA TOOK PLACE AT 19TH CARRERA AND 25TH STREET IN PALO QUEMADO.  I
REPEAT, TWO CONSECUTIVE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED AT 0735 IN THE CENTER OF
BOGOTA.

   HERE IS SOME UPDATED INFORMATION: IT WAS NOT TWO EXPLOSIONS, AS WE
HAD INTIALLY BELIEVED, BUT THREE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED A FEW
MINUTES AGO IN BOGOTA. ONE OF THEM WAS IN THE PALO QUEMADO SECTOR, AS
WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, IN THE AREA WHERE BOTH THE BOGOTA COURTS AND
DAS ARE LOCATED.  ANOTHER EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF
BOGOTA AT 14TH CARRERA AND 28TH STREET SOUTH, APPARENTLY NEAR AN
AGRARIAN TRUST BRANCH IN THE BARRIO GUSTAVO RESTREPO NEIGHBORHOOD.  A
THIRD EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CENTRAL AREA OF BOGOTA.  THESE THREE
EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA TOOK PLACE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY, JUST A FEW
SECONDS APART.

   WE NOW HAVE OFFICIAL FIGURES OF THE EXPLOSION NEAR THE DAS
HEADQUARTERS: SEVEN PERSONS WERE KILLED, MORE THAN 50 WERE WOUNDED,
AND APPROXIMATELY 25 VEHICLES AND AT LEAST 15 BUILDINGS -- INCLUDING
THE DAS OFFICES THAT WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED -- WERE DAMAGED.
INITIALLY, DAS OFFICIALS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT A POWERFUL BOMB OF MORE
THAN 100 KG OF DYNAMITE PLACED IN A TRUCK WAS ACTIVATED.

   THE HUGE EXPLOSION CAUSED THE INITIAL DESTRUCTION OF THE FRONT PART
OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS, AS WELL AS A BUILDING WHERE THERE WAS A
HARDWARE STORE, AND THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF SIX OR SEVEN OTHER
BUILDINGS.  A CRATER 15 METERS WIDE AND 6 METERS DEEP WAS CREATED IN
27TH CARRERA.

   MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF THE EXPLOSION WERE IN PRIVATE VEHICLES AND
TAXIS, AND ONLY FOUR WERE WALKING IN THE AREA WHEN THE EXPLOSION
OCCURRED AT ALMOST 0740.  OFFICIALS SAY INITIALLY THAT THERE WERE 50
PERSONS, HIT BY GLASS SHARDS AND FLYING PIECES OF VEHICLES, INJURED IN
THE EXPLOSION.  OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE
NUMBER OF VICTIMS WILL INCREASE, AS THE ATTACK AGAINST THE DAS
HEADQUARTERS WAS VERY STRONG.  WE REPEAT: OFFICIALLY, SEVEN PERSONS
WERE KILLED HERE IN FRONT OF THE DAS HEADQUARTERS.

   SANTIAGO, 5 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ADMIRAL JOSE TORIBIO
MERINO CASTRO TODAY STATED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS DECIDED TO
MEET TWICE A WEEK, TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE HANDLING
OF DRAFT LAWS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION.  ASKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL
SITUATION IN CHILE, MERINO SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS CALM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS CALM, EXCEPT
FOR THE LEFTISTS, THAT IS, NOT THE LEFTISTS IN GENERAL BUT THOSE WHO
LIKE THROWING BOMBS AND KILLING PEOPLE.  THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE
MARRING AN EXTRAORDINARILY PERFECT DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  THIS SITUATION
IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE WHO CAN VOTE
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED, AT LEAST 99 PERCENT OF THEM. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO ADDED THAT THE PREVAILING CALM MUST CONTINUE UNDER THE
NEXT ADMINISTRATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE MUST CONTINUE IF
WE ARE TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY RESPECTFUL OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR
RIGHTS.  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS RESPECT, THERE WILL
BE TRANQUILLITY. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO STATED THAT THE NEW CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE BOARD WILL
ENSURE GREATER STABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE FOR FOREIGN
CURRENCIES.  ASKED ABOUT FIDEL CASTRO'S RECENT OFFER TO MEDIATE
BETWEEN CHILE AND BOLIVIA, MERINO SAID THAT THE CUBAN DICTATOR HAS NO
BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] [WORDS INDISTICT] FIDEL CASTRO.  THIS
SCARECROW WOULD DO BETTER TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE HE HAS NO
BUSINESS MEDDLING IN CHILE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] A CLEAR IDEA OF
PERESTROYKA AND THE OTHER LESSONS THAT GORBACHEV IS TEACHING [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  HE IS PROBABLY THINKING THAT BOLIVIA IS ABOUT TO FALL
INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS BECAUSE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT THERE
ARE LEANING TO THE LEFT, AND THAT CHILE WILL FOLLOW SUIT.  SO HE
FIGURES THAT HE, AS A LEFTIST, WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO MEDDLE IN
CHILEAN AFFAIRS.  NOT SO.  NOBODY EXCEPT WE CHILEANS WILL HANDLE OUR
AFFAIRS.

   THE BEST THING THIS CASTRO CAN DO IS STAY HOME.  HE ALREADY VISITED
CHILE; I MET HIM AND SO DID OTHERS.  HE SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT TALKING TO
[NAME INDISTINCT] IN PUNTA ARENAS WHEN I MET HIM.  SO HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO HERE. [END RECORDING]

   ADM MERINO CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION HE
WILL STAY IN HIS OFFICE, JUST IN CASE.

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIA'S ACTING PRESIDENT CARLOS
LEMOS HAS SAID THAT THE NARCOTERRORISTS WHO PERPETRATED AN ATTACK IN
BOGOTA TODAY THAT LEFT 31 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,000 INJURED "DESERVE NO
MERCY FROM GOD."

   LEMOS ADMITTED THAT THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF
COLOMBIA'S SECRET SECURITY POLICE (DAS) IN BOGOTA "IS THE MOST SERIOUS
AND THE BLOODIEST" ATTACK EVER COMMITTED IN THE COUNTRY.

   LEMOS, FILLING IN FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO IS ON AN
OFFICIAL VISIT TO JAPAN, TOLD AFP THAT CONTROLLING THE TERRORISTS "IS
VERY DIFFICULT" BECAUSE "THEY ENJOY THE ADVANTAGE OF SURPRISE."

   THE ACTING PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THAT "THE AUTHORITIES CANNOT GUARD
EVERY METER OF THE CITY STREETS."

   LEMOS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP SECURITY THROUGHOUT
THE CAPITAL, AND ADDED THAT A "HEAD-ON" STRUGGLE WILL BE WAGED AGAINST
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIAS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR A TRUCE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS," THE
ACTING MINISTER SAID.  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THE SLAUGHTER," WHICH HE
HAD WARNED ABOUT LAST WEEK BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS
NOW UNDER WAY.

   LEMOS HAS OPPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADICTION TO THE UNITED
STATES OF COLOMBIANS CHARGED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING IN A REFERENDUM
SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY.

   LEMOS SEIZED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO URGE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS (CHAMBER
AND SENATE) TO KEEP EXTRADICTION AS A TOOL TO PUNISH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   A GROUP OF PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE INSISTED ON INTRODUCING THE
EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.  THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT
THIS IS A PERNICIOUS ACTION, BECAUSE IT COULD INCREASE THE TERRORISM
THAT IS SCORCHING THE COUNTRY.

   "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF A TOOL SUCH AS
EXTRADICTION," LEMOS CONCLUDED.

   LAST NIGHT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES SURPRISINGLY APPROVED A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THE EXTRADICTION ISSUE IN THE
REFERENDUM.

   LA PAZ, 27 NOV 89 (EL DIARIO) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED BY
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COMMISSION, DRUG TRAFFICKING
IS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IN BOLIVIA PREVENTING A SOCIAL EXPLOSION BECAUSE
IT CONTRIBUTES 20 PERCENT OF THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

   "THE BOLIVIAN LABOR FORCE IS OFFICIALLY MADE UP OF 1.7 MILLION
PEOPLE.  THE DRUG BUSINESS PROVIDES ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR FOUR
JOBS," THE REPORT STATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DATA OBTAINED FROM
GOVERNMENT CIRCLES.

   IT ADDS THAT THE COCAINE "BOOM" IN BOLIVIA COINCIDED WITH THE TOUGH
ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED SINCE 1981 AND THAT THE
"COCA-DOLLARS" HAVE CUSHIONED THE SOCIAL EXPLOSION.

   "LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING ACQUIRES SYSTEMS OF
CAPITAL AND DISTRIBUTION.  IT ALSO HAS FIXED EXPENDITURES.  THESE
"INVESTMENTS" INCLUDE RAW MATERIAL (COCA LEAVES), CHEMICAL PRODUCTS
AND LABORATORIES, CHEMISTS, TRANSPORTATION, SERVICES (LEGAL AND
FINANCIAL), AND SECURITY, WHICH INCLUDES PAYMENTS OF TIPS TO PUBLIC
OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS, JUDGES, AND POLICEMEN.  IN SOME COUNTRIES THE
GUERRILLAS ARE PAID TO PROVIDE PROTECTION," THE COMMISSION'S REPORT
STATES.

   THE COMMISSION REPORTS THAT SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA HAS BECOME A
PROSPEROUS TOWN PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TRADE.  "ONE OF THE
CLEAREST EFFECTS RECORDED IN THE THREE COCAINE AREAS IS THAT IT
PROVIDES JOB OPPORTUNITIES," THE REPORT STATES.  IT ADDS THAT BETWEEN
750,000 AND 1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED IN THE DRUG
BUSINESS IN BOLIVIA.

   IT STATES THAT COCA LEAF PRODUCTION IS WHAT PROVIDES MOST OF THE
JOB OPPORTUNTIES IN THIS BUSINESS.  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 500,000
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED EXCLUSIVELY IN COCA LEAF PRODUCTION.

   THE NUMBER OF PRODUCERS IN THE CHAPARE REGION IS ESTIMATED AT
36,864, AND THEY ARE LINKED IN 6 FEDERATIONS, 54 ASSOCIATIONS
[CENTRALES], AND 610 UNIONS.  IN THE YUNGAS ZONE OF LA PAZ, THE NUMBER
OF PRODUCERS IS ESTIMATED AT 26,280, ORGANIZED INTO 4 FEDERATIONS, 14
ASSOCIATIONS, AND 650 COLONIES OR COMMUNITIES.

   THE COCA CROP IS ESTIMATED TO BE 45,100 HECTARES (DATA FROM 1988)
IN THE CHAPARE ZONE AND 19,695 HECTARES IN THE YUNGAS AREA OF LA PAZ.

   THE ESTIMATED COCA PRODUCTION IN THE CHAPARE AND YUNGAS REGIONS
AMOUNTS TO 117,486 AND 73,634 TONS PER YEAR, RESPECTIVELY.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT ADDS THAT 12,381 TONS OF COCA WERE EARMARKED
FOR CHEWING AND THAT 132,038.3 TONS WERE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.

   SANTIAGO, NO DATE (RADIO CHILENA NETWORK) -- [INTERVIEW WITH AYLWIN
BY SOLA] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [SOLA] RELATIONS BETWEEN CHILE AND
BOLIVIA HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO FACE
BOLIVIA'S DEMAND FOR A SEA OUTLET?

   [AYLWIN] FIRST, CHILE MAINTAINS A FIRM STAND ON THIS SUBJECT, A
FACT THAT MUST BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND THE
REST OF THE WORLD.  CHILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY BORDER CONFLICTS WITH
BOLIVIA.  OUR BORDER WITH BOLIVIA HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY AN
INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT WAS FREELY APPROVED BY OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
THIS TREATY CONSTITUTES AN OBLIGATORY NORM FOR CHILE AND BOLIVIA.

   SECOND, ACCORDING TO THIS TREATY, CHILE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO
GRANT BOLIVIA TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO PORTS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.

   THIRD, IN FACE OF THE BOLIVIAN ASPIRATIONS TO OBTAIN GREATER
FACILITIES OR A NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO
REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  THIS IS A BILATERAL ISSUE BETWEEN
BOLIVIA AND CHILE.  IT IS NOT AN HEMISPHERIC MATTER OR A MATTER TO BE
DECIDED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   I TRUST THAT BOLIVIA AND CHILE WILL REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION.  WE MUST BE
AWARE THAT THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARD INTEGRATION AND THAT IT IS MORE
CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US TO ATTAIN THE BEST AND MOST INTEGRATED
RELATIONS POSSIBLE.  WE MUST SEEK SOLUTIONS AND, AS THE BOLIVIAN
PRESIDENT RECENTLY STATED, WE MUST SEEK IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH A
21ST CENTURY AND NOT A 19TH CENTURY VIEW.  I HOPE THAT WITHIN THIS
SPIRIT WE WILL MANAGE NOT ONLY TO REESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH BOLIVIA,
BUT TO ESTABLISH SATISFACTORY RELATIONS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES.

   [SOLA] CHILEAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN
EXCELLENT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE MURDER OF ORLANDO LETELIER
IS TIED INTO THIS SITUATION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT,
CONSIDERING THAT A U.S. COURT HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF GENERAL
CONTRERAS AND COLONEL ESPINOZA?

   [AYLWIN] WELL, I HOPE THAT CHILE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST RELATIONS
POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED
STATES, A COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE ARE LINKED FOR MANY REASONS.  I
DISCUSSED THIS SUBJECT WITH PEOPLE FROM U.S. DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL,
AND ECONOMIC CIRCLES, AND I HAVE NOTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATING US AS
SOON AS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS REESTABLISHED.

   I DO NOT THINK THAT AN EXTRADITION WILL SOLVE THE LETELIER CASE
BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED ON BY THE SUPREME COURT.  IT IS WHAT
WE LAWYERS REFER TO AS AN ADJUDGED MATTER.  I THINK THAT CHILE CAN
DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP CLARIFY THE CASE AND GUARANTEE
JUSTICE, AS IT IS OUR [WORD INDISTINCT] PURPOSE IN ALL HUMAN RIGHTS
PROBLEMS, SO AS TO SATISFY THE MOST DEMANDING CONSCIENCES OF THE
WORLD. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF
THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [PONCE, IN PROGRESS] ...THE OFFENSIVE
OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] AS OF 11
NOVEMBER HAS BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED HERE IN THE CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR, AS WELL AS IN SAN MIGUEL, USULUTAN, AND ZACATECOLUCA, WHERE
THERE WAS GREATER ACTIVITY BY THE SUBVERSIVES.  LOGICALLY, AFTER BEING
REJECTED SO MUCH, AFTER HAVING LOST SO MANY FIGTHERS AND WAR MATERIEL,
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO AGAIN LAUNCH AN OPERATION LIKE THEY
DID ON 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM
AND SELECTIVE TERRORISM.  WE HAVE HERE SOME OF THE FIRST EVIDENCE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MURDER OF A PERSON USEFUL TO SALVADORAN SOCIETY LIKE
DR GUERRERO, THE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, THE
DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.  WE CAN ALSO MENTION THE
DESTRUCTION OF SOME GASOLINE STATIONS.  BASICALLY, WHAT THEY SEEK IS
TO SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY, TO PROVOKE THE
CLOSING OF SOME INDUSTRIAL CENTERS, AND TO BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC CHAOS.

   THAT IS WHY, EVEN THOUGH WE BELIEVED WE WERE TAKING RISKS IN THE
MILITARY FIELD OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE ARMED FORCES CHANGED THE
CURFEW HOURS, SO THAT CURFEW HOURS ARE NOW FROM 2300 TO 0500.  WE DID
THIS BELIEVING THAT THE ECONOMIC ASPECT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE
COUNTRY, AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO BENEFIT THE INDUSTRIAL, BUSINESS,
AND FARMING SECTORS, SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR
ACTIVITIES UNDER ALMOST NORMAL CONDITIONS.

   WE ALSO CONSIDERED THAT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR WE ARE PICKING COFFEE
AND COTTON AND HARVESTING SUGARCANE, AND THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN
STAPLES OF OUR ECONOMY.  THESE ACTIVITIES ARE MAINLY CARRIED OUT IN
THE EVENING, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CHANGED THE CURFEW HOURS TO
BENEFIT BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND FARMERS SO THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR
FAMILIES.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT DURING THE COSTA
RICAN MEETING ENOUGH PRESSURE CAN BE EXERTED ON NICARAGUA SO THAT IT
WILL SUSPEND ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN AND THE WAR WILL DIMINISH IN THE
COUNTRY?

   [PONCE] THE CYNICISM OF THE DICTATOR ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FULLY PROVEN.  IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF ESQUIPULAS II, HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO DISCONTINUING
SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN.  THIS TOTAL WAR OFFENSIVE THAT HAS BEEN
INFLICTED UPON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUSPENDED, BECAUSE WE
ARE SURE THAT THE MOMENT NICARAGUA AND CUBA -- IT IS THROUGH THOSE
COUNTRIES, RATHER THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS BEEN
HELPING THE FMLN -- THE FMLN WOULD WEAKEN TREMENDOUSLY.  [SENTENCE AS
HEARD]

   AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, AS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMAND, I
FEEL VERY PROUD ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL, DETERMINED, AND COURAGEOUS
ATTITUDE WITH WHICH THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND
TROOPS OF OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE NEUTRALIZED AND DEFEATED THE FMLN
OFFENSIVE.  IN THIS REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE OPINIONS VOICED BY
GENERAL THURMAN ARE NOT REALLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE LIVED HERE

   BOGOTA, 6 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] COMPATRIOTS, AS YOU KNOW, I CAME TO
JAPAN TO FULFILL A MISSION IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXPRESSED
ITS SOLIDARITY WITH COLOMBIA.

   I HAVE BEEN, HOWEVER, CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION
WITH DEEP SADNESS AND INDIGNATION AFTER THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE DAS
[ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] FACILITIES, WHICH
DEEPLY SHOOK ALL COLOMBIANS.

   I HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONS, THE
MINISTER DESIGNATED TO ACT ON MY BEHALF AND WITH MY CLOSEST
ASSISTANTS.

   IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE VILE
ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.
THOSE ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN THE LIFE OF MANY INNOCENT COLOMBIANS.  MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, WHO WERE IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES, HAVE BEEN
SACRIFICED BY MAD ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY CRIMINALS, WHO INTEND TO
CONTROL AN ENTIRE PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT, AND COUNTRY THROUGH TERROR AND
DESTRUCTION.

   THEY WILL NOT DEFEAT US.  WE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING.  THE
WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ON DEMOCRACY.  WE WILL
NOT FALL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE NARCOTERRORISTS' BLOODY TYRANNY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE COUNTRY LEARNED ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF
REPRESENTATIVES'S DECISION TO APPROVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH
THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM.

   THE CONFIRMATION THAT THE AVIANCA PLANE CRASH WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB;
THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO URIBE, ROVING 13TH JUDGE OF CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION; AND THIS MORNING'S ATROCIOUS ATTACK ON THE DAS
FACILITIES FURTHER PROVES THAT THE DECISION MADE BY THE CHAMBER OF
REPRESENTATIVES IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

   WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT ACCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRYING TO FORCE OUR
LEGISLATORS TO ADOPT A DECISION THAT WOULD ONLY BRING MORE DESTRUCTION
AND DEATH TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IF THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION
ISSUE IS APPROVED IN THE REFERENDUM, IT WOULD NOT BE A DECISION MADE
BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, BUT BY THE FORCE OF BULLETS AND
TERROR.

   COLOMBIANS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE TO FIND OUT
WHAT THESE CRIMINALS REALLY THINK.  THEY SPOKE ABOUT A TRUCE AND THEN
THEY MURDERED A JUDGE.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES
APPROVED THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE INTO THE REFERENDUM
AND, IN GOOD FAITH, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD
PEACE WITH THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THEY WERE WRONG.  THE NEXT DAY THE
DAS FACILITIES WERE ATTACKED.

   THOSE ACTIONS PROVE WHAT THOSE CRIMINALS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING TO
OBTAIN A FAVORABLE DECISION IN THE REFERENDUM.  THEY DO NOT CONDUCT AN
ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR TO ATTAIN THEIR GOALS.

   I NOW REITERATE WHAT I SAID IN MY SPEECH BEFORE LEAVING FOR JAPAN.
I SAID THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE
REFERENDUM IS HIGHLY UNSUITABLE.

   I SHARE THE SORROW AND SADNESS OF ALL MY COMPATRIOTS, ESPECIALLY
VICTIMS' RELATIVES.  OUR INDIGNATION MUST REPRESENT ALL COLOMBIANS'
INTENTION TO JOIN EFFORTS AND DROP PERSONAL INTERESTS.

   COMPATRIOTS, WE MUST NEVER, WE WILL NEVER SUCCUMB TO THE
NARCOTERRORISTS.  THE STABLE DEMOCRACY WE HAVE BUILT AND DEFENDED WITH
GREAT EFFORT FOR OVER 1 CENTURY IS ENDANGERED.  THROUGHOUT ITS
HISTORY, COLOMBIA HAS OVERCOME MORE DIFFICULT TIMES.  LET US ALL STAND
UP WITH FAITH, COURAGE, AND FIRMNESS TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND AND
FREEDOM.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WILL DEPART FROM NARITA AIRPORT, LOCATED 2 HOURS FROM TOKYO, [WORDS

COLOMBIAN COFFEE.  THE EVENT WAS ORGANIZED BY THE COLOMBIAN COFFEE
GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND THE GRAN COLOMBIAN MERCHANT FLEET'S
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FAR EAST.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BARCO] APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS AGO AN AIRPLANE
EXPLODED WHEN TAKING OFF FROM BOGOTA, AND EXPERTS WHO CAME FROM MANY
PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB PLACED
ON BOARD RATHER THAN A PROBLEM OF PRESSURIZATION.

   THE OTHER CASE IS THE ATTACK WHICH WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT, 2
NIGHTS AGO, AGAINST THE INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE.  YOU HAVE READ OR REPORTED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT... [CHANGES

AND CAUSED THE COLLAPSE OR CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE OF THE GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS OF THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND DRUG TRAFFICKING
ARE CARRIED OUT.  [CONTINUED]

   TOKYO (JAPAN), 7 DEC 89 (KYODO) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS SAID HERE ON THURSDAY HIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BOW TO TERRORIST
THREATS EXEMPLIFIED BY WEDNESDAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION IN BOGOTA.

   BARCO, WHO IS ON A FOUR-DAY VISIT TO JAPAN THROUGH FRIDAY, SAID
THAT SUCH SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ARE BASED ON THE MISTAKEN BELIEF OF
TERRORISTS THAT VIOLENCE CAN TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT.

   HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FIGHT OFF SUCH CHALLENGES.

   A TRUCK, PACKED WITH DYNAMITE, EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY, COLOMBIA'S
FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS POLICE, ON WEDNESDAY.

   AT LEAST 35 PEOPLE DIED AND 350 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE BLAST,
WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S
ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE DRUG TRADE.

   COLOMBIA IS SAID TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF THE ILLICIT DRUG,
COCAINE, TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED ITS CRACKDOWN ON THE
COCAINE SMUGGLERS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE ON AUGUST 18.

   BARCO, SPEAKING AT THE JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS CLUB EXPRESSED CONCERN
ABOUT AN INCREASE OF COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND CALLED FOR WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS TO
HELP STABILIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, WITH PARTICULAR
EMPHASIS ON MORE ECONOMIC SUPPORT.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY COLOMBIA WOULD CALL ON THE UNITED
STATES TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH ARMED FORCES, THE PRESIDENT
EMPHASIZED HE HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING ANY INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGN
COUNTRIES IN HIS NATION.

   BARCO IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE JAPAN FOR COLOMBIA FRIDAY.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 7 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ PREDICTED A SERIOUS CRISIS ON THE CONTINENT IF A SOLUTION FOR
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT IS NOT FOUND.  HE APPEALED TO "THE FOREIGN
POWERS" TO HALT THEIR INTERVENTION IN THE SUBREGION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE BROADCAST OVER TELEVISION FOR ALL THE COUNTRY,
PEREZ TODAY PREDICTED THAT THE COMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE WILL FAIL IF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS
"FOREIGN POWERS" DO NOT HALT MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE
VARIOUS FACTIONS FIGHTING IN THE CONVULSED REGION.

   THE COSTA RICAN, NICARAGUAN, GUATEMALAN, SALVADORAN, AND HONDURAN
PRESIDENTS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE SHORTLY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND REACTIVATE THE ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA
PACIFICATION ACCORDS.

   "IF THE FOREIGN POWERS, BE THEY THE UNITED STATES, CUBA, THE SOVIET
UNION, OR WHATEVER, PERSIST ON DISTURBING A DIRECT ANALYSIS AND
PREVENTING A FRIENDLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, THIS SUMMIT WILL COME TO NOTHING," PEREZ POINTED OUT.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE RECENT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] OFFENSIVE IN EL SALVADOR INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE
REGIONAL PACIFICATION PROCESS.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT CLARIFY THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.

   "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SALVADORAN CRISIS OCCURRED AT AN
UNTIMELY MOMENT, WHEN THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL.  THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS, HOWEVER, RESTS HEAVILY WITH THE FMLN AND THOSE WHO GAVE ARMS
TO THE REBELS SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT SO MAJOR A MILITARY OPERATION,"
HE SAID.

   HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX JESUITS, WHO WERE MURDERED IN A LOWLY AND
WICKED MANNER. THIS MUST BE CLARIFIED ALSO," HE SAID.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, WHO OFFERED TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, SAID HE REPORTED TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, THE
SUMMIT'S HOST, THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THAT THE FMLN SENT TO PEREZ,
IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION PROPOSES A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL
VERIFICATION.

   PEREZ ASKED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE
"THE FATE OF ALL OF LATIN AMERICA IS AT STAKE."

   REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT -- HE SAID HE WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING COSTA RICA AS SITE FOR THE MEETING -- PEREZ
ASSUMED AN "OPTIMISTIC YET CONCERNED" STANCE WITH REGARD TO THE
MEETING'S RESULTS.

   HE FINALLY SAID: "THIS SAN JOSE SUMMIT WILL MAKE THINGS CONFORM TO
ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LEFT
ALONE AND PARTICULARLY IF THEY KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE BACKED
BY ANY ONE POWER WITH ARMS OR MONEY."

DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] FACILITIES.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS DIRECTOR, A SPANISH TERRORIST AND ETA [BASQUE
FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY] MEMBER WHO COULD HAVE ADVISED THE
COLOMBIANS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE CAR BOMB HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

   DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF
HIS SUBORDINATES AND FELLOW WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF AN
EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES.  AT THE END OF THE RELIGIOUS
CEREMONY, GEN MAZA SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT
FOREIGN TERRORISTS PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GEN MAZA] THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS COULD BE SO,
BECAUSE THE METHODS AND SYSTEM USED TO FABRICATE THE CAR BOMB LEAD US TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EXPERTS IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY.  [END RECORDING]

   LIMA, 7 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] PRESIDENT ALAN
GARCIA ANNOUNCED THAT THE BORDERS WILL BE REOPENED.  HE SAID THAT THE
RESULTS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED 15 DAYS AGO ARE POSITIVE.  THE PRESIDENT
CALLED ON ALL BUSINESSMEN AND INDUSTRIALISTS NOT TO SPECULATE ON PRICES.  HE
ALSO REITERATED HIS SUPPORT FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE MINISTER CESAR VASQUEZ
BAZAN, WHO HE SAID IS MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO FACE THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC
SITUATION.  GARCIA MADE THESE STATEMENTS AFTER A MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] THE BORDER CLOSURE
MEASURE EXPIRES TODAY.  WILL IT BE EXTENDED?

   [GARCIA] NO, THE BORDERS WERE NEVER CLOSED.  WE ONLY ESTABLISHED
SOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF TRANSIT PERMITS IN TACNA TO PREVENT AN
INCREASE OF SMUGGLING BEFORE THE YEAR-END FESTIVITIES.  THE 15-DAY
TERM OF THAT MEASURE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.

   [REPORTER] APPARENTLY, THAT MEASURE HAS NOT HAD GOOD RESULTS.

   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS
BECAUSE SMUGGLING HAS PROBABLY DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  AS YOU KNOW, A FEW
YEARS AGO CHILE ESTABLISHED THE IQUIQUE FREE ZONE WHERE PRODUCTS ARE
SOLD TO PERU AND BOLIVIA.  THUS A STABLE MARKET OF HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHICH DAILY PASS THOROUGH THE TACNA BORDER WITH
SMALL PACKAGES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

   WE SIMPLY RESTRICTED THE PERMITS THEY USE TO BRING IN A TAPE
RECORDER OR LASER DISC PLAYERS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT SMUGGLING DECREASED
FOR A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, THAT MERCHANDISE ENTERED THE COUNTRY BY
OTHER MEANS.  WE CANNOT IMPOSE TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE CAN ASK
THE CUSTOMS OFFICE AND THE POLICE TO INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROL
EXCESSIVE SMUGGLING INTO THE COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR WILL DROP BY
JANUARY?

   [GARCIA] I AM SURE IT WILL.  LAST YEAR, LIKE NOW, THE FREE- MARKET
DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE INCREASED SHARPLY BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING
YEAR-END BONUSES AND THEY ARE CONVERTING THEIR PROFITS INTO DOLLARS.
PEOPLE ARE TAKING HOLIDAY TRIPS AND BUYING MORE GOODS AND HOME
APPLIANCES.  THEREFORE, THE DOLLAR DEMAND AND PRICES HAVE INCREASED.

   LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MUC [SINGLE EXCHANGE MARKET] DOLLAR
EXCHANGE RATE WAS AT 500 INTIS TO A DOLLAR, THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR
CLIMBED TO 2,000 INTIS.  LATER IT DROPPED TO 1,000 INTIS IN JANUARY.
I THINK THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [REPORTER] THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RUMORS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT
THE ECONOMY MINISTER IS ABOUT TO RESIGN OR IS BEING PRESSURED TO
RESIGN.  IS THIS TRUE?

   [GARCIA] THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD PRESSURE HIM IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT PRESSURING HIM.  WE ACKNOWLEDGE
THE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES OF THE PERUVIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF
THE ECONOMY MINISTER.  I EXPRESS MY RECOGNITION OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE
ECONOMY MINISTER BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, WELL-INTENTIONED, AND VERY HONEST; HE
HAS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.  HE IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO STABILIZE THE
ECONOMY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE, AND HE SPONSORED A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AFTER
THE ELECTIONS.

   [REPORTER] TODAY DID THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS DISCUSS A WAGE
INCREASE FOR THIS MONTH?

   [GARCIA] THAT POINT MUST BE DEFINED BY THE ECONOMY AND LABOR
MINISTERS.  TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE BORDER ISSUE, WE DISCUSSED A
SUBJECT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO.

   ON THAT OCCASION I LISTENED TO A REPORT FROM THE SO-CALLED
COMMANDER HUAIHUACU.  HE IS CHIEF OF SOME 85 PEASANT COMMUNITIES ALONG
THE APURIMAC RIVER WHICH HAVE REBELLED AGAINST SHINING PATH CONTROL.
THE APURIMAC RIVER SEPARATES THE AYACUCHO AND CUSCO DEPARTMENTS, AND
THESE PEASANTS LIVE IN AN AREA CALLED OREJA DE PERRO IN LA MAR
PROVINCE.  THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT A DEMOCRATIC UPRISING AND ORGANIZED
THEMSELVES TO KEEP SHINING PATH FROM ENTERING THEIR COMMUNITIES.

   THIS SO-CALLED COMMANDER HUAIHUACU, WHO IS A MAN OF ACTION, HAS
ORGANIZED APPROXIMATELY 85 COMMUNITIES ON THE BANKS OF THE APURIMAC
RIVER, IN AYACUCHO PROVINCE OF LA MAR AND THE CUSCO DISTRICT OF
CHARATE.  HUAIHUACU HAS COME TO LIMA SEEKING SUPPORT.

   WE HAVE DECIDED WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO GO TOMORROW TO
RINCONADA BAJA AREA IN LA MAR PROVINCE, SHINING PATH'S PRIMARY AREA OF
ACTIVITY FOR 10 YEARS.  THERE I WILL DEDICATE A RADIO STATION TO BE
CALLED RADIO DEMOCRACIA. ITS AIM WILL BE TO BROADCAST NEWS AND
DEMOCRATIC AND PATRIOTIC MESSAGES FROM THAT AREA WHICH IS A CENTER OF
PEASANT RESISTANCE AGAINST TERRORISM.

   WE WILL ARRIVE THERE TOMORROW AND TALK WITH THE PEASANT LEADERS WHO
FOR YEARS HAVE FOUGHT SHINING PATH TOGETHER WITH OUR NAVY INFANTRY
UNITS STATIONED IN LUISIANA AND SAN FRANCISCO. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END

HEADED BY CRISTIANI, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, REPEL, OR CONTAIN
THE HEROIC FMLN, HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST
DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, SOW DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND COMMIT MASSACRES.

   THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH ARE
DESPERATE DUE TO THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF THE FMLN FORCES -- WHICH
HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED, BUT EXPANDED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND THE REST OF THE TERRITORY OF THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY -- HAVE LOST
CONTROL.

   WITH VENGEANCE IN THEIR MINDS, THEY HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A
NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUST
STRUGGLES OF THE MAJORITY.  AT DAWN ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR THEM WERE BRUTALLY ASSASSINATED.
WE SHARE THE GREAT SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND ADD OUR PROTEST TO THOSE OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD WHO HAVE ALREADY PROTESTED THESE DESPICABLE ASSASSINATIONS.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS INCIDENT AND URGES
ALL GUATEMALANS AND ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF THESE GENOCIDAL AND BARBARIC
ACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN
VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DID IN WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR 13 NOVEMBER STATEMENT, WE DENOUNCED THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS AGAINST THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY.  ON 15 NOVEMBER,
PRESS AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY HAD DEPLOYED 126
UNITS OF THE SPECIAL KAIBILES [COUNTERINSURGENCY] TROOPS, WHO
ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR PATHOLOGICAL SAVAGERY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY STAFF, AND THE
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PUBLICLY
EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH CRISTIANI AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  WE
CONDEMN WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTION AMONG
THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE CALL ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE GUATEMALAN POPULATION TO EXPRESS
THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS INTERVENTION.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ADVISE THE WORLD THAT EL SALVADOR
MIGHT FACE AN EVEN WORSE GENOCIDE THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY
ENDURING.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL
THEIR ENEMIES, WIN THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.
THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL BREED NEW LIFE AND WILL UNDOUBTELY
LEAD US TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] "JUST A FEW WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT MILITARY
SITUATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN'S
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE
OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE
CAPITAL THERE ARE STILL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN
AREA, IN THE NORTHWEST -- THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO-- AND IN THE NORTHEAST,
TO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO MUNCIPALITY.  THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN
THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED.
FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES
INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN IN 3 DAYS.

   "WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LEFT WITHIN THE CAPITAL GREAT
NUMBERS OF WEAPONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.  SOME GROUPS
ARE IN HIDING, USING CIVILIANS, AND ARE CARRYING OUT TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES.  THEY HAVE BURNED BUSES, GASOLINE STATIONS AND MURDERED DR
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO; AND ON 7 DECEMBER, THEY FIRED THREE OR FOUR
MORTAR ROUNDS AT RANDOM, FALLING ON PRIVATE HOMES.  ONE OF THEM FELL
ON THE HOUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT.  WE BELIEVE
THESE ACTIONS ARE JUST MERE TERRORISM, INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING MORTARS
ON THE CAPITAL'S CIVILIANS.

   "WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO FURTHER CAPACITY EXCEPT TO CARRY OUT THESE
TERRORIST ACTS TO CREATE CONFUSION AND ANARCHY AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THANK GOD, OUR POPULATION IS VERY BRAVE AND HEROIC. WE
HAVE BEEN NOTICING WITH PRIDE HOW THE POPULATION HAS BEEN WORKING
NORMALLY IN ALL OF SAN SALVADOR, GOING TO THEIR JOBS, WITH BUSINESSES
OPENING AND TRYING TO OPERATE NORMALLY.  THERE ARE STILL SOME THREATS
IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, WHERE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE
CONCENTRATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY.  HERE, TOO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEGUN AN OFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY END ANY IMMINENT DANGER."

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10
DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS,
VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN
URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD
CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS.

   [CRISTIANI] "AS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN AGAINST CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO
FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IT HAS BEEN THE
FMLN THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP
AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.  WE,
HOWEVER, ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEFINITE PROPOSAL IN COSTA RICA, WHICH IN
GENERAL TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS:

   "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS,
WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING [3-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION],
THE FMLN SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT
WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS.  WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT
ASKING THEM TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AS WAS ATTEMPTED MANY TIMES.  IF
THE FMLN CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL
CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM.  TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS MUST END.
THE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO CONTINUE BEING THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE
IRRATIONALITY OF ALL THIS FIGHTING. WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN CAN DO
IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MILITARY TARGETS ARE SOMETHING ELSE; BUT IF WE
ANALYZE THINGS, UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT A SINGLE MILITARY OBJECTIVE WAS
THE TARGET SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
OVER A CIVIL DEFENSE POST.  ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN AGAINST CIVILIANS,
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THEM, TRYING TO CREATE TERROR AMONG THE
POPULATION.  THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN'S
PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY
OF DIALOGUE.  IF THE FMLN TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO
CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE
TOPICS THE FMLN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT. THJIS WILL BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THAT BY 15 FEBRUARY WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS,
ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT "THE UNITED STATES SAYS
THAT IT WANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IT IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE."

   ARCHBISHOP RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF
ASSUMING THIS ATTITUDE IS.  HOWEVER, WHEN EYEWITNESS LUCIA BARRERA DE
CERNA FIRST TESTIFIED, SHE CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE MEN AS BEING DRESSED
AS SOLDIERS AND NOT AS GUERRILLAS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS EASY TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE WAY OF DRESSING AND ANOTHER."

   IT SEEMS THAT THE PLAN IS TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH OTHER
PATHS, AND THAT IS WHY THE U.S. OFFICIALS TOOK THE EYEWITNESS TO THE
UNITED STATES, "WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN AN AUTHENTIC BRAINWASHING AND
THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH."

   ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS' LAWYER, SCOTT GRATHEAD, MRS. CERNA WAS
SUBJECTED TO AN "AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT" QUESTIONING SESSION.  AFTER
THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT, SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AND RETRACTED HER
STATEMENT.  FORTUNATELY, ONCE RID OF THE PRESSURE FROM HER
"PROTECTORS," SHE HAS RETAKEN THE PATH OF TRUTH.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY, THE ARCHBISHOP DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES FOR
TREATING THE WITNESS DIFFERENTLY ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES, INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HER LIKE THE U.S.  EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN
SAN SALVADOR HAD PROMISED, KNOWING THAT THE HUMBLE WORKING WOMAN
"FREELY AND SINCERELY HAD DECLARED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE
NIGHT OF THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE."  THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON
THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.

   REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE NATION'S ATTORNEY GENERAL,
WHO SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS -- A LAWYER-PRIEST
HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION -- THE
ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE BUT ALSO
MALICIOUS.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY THE PRELATE SAID THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT
THE LAYMEN'S GROUND, AND THAT IS WHERE THEY SHOULD PROVE THEIR
EXPERTISE AND MORAL INTEGRITY. THEY SHOULD IMBUE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR
PROFESSION WITH EVANGELICAL VALUES.

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT, IN THE SECOND PLACE, "IT COULD BE A
TRAP."  HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE WITH A
CLERGYMAN'S PRESENCE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
"MURKY."

   THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS LINKED TO THE INVESTIGATION IN AN
INDEPENDENT WAY HAVE BEEN DISTRUSTFUL EVER SINCE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA'S
TESTIMONY.  SHE WAS TESTIFYING AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE LAWYERS
AND AMBASSADORS, AND AS THE CURFEW HOUR APPROACHED, THEY TOOK THE
WITNESS TO ANOTHER EMBASSY.  THE NEXT DAY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAME
TO HARASS THE WITNESS WITH QUESTIONS.

   THE ARCHBISHOP ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
ACCUSATION.  HE REITERATED THE BELIEF THAT THE ARMED FORCES WERE
GUILTY OF THE MURDERS.  HE SAID, "I AM NOT MAKING ANY ACCUSATIONS.
HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS VERY ANNOYED, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SAYING THAT
WE ARE THE OBJECT OF OFFICIAL PERSECUTION, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THIS REGIME THERE IS PERSECUTION IN OTHER SECTORS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A SPOKESMAN FOR THE
LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE [CD] SAID TODAY THAT, IF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS RESTART TALKS ON 20 DECEMBER, THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL OPPOSITION WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS "SO THAT THE
PEOPLE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ATTAINING PEACE."

   A SOURCE FROM THAT POLITICAL GROUP, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER TWO
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WITH ONE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY AND IS A
MEMBER OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT THESE GROUPS
"SUPPORT ALL INITIATIVES FAVORING PEACE."

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT "IF A DIALOGUE DOES TAKE PLACE, WE WANT
THE PEOPLE, REPRESENTED BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES, TO TAKE PART IN THIS
PROCESS THAT EL SALVADOR NEEDS MORE THAN EVER TODAY."

   THE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
PROPOSAL ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, IN WHICH HE EXPRESSES HIS WILLINGNESS TO
RESTART THE DIALOGUE IF THE GUERRILLAS STOP "THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION" BY 15 DECEMBER, IS "FEASIBLE AS LONG
AS THERE IS A SINCERE WILL."

   CRISTIANI'S PROPOSAL TO THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) WILL BE REVEALED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
DURING THEIR SIXTH SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA TODAY.  THE SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT EXPECTS TO RECEIVE HIS COLLEAGUES' POLITICAL SUPPORT.

   THE CD BELIEVES THAT CRISTIANI "DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR
WARMONGERING OR DEFIANT IN COSTA RICA, AND WILL BRING TO SAN JOSE A
MORE MARKETABLE PROPOSAL THAT HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS."

   "THE DIALOGUE THAT HE PROPOSES IS FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE, BUT THE
PEOPLE MUST BE INVOLVED IN IT," THE SOURCE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED THAT THE "NEGATIVE" ASPECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL IS
THAT "IT FAILS TO MENTION THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ARREST
AND PERSECUTION OF POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THE STATE OF SIEGE IN FORCE
SINCE 12 NOVEMBER."

   THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS WORSENED SINCE 11
NOVEMBER, WHEN THE GUERRILLAS LAUNCHED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN 10
YEARS OF FIGHTING.

   CRISTIANI BELIEVES THAT IF THE FMLN SUSPENDS ITS HOSTILITIES
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION THE DIALOGUE COULD BE RESUMED ON 20
DECEMBER IN CARACAS AND "THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION TO THE ARMED
CONFLICT" IN THIS COUNTRY ON 20 FEBRUARY 1990.

   THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT YET REPLIED TO THE PROPOSAL OF CRISTIANI,
WHO GAVE ASSURANCES THAT THE REBELS ARE "NOT BEING ASKED TO LAY DOWN
THEIR ARMS."

   IN FACT, CRISTIANI NOTED THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN HIS WILLINGNESS TO
TAKE PART IN A "DIALOGUE" EVEN IF THE GUERRILLAS ATTACK POSITIONS THAT
ARE "STRICTLY MILITARY.  OUR SOLE CONDITION IS THAT THEY SUSPEND
TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   THE WAR THAT BEGAN 10 YEARS AGO IN EL SALVADOR HAS LEFT MORE THAN
70,000 DEAD.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 10 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMAN] [TEXT] I CAME
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT OUR REPORTER FRIENDS WERE GREATLY INTERESTED
IN KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING.  I UNDERSTAND THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I
WORKED AS A NEWSMAN FOR MANY YEARS.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED TO
TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO OUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SO
INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT,
AND TO THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, WHO ARE INTERESTED THAT
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARD A FINAL PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   YESTERDAY EVENING, THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREED NOT TO SPEAK TO THE
PRESS INDIVIDUALLY.  WE APPOINTED COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO
MADRIGAL NIETO AS OUR SPOKESMAN.  HE SAID WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO SAY AT
THAT TIME.  IN FACT, THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE TO REPORT NOW.  FOREIGN
MINISTER MADRIGAL NIETO TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS
HAD BASICALLY DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO EXAMINING THREE TOPICS.  WE ALSO
HAD TWO MORE TOPICS, BUT IN ALL THERE WERE THREE TOPICS.  I THINK HE
MENTIONED THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN EL
SALVADOR, AND A THIRD TOPIC, BUT RIGHT NOW I DO NOT DARE TO SAY WHAT
IT WAS LEST I MAKE A MISTAKE.  [AT THIS POINT, AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON
INTERRUPTS, SAYING: "ONUCA"]

   HE MENTIONED ONUCA [UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA].
THAT IS CORRECT.  IN FACT, WE DISCUSSED FIVE TOPICS, BUT IF HE
SAID...[CHANGES THOUGHT] ONUCA WAS ONE OF THEM.  SO WE HAVE
DEMOBILIZATION, THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, AND ONUCA.  THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO THESE THREE TOPICS.

   THIS WAS NOT SO EASY.  SOME SAY THE THING TO DO IS TO CLEARLY AND
CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] FOR...[CHANGES THOUGHT] AND TO DESCRIBE IT AS A
TERRORIST GROUP.  OTHERS SAY: LET US CONDEMN TERRORISM IN GENERAL, AND
ALSO ANYONE WHO USES IT.  SOME ATTACH A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO
WHAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALIZING IN DEFENDING AND
PROMOTING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SAY, NAMELY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, AMERICA'S WATCH, THE GENEVA-BASED INTERNATIONAL
LEAGUE OF JURISTS, THE OAS' INTER-AMERICAN COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS,
THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, THE UN'S TASK FORCE ON FORCED
DISAPPEARANCES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CATHOLIC INSTITUTE IN
LONDON, ENGLAND.  ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE
NICARAGUAN STANDPOINT DESERVE RESPECT AND CREDIBILITY, INDICATE
MATTERS ARE NOT SIMPLY BLACK AND WHITE.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 10 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL LARIOS TODAY REJECTED THE CHRISTMAS
TRUCE PROPOSED BY SOME COUNTRIES AT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT AND
DEMANDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS END HOSTILITIES AS A PRIOR CONDITION FOR
THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED.

   THE MINISTER, WHO ALWAYS LABELED THE REBELS "TERRORISTS," SAID THAT
THIS "IS NOT THE TIME FOR TRUCES, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED
THAT THEY DO NOT WORK."  COSTA RICA PROPOSED A "CHRISTMAS TRUCE" TODAY
BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GUERRILLAS TO ALLEVIATE THE EXISTING
TENSION IN THE AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE HEIGHTENED FIGHTING IN EL
SALVADOR, WHICH HAS LEFT 2,000 DEAD IN THE PAST MONTH.

   LARIOS, HOWEVER, AGREED THAT THE DIALOGUE "CAN BEGIN" WITHOUT THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TURNING OVER ITS
WEAPONS BEFOREHAND.  "THE GUERRILLAS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO TURN
OVER THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BEGIN," LARIOS STATED.

   THE SALVADORAN GENERAL DENIED THAT THE FMLN CAN ESTABLISH ITSELF IN
CERTAIN "TERRITORIES" WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE HELD.  "THE FMLN
TERRORISTS ARE NOT IN ANY SPECIFIC PLACE," LARIOS STATED, AND THEN
NOTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL RECEIVE "GUARANTEES" FOR THEIR SAFETY
IF THEY END HOSTILITIES AND BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS "TO REJOIN POLITICAL
LIFE."

   LARIOS REJECTED THE FMLN CHARGES AGAINST RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS,
WHO IT ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING THE KILLING OF THE SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF WHOM WERE SPANIARDS, AND TWO WOMEN.

   MANAGUA, 20 MAR 89 -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] THE MURDER OF THREE
JOURNALISTS IN EL SALVADOR YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN SHOWS THE REPRESSIVE AND
CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THOSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR PRESS COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITH
ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMIES IN CHILE, PARAGUAY, AND OTHER MILITARY
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE SOMOZIST ARMY COMMITTED SIMILAR CRIMES IN NICARAGUA.  WE
JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COLD WAY IN WHICH U.S.  JOURNALIST BILL STEWART
WAS KILLED WHILE COVERING THE LAST PHASE OF THE INSURRECTION IN MANAGUA'S
WESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   IN EL SALVADOR, FOREIGN AND NATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARE DEMANDING A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION FROM PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO PUNISH THE MILITARY MEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.  WILL THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND BE WILLING TO
CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION?  WE DOUBT IT, BASED ON ITS LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO
RECTIFY THINGS IN THE PAST REGARDING OTHER CASES, SUCH AS THE ASSASSINATION
OF MSGR ROMERO AND THE MURDER OF HERBERT ANAYA, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS COMMISSION.  AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH NAPOLEON DUARTE'S
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTRAINS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN HIS
COUNTRY.  MORE THAN 11 JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY
SINCE 1981.  

   MEANWHILE, IN NICARAGUA, JOURNALISTS FROM INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT 39 FORMER SOMOZIST GUARDS WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR
CRIMINAL RECORDS, TO THE POINT OF LAUNCHING JOURNALISTIC CAMPAIGNS DEMANDING
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE RELEASE OF THE HARMLESS PIGEONS.

   WHAT WILL THEY SAY NOW ABOUT THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH MURDERED THEIR
COLLEAGUES WHO WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR DUTY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC?  WILL
THEY DEFEND THEM AS THEY DEFENDED THE SOMOZIST GUARDS?  THEY PROBABLY WILL.
THEY WILL TRY TO PLAY DOWN THE ACTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR DIGNITY,
GOOD SENSE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRIDE A LONG TIME AGO.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 11 DEC 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH LIEUTENANT COLONEL RICARDO WHEELOCK, CHIEF OF THE NICARAGUAN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[WHEELOCK] I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE.  THIS MORNING WE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY [EPS] HAD BOMBED AND
SANK SEVERAL HONDURAN BOATS.  WE MEAN CIVILIAN FISHING BOATS.  I WILL
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

   WE HAVE VERY FEW PATROL BOATS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND OUR BOATS
THERE ARE IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING NICARAGUA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WEALTH.
FOR MANY YEARS, THE NICARAGUAN AIR FORCE AND THE SANDINIST NAVY HAVE
BEEN CONDUCTING JOINT OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST TIME WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH OPERATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE
TAPED MOST OF THOSE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THOROUGH TRAINING
AND ACCURACY.

   DURING THOSE OPERATIONS, HELICOPTERS HAVE DEPLOYED MEN WHO BOARD
MOST OF THE SHIPS PARTICIPATING IN THE OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
HELICOPTERS FOLLOW THE SHIPS AS THEY MOVE ALONG AND THEN SPECIAL
SANDINIST NAVY FORCES BOARD THE SHIP FROM THE AIR.

   I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED MORE OR LESS.  ON 7 DECEMBER 1989 WE
CONDUCTED AN OPERATION, BASICALLY BECAUSE SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE
DETECTED OVER 30 PIRATE SHIPS, IN OTHER WORDS, SHIPS THAT HAVE NEITHER
LICENSE NOR PERMIT TO FISH IN NICARAGUAN TERRITORIAL WATERS.

   DURING AN OPERATION OF THE TYPE I JUST DESCRIBED, OUR FORCES
BOARDED THREE BOATS AT 1020 ON 7 DECEMBER.  THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED
OUT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES EAST OF PUERTO CABEZAS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
THE THREE BOATS WERE BOARDED IN THIS AREA HERE.  [WHEELOCK APPARENTLY
SHOWS LOCATION ON A MAP].

   THE NAMES OF THE BOATS ARE "KERRY MAC II", "DAVIS JR," "MISS
PATSY," AND ANOTHER ONE CALLED "TIE WATER" [NUMBER OF BOATS AS
HEARD].  THE BOATS WERE CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ.  IN EACH
BOAT THERE WERE FIVE NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS, ONE AIR FORCE OFFICER, AND
ONE NAVY OFFICER.  AS THE BOATS WERE TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE
MEMBERS OF THE "MISS PATSY" CREW, WHO NUMBERED APPROXIMATELY 60,
MUTINIED AGAINST THE SANDINIST OFFICERS ON BOARD.

   THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN AND A COOK DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS AND
KILLED HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE COOK WAS KILLED,
BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS UNHARMED.  AFTER THE MUTINY WAS OVER, AND AT
APPROXIMATELY 0.7 MILES FROM CORN, I MEAN ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE SHIP'S
CAPTAIN RAN THE "MISS PATSY" FISHING BOAT AGROUND ON SOME REEF NEAR
ISLA DEL MAIZ GRANDE AND WE WERE FORCED TO, LET US SAY, SAVE ALL THE
PEOPLE ON BOARD AND TAKE THEM TO CORN ISLAND.

   ONE OF THE "MISS PATSY" SAILORS JUMPED OFF THE SHIP AND WE HAVE
BEEN UNABLE TO FIND HIM.  OF THE TWO BODIES, THAT OF THE ARMY OFFICER
AND THE COOK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE COOK'S BODY
BECAUSE THE SHIP SANK.  MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO
HOSPITALS IN BLUEFIELDS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE SANDINIST
NAVY.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.

   WHEN THE "MISS PATSY" RAN AGROUND, THE CREW MEMBERS OF THE OTHER
SHIPS CAME TO HELP, AND DURING THIS TIME, APPARENTLY, THE SHIP CALLED
"DAVIS JR" MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT, BUT WE
WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE FOLLOWING EPS OFFICERS ARE ON THAT BOAT: AIR
FORCE FIRST LIEUTENANT VICTOR RODRIGUEZ HERNANDEZ, LT JUAN CARLOS GALO
TINOCO, NAVY SAILOR JOSE MARCELINO REYES, AND SAILOR JOSE RENE
RODRIGUEZ.

   WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE "DAVIS JR," BUT WE BELIEVE IT
RETURNED TO HONDURAS.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.  I AM NOW
READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASK.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN], WITH REGARD TO THE
RESULTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS,
REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTS' MEETING HAS ALLOWED US TO
MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR AND THE IMPACT OF THE
FMLN'S CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, INASMUCH AS THE SUMMIT'S ENTIRE
EFFORT WAS AIMED AT SAVING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FROM AN EXTREME
POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS AND FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION IN
EXCHANGE FOR A NEW PROMISE ON THE IMMEDIATE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS.

   2.  THE FMLN INDIGNANTLY REJECTS THE PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION
BECAUSE, CONTRARY TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, THE CLAMOR OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE CLAMOR
OF CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, THIS DECLARATION UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTS
THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT
HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION. THIS SUPPORT ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THAT
IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND ALLOWS MORE MURDERS IN EL SALVADOR.

   3.  THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN CANNOT BE DISBANDED AS THE RESULT OF
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE FMLN CONSTITUTES A
GENUINELY POPULAR POWER THROUGHOUT THE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, A FORCE
THAT THE HUGE U.S.-FINANCED WAR MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN
10 YEARS.

   4. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE, THE FMLN AGREES WITH UN
SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ' MEDIATION TO INITIATE SERIOUS
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL FORCES.

   5. WE ARE HEREBY CALLING FOR INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY SO OTHER
COUNTRIES CAN MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE,
WHO ARE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM AN ESCALATION IN EFFORTS TO
EXTERMINATE IT BECAUSE THE FASCIST POLICY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE
SUPPORT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION OFFERS TO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR AND
REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] IN THE CASE OF EL SALVADOR,
THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THE IRREGULAR GROUP BEING AROUND SAN SALVADOR,
IN GUASAPA, OR IN CHALATENANGO -- WHEREVER THEY MAY WANT TO OPERATE.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS IS APPLICABLE IF THE GROUP
CEASES TO BE AN IRREGULAR GROUP, SOMETHING THAT NO LONGER HAS ANY
JUSTIFICATION, TO BECOME A POLITICAL OR A CIVIC GROUP IN THE FRAMEWORK
OF A LEGAL PROCESS.

   THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER WANT OR JUSTIFY
IRREGULAR GROUPS IN THE REGION, AND IRREGULAR GROUPS HAVE NO REASON
FOR CONTINUING IN THE REGION.  THIS INCLUDES THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE, THE FMLN, AND OTHER GROUPS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY EXIST
IN GUATEMALA.  IF GUATEMALA WERE TO ASK THAT A PROBLEM IN THAT SISTER
COUNTRY BE CONSIDERED, WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IT BECAUSE IT IS THE
SAME SITUATION.

   SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS IS
REQUESTED THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS CIAV.  THE FIRST THING TO
DO IS TO CEASE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, TO INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
AND THEN TO BE DEMOBILIZED AND TO BECOME A LEGAL GROUP THAT WOULD
FUNCTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SALVADORAN LAWS.

   [MODERATOR] MARIA DOLORES ARGUIAQ, FROM RADIO NACIONAL, SPAIN.

   [ARGUIAQ] CONTINUING WITH THE NICARAGUA PARALLELISM, IS THERE THE
POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A CEASE-FIRE BEFORE OR AFTER THE VENEZUELA
MEETING AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD OTHER MEASURES THAT COULD PUT AN END TO
THE WAR?  MY OTHER QUESTION IS: THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY
ASKED TO PREPARE THE REINITIATION OF THE DIALOGUE.  HAS THERE BEEN ANY
PREPARATION?  HAS THE CHURCH MADE ANY PREPARATIONS IN THIS REGARD?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, [1-MINUTE BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.  AN END OF HOSTILITIES IS BASICALLY LIKE SAYING: DO
NOT CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
IT IS BETTER TO DEFINE MEANINGS AND NOT TO USE TERMS THAT CREATE
PROBLEMS OF SEMANTICS.  WHAT IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION?

   [ARGUIAQ] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] LOGICALLY.  SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ASKED ME ALSO IF WE HAVE
HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE FMLN.  THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AT 0400.  AT
0700 WE GOT ON A PLANE AND HERE WE ARE NOW.  WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO
SPEAK WITH MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR, MUCH LESS WITH THE FMLN.  BUT THIS
INFORMATION WILL BE PASSED TO THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH
TO BE ASKED OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THE
PLEASANT SURPRISE THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN
CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA] ARE ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY, TO BE INSTALLED.

   MR ORTEGA, WHO HAD GONE THERE WITH THE POSITION THAT AS LONG AS THE
RESISTANCE IS NOT DEMOBILIZED HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT ONUCA, HAD TO
ABANDON THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT WAS IRRATIONAL, AND ONUCA WILL BE
ASKED TO GO TO NICARAGUA IMMEDIATELY.

   THE AGREEMENT WILL BE REPORTED TO MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  HE
WILL ALSO RECEIVE FROM EL SALVADOR A REQUEST THAT HE WORK IN FAVOR OF
REINITIATING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE AGREEMENT HAS SPECIAL
CONTENTS.  IT DOES NOT MENTION OTHER COUNTRIES BY NAME BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE TRIED TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT THAT IS
VERY RESPECTFUL OF COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE THIS AREA, BUT IT IS
UNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE
SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL, ESPECIALLY AND PERSONALLY, ARE BEING ASKED TO HELP MAKE
STATES THAT MEDDLE IN THE REGION SEE THAT THEY MUST HELP THE PEACE
PROCESS PROMOTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

   OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT HAVE TO MENTION THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES TO
WHICH I AM REFERRING.

   IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A REAL
SOLUTION, TO SEE THAT ALL THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXERTING
INFLUENCE, WHETHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, WORK IN A POSITIVE WAY.  THE
UNITED NATIONS, WHICH COMPRISES ALL THESE STATES, IS IN A BETTER
POSITION TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK.  


DEV-MUC3-0973 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] ON RETURNING TODAY
FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT HELD IN COSTA RICA, SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE TERRORIST ACTIONS OF THE
GUERRILLAS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW."

   PLEASED WITH THE POLITICAL SUPPORT HE OBTAINED FROM HIS COLLEAGUES
INCLUDING NICARAGUA'S DANIEL ORTEGA, CRISTIANI SAID IN A NEWS
CONFERENCE THAT HE WILL IMMEDIATELY RESUME THE DIALOGUE WITH THE
GUERRILLAS "AS SOON AS THE GUERRILLAS CEASE HOSTILITIES AND PUBLICLY
GIVE UP COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT "IN THE SUMMIT THERE WAS A
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THAT THE PRESIDENTS CALLED THE GUERRILLAS BY
THEIR NAMES."

   CRISTIANI FEELS THAT THE "TERRORIST ACTIONS" OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ARE NOT JUSTIFIED, AND THAT THE
GUERRILLAS "ARE PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT THAT IS ONLY CAPABLE
OF GENERATING TERRORISM."  IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE,
THE GUERRILLAS COULD NOT SURVIVE, HE ADDED.

   BEFORE CRISTIANI HAD FINISHED HIS NEWS CONFERENCE, THE FMLN
"ANGRILY" REACTED WHEN IT LEARNED OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE
PRESIDENTS IN COSTA RICA WHO ASKED FOR THEIR "DEMOBILIZATION."

   THE PRESIDENTS ALSO ASKED THE FMLN TO "PUBLICLY GIVE UP COMMITTING
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION," AND TO "REJOIN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS" THAT WAS SUSPENDED 2
MONTHS AGO.

   THE GUERRILLAS ACCUSE THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT OF BEING
"THE MAIN VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS" AND STATED THAT THE COSTA RICA
AGREEMENT "ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THIS
IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND IT ALLOWS FOR AN EVEN GREATER SLAUGHTER IN EL
SALVADOR."

   POLICE SOURCES CONSULTED BY ACAN - EFE AGREED THAT THE UNITED
NATIONS SHOULD NOW ASSUME A "GREATER RESPONSIBILITY" AND SEEK A
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED CONFLICT THAT HAS LEFT OVER 70,000
DEAD IN 10 YEARS OF WAR IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.


DEV-MUC3-0974 (SRI)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS
CONFERENCE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] ... HE
[ORTEGA] WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO
IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT
HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE
COMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE
DEFENSE.

   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT
THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF
TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.
THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN
POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.  HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT ACCEPT THE
REALITY.  HE COULD NO LONGER DEFEND THE POSITION THAT THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND WAS JUSTIFIABLE.  IT
IS NOW CLEAR THAT HE HAS RUN OUT OF TRICKS AND HAS HAD TO ACCEPT WHAT
ALL THE REMAINING FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF AND
DEFENDED AT THE COSTA RICAN SUMMIT.  NOW, IF IN THEIR STRATEGY THEY
SOLD OUT THE FMLN, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE, THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE
SOME EXPLANATIONS TO THEIR FMLN FRIENDS.  THAT IS A PROBLEM BETWEEN
HIM AND THE FMLN.

   WHAT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO US IS THAT THE FMLN'S VIOLENT AND
TERRORIST ACTIONS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW.
THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY AND STRONGLY EMPHASIZED IN THE COSTA RICAN
AGREEMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS
WILLING TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE PROCESS FROM WHICH THE FMLN
UNILATERALLY WITHDREW.  HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE
FMLN TO OPENLY PROMISE -- AND THIS IS STRONGLY DEMANDED BY THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT -- IT WILL
CEASE TERRORIST ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTING CIVILIANS.
OBVIOUSLY A TOTAL DEMOBILIZATION AND RETURN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
-- WITH THE GUARANTEES THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FMLN MEMBERS -- WILL
BE THE RESULT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THIS IS HOW WE UNDERSTAND AND
VIEW THIS MATTER.  THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE
SHALL BE THE RESULT OF A CONVINCING EFFORT BY THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES.  IN THE
SAME DOCUMENT, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS UNILATERALLY VOWED TO
ENSURE THOSE GUARANTEES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
ASKED THE UNITED NATIONS TO ALSO JOIN THE CIAV [INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF
SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION], SO THE CIAV BEGINS AND IMPLEMENTS THE PROCESS TO
DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN. THIS IS BASICALLY THE DESIRE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS.  IF THE FMLN WANTS TO GAIN POLITICAL ADVANTAGES, IT SHOULD
PURSUE THIS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE IT CAN NO LONGER BE
JUSTIFIED AND HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTIFIED.  HOWEVER, TODAY WE STRONGLY TELL THE
FMLN THAT NO LONGER IS THERE ANY ROOM IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY IN
EL SALVADOR, FOR VIOLENT AND TERRORIST ACTIONS.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR
AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, AS I SAID BEFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE
DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS BEING DISCUSSED FOR ANY REBEL ORGANIZATION
SHOULD BE A COMPLETE PROCESS WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.  IT IS A PROCESS THAT IS ADAPTED TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AN
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IS IN CHARGE OF VERIFYING THIS PROCESS. WE
BELIEVE THE ORGANIZATION HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO DO IT, AND IT
SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY DO
NOT EXIST.  WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES THE ONES THAT HAVE
ALREADY BEEN DESIGNED FOR BOTH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE AND FOR THE
FMLN, SPECIFICALLY.  IN GENERAL TERMS THESE OPTIONS COULD BE APPLIED
TO ANY REBEL GROUP IN THE REGION.

   [MODERATOR] LUIS FUENTES FROM PRENSA GRAFICA.  [PAUSE] CARLOS
ERNESTO RUGAMA FROM RADIO CADENA YSU.

   [RUGAMA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] ...DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA.  HOW CAN THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE RELATIONS BE ACHIEVED?

   [CRISTIANI] POINT 12 OF THIS DECLARATION MAKES A FRATERNAL CALL TO
EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA TO SEEK THE NORMALIZATION OF THE DIPLOMATIC
AND CONSULAR RELATIONS THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS.  WE MADE THE
DECISION TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BECAUSE
OF THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS.  THEY WERE
DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN'S TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  IN COSTA RICA WE
GAVE THEM A DOCUMENT THAT CLEARLY DEFINES EL SALVADOR'S POSITION
REGARDING POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH COULD NORMALLY REESTABLISH THE
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS.  THIS DOCUMENT WAS NOT DISCUSSED BY
THE FIVE PRESIDENTS BECAUSE IT ONLY CONCERNED TWO OF US.  HOWEVER, THE
DOCUMENT WAS GIVEN TO THE NICARAGUAN DELEGATION AND WE WILL WAIT FOR
THE RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS IT COULD STOP
NICARAGUA'S INTERFERENCE AND ITS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN.

   [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA FROM NOTIMEX.

    CORTINA WORDS INDISTINCT ...TO IMMEDIATELY INITIATE THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE TO PUBLICLY STOP CONDUCTING ACTIONS
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THAT WAS PART OF THE PROPOSAL YOU
MADE HERE ON SATURDAY.  HOWEVER, I AM NOT YET CLEAR ON SOMETHING.  TO
INITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, DOES THE FMLN HAVE TO DECLARE A
CEASE-FIRE OR WOULD A PUBLIC DECLARATION BE ENOUGH?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE STATED ON 10 DECEMBER.  WE
BELIEVE THAT POINT 3 OF THIS DECLARATION UPHOLDS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ALL
ALONG REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WANT THE FMLN TO PUBLICLY STATE
THAT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT.  THEY MUST KEEP THEIR WORD.  WE BELIEVE
THAT THERE SHOULD AT LEAST BE A 5-DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE PUBLIC STATEMENT
AND THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE.  WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION, THAT IS THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND MYSELF, THAT NO HOSTILE ACTIONS BY THE FMLN
ARE JUSTIFIABLE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD STOP CARRYING OUT ALL
HOSTILE ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.  THIS INDICATES TWO THINGS WHICH MUST BE
UNDERSTOOD.  FIRST, THE FMLN ARE THE ONLY ONES CONDUCTING HOSTILE ACTIONS.
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT BELONG TO IT DO NOT
GENERATE HOSTILITIES.  THEY SIMPLY RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS OF ARMED GROUPS
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING TROUBLE AND OVERTHROWING A LEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE
DEFENSE AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN FAVOR OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES.  SECONDLY, THE FMLN HAS LOST
ALL MANEUVERING OPTIONS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID IT CLEARLY
WHEN THEY STATED THAT THE FMLN HAD NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIOLENT
ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR AN
IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.  THESE WERE THE SAME WORDS USED AT THE
SUMMIT HELD IN TELA, HONDURAS.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL MAINTAIN THE
POSITION WE HAD BEFORE, EVEN THOUGH WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS DOCUMENT.

   BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A COLOMBIAN OFFICIAL FROM THE
INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK [IDB] AND A PROSECUTOR FROM THE

THIS NORTHWESTERN CITY, THE SECOND LARGEST IN COLOMBIA, POLICE
SPOKESMEN HAVE REPORTED.

   EDGAR HENAO, 55, CIVIL ENGINEER, ECONOMIST, AND TOP EXECUTIVE FROM
THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT ORGANIZATION, WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES BY SOME
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE AT HIS FARM CALLED EL LIMON, VENECIA MUNICIPALITY,
61 KM SOUTHWEST OF MEDELLIN.

   HENAO, WHO HAS BEEN WORKING FOR THE IDB FOR 13 YEARS, HAD ARRIVED

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 12 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS
BOMBING THE AREA SURROUNDING A VOLCANO NEAR THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT, "THREATENING THE LIVES AND SECURITY OF SALVADORANS."

   IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION ADDRESS TO NICARAGUANS TO EXPLAIN THE
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA -- WHERE
THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS HELD -- ORTEGA POINTED OUT THAT
THESE BOMBINGS "ARE AGAINST THE AGREEMENTS" WHICH WERE RECENTLY
SIGNED.

   "THE BOMBS THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS LAUNCHING DO NOT HELP AT ALL IN
COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA,"
PRESIDENT ORTEGA, WHO SPOKE CALMLY, WARNED.  ORTEGA APPEALED TO THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO CEASE THE BOMBINGS.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED ON THE "GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
"CONTRAS" STATIONED IN HONDURAS.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES FINANCES THE "CONTRAS" AND
THEREFORE WASHINGTON HAS IN ITS HANDS [THE POSSIBILITY] OF
"GIVING SOME TRANQUILITY TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   "THIS IS NOW A DEMAND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES, WHICH WAS
RATIFIED AT THE (COSTA RICA) MEETING," ORTEGA ADDED.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE DEADLINE TO DEMOBILIZE THE REBELS ENDED ON
5 DECEMBER AND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE WAS TO OPPOSE THE
DISBANDING OF THE "CONTRAS."

   ORTEGA STATED: "THUS, I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS AND STOP DISRESPECTING THE RESOLVE
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLES WHO WANT PEACE."

   ORTEGA TRUSTS THAT WITH THE UN SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY
12,000 CONTRAS STATIONED IN HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TO SEEK A
SOLUTION TO AN OVER 10-YEAR-LONG WAR.

   ORTEGA ADMITTED THAT HE GETS WORRIED EVERY TIME HE ATTENDS A
SUMMIT, BECAUSE THESE MEETINGS "ARE HELD UNDER U.S. PRESSURE," BUT
FINALLY "WE REACHED AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS."

   ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, THE PEACE PLANS SIGNED BY THE AREA PRESIDENTS
"HAVE HAD A GOOD EFFECT IN NICARAGUA," BUT HE WARNED THAT HE COULD NOT
SAY THE SAME FOR EL SALVADOR, "WITH WHICH WE CANNOT BE PLEASED YET."

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR
AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] AND AGAIN, BECAUSE THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DID NOT WANT TO STATE THESE COUNTRIES BY
NAME, I WILL REFRAIN MYSELF FROM DOING IT AT THIS TIME, BUT THEY ARE
VERY OBVIOUS, WHO AND WHAT THEY [WORD INDISTINCT].

   BUT I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF THE FMLN WOULD ACT
RATIONALLY AND ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY RECOGNITION FOR
WHAT THEY DO, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED, AND NOT ONLY AS AN
IRREGULAR FORCE OR GROUP.  THEY HAVE NOW BEEN CONDEMNED AS BEING A
TERRORIST GROUP, WHICH IS THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE THIRD POINT IN THE
AGREEMENT.  THEREFORE, MAYBE THEY SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.  MAYBE THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, WHOSE ANNIVERSARY WE
CELEBRATE TODAY, AND WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF ALL THE AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, WILL SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE IRRATIONAL PEOPLE.  THEY
MIGHT SEE THIS AS A VERY CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER JUSTIFY OR
LIE, OR TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WHAT THEY DO IS GOOD.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] THAT IS NOT WHAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR.  THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM AND ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED IN THAT WAY.

   [MODERATOR] ANA ARANDA FROM THE MIAMI HERALD.

   [ARANDA, IN ENGLISH] [WORDS INDISTINCT] IF THE GOVERNMENT AT ANY
POINT CONFRONTED NICARAGUA OR [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT AS SUCH WAS TRULY INVOLVED IN SENDING WEAPONS TO THE FMLN?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, HE WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE
VIDEOTAPES THAT I TOOK.  WE WERE WATCHING THEM WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, HE SAID HE HAD SOME
TELEPHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND HE GOT UP AND LEFT.  OBVIOUSLY HE COULD
NOT JUSTIFY WHAT HE WAS SEEING AND WHAT THE OTHER PRESIDENTS WERE
WITNESSING THERE ON THE TV SCREEN.

   THERE WAS SOME CONFRONTATION WITH ORTEGA OBVIOUSLY, BUT I WILL, YOU
KNOW, WILL SAY THAT I DID NOT MIND WHERE THE WAREHOUSE WAS OR WHERE
THEY COME FROM.  IT IS SIMPLY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT SOME POINT IN
TIME IN NICARAGUA AND NICARAGUA WAS SENDING THEM OVER TO EL SALVADOR.
WHETHER THEY CAME FROM THE SOVIET UNION OR WHETHER THEY BOUGHT THEM
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM, IT REALLY MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE.  WITHIN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT THEY ARE COMING THROUGH NICARAGUA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, AND THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WHAT COULD HE SAY?  NO, HE CAME OUT TRYING
TO PRODUCE SOME SORT OF DUST OVER THE ISSUE -- LIKE WE CALL IT HERE --
THROUGH HIS MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.  HE WAS ACCUSING COSTA RICA
OF SENDING AID TO THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE.  AND MAYBE HE THOUGHT TO
DIVERT THE ATTENTION FROM THE SALVADORAN CASE BY TRYING TO SAY THAT
COSTA RICA WAS SENDING WEAPONS TO THE
 NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE.  THEN OBVIOUSLY HE ACCUSED EVERYBODY OF
SENDING WEAPONS TO NICARAGUA.

   THE POINT IS, FIRST OF ALL, HE DID NOT CONVINCE ANY OF THE OTHER
FOUR PRESIDENTS.  THAT IS FOR SURE.  AND THERE WERE NO ARGUMENTS HE
MADE IN FRONT OF THE PRESS OR AT ANY POINT IN TIME WHERE THEY DENIED
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING THE FMLN.  I MEAN, IT IS VERY CLEAR AND
OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE HELPED THE FMLN NOT SINCE NOVEMBER 11.  ALL THE
WEAPONS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE BY NOVEMBER 11 ALSO CAME THROUGH
NICARAGUA.

   [MODERATOR] RICARDO CLEMENS FROM VISNEWS.

   [CLEMENS, IN SPANISH] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CASE OF JENNIFER CASOLO
THERE WAS A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT VERY CLEAR AND
THERE IS SOME KIND OF IMPASSE REGARDING HER TRIAL.  WILL THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH HELP TO ACCELERATE THE TRIAL, OR WILL IT ISSUE SOME KIND OF
PARDON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] NO, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CANNOT INTERFERE
WITH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS OF ANY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY.  IT WOULD HAVE
TO BE THE SUPREME COURT OR THE JUDICIARY THAT DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM.
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE LAW IS AND WHAT THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAW SHOULD BE.  OUR POSITION IS THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE APPLIED
IMPARTIALLY, AND EVERYTHING THAT THE JUDGE OR ANYBODY ELSE DOES IN THE
STATE SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

   BUT WE HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF INTERVENING IN THE JUDICIARY PROCESS.
THERE IS A SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE
JUDICIAL BRANCH.

   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.  THANK YOU ALL.

   SAN SALVADOR, 13 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES TODAY DENIED CHARGES BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA THAT
THE AIR FORCE "LAST NIGHT BOMBED AREAS NEAR SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO,
ENDANGERING THE LIVES AND SECURITY" OF CIVIIANS.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE SAID: "IT IS
FALSE. WE ARE NOT BOMBING."

   HE EXPLAINED THAT "SOME EXPLOSIONS" HEARD LAST NIGHT ON THE SLOPES
OF THE VOLCANO WERE FLARES FIRED "TO POINT OUT" TO ARMY UNITS ON LAND
"AREAS WHERE GUERILLA COLUMNS WERE MOVING."

   HE SAID: "THE FLARES WERE LAUNCHED FROM HELICOPTERS, AND AT NO TIME
DID WE BOMB POPULATED AREAS."

   ACCORDING TO THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE
"BOMBINGS CONTRADICT THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED YESTERDAY (12 DECEMBER)
IN COSTA RICA," IN WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ASKED THE
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TO END
HOSTILITIES.

   BOGOTA, 12 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] BRITISH ENGINEER JOHN MARCK JONES
[NAME AS RECEIVED], KIDNAPPED BY THE MARXIST-LENINIST NATIONAL
LIBERATION ARMY [ELN], RESIDES IN COLOMBIA AND BOTH HIS WIFE AND TWO
CHILDREN ARE COLOMBIANS, IT WAS OFICIALLY REPORTED TODAY.

   JONES, 45, WHO WAS REPORTED MISSING IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT IN
COLOMBIA'S NORTHEAST EARLY ON 11 DECEMBER, IS THE OWNER OF ALTA
TENSION DE COLOMBIA, A POWER COMPANY.

   JONES' RELATIVES TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS THAT, DESPITE THE INITIAL
REPORTS, THE BRITISH ENGINEER DOES NOT WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATION.

   IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ELN MISTOOK HIM FOR THE EMPLOYEE OF SOME
FOREIGN COMPANY AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE PLANNING TO DEMAND A RANSOM.

   JONES WAS TAKEN IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF THE CATATUMBO OIL BASIN,
NEAR THE BORDER WITH VENEZUELA, WHILE DRIVING WITH TWO FELLOW WORKERS,
WHO WERE NOT DETAINED.

   THESE MEN TOLD THE COLOMBIAN POLICE THAT THE KIDNAPPERS IDENTIFIED
THEMSELVES AS ELN MEMBERS AND THAT THEY TOOK THE ENGINEER WHEN THEY
CONFIRMED HE WAS A FOREIGNER.

   JONES' POWER COMPANY BUILDS POWER SUBSTATIONS IN OIL CAMPS IN THE
AREA WHERE HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

   A POLICE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT A SPECIALIZED AGENCY, WHICH IS
INVESTIGATING THE KIDNAPPING, IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE ENGINEER'S
WHEREABOUTS.

   THE ELN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF KIDNAPPINGS AND EXTORTION AGAINST OIL
GROUPS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMBERS, AND ENGINEERS.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 13 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH]
[NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] ....I WAS IN SAN JOSE,
COSTA RICA AT A MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THIS MEETING
WAS OF URGENT NATURE TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA,
THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

   AT THIS MEETING, WE HELD IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE
BEING EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE
SITUATION BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEIGHBORING EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS
FACING AN INTERNAL CONFLICT -- MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONTINUED WAR AND
INTERNAL CONFLICT.  EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A VERY STRONG
CONFRONTATION, WHICH LATELY HAS WORSENED.  AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THE CLERGY, NUNS, AND UNION AND LABOR LEADERS
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION.  AT THIS MEETING,
NICARAGUA STATED ITS POSITION THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR MUST
BE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND NOT BY WAY OF VIOLENCE.  THIS
POSITION FULLY COINCIDES WITH THE POSITION THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS DEFENDED.  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS
THE FMLN HAS MADE PEACE PROPOSALS AND IT HAS CALLED FOR NEGOTIATED
SOLUTIONS TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS.

   FOLLOWING A LENGTHY AND INTENSE DISCUSSION OF THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,
WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO GENERAL PLEASE AND
STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN THE NEIGHBORING CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRY, BUT ON VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT COULD LEAD TO
SOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THUS, IN POINT THREE, THE FIVE
PRESIDENTS DECIDED TO REQUEST THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKE A
VERY SPECIAL PERSONAL EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE
TALKS' SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT.

   NICARAGUA HAS THUS SUPPORTED THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION THE FMLN HAS
VIGOROUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY CALLED FOR, AND WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO CLAIMS TO AGREE.  SUCH NEGOTIATION
WOULD LEAD TO A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT WOULD RESULTE IN SOLVING THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  LIKEWISE, WE UNDERSCORED HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATED IN CERTAIN
COUNTRIES.  THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED AT INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS.  I AM ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WERE RECENTLY
MURDERED, AND WHERE THE ARMY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EXERTING
INDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE, THROUGH AERIAL AS WELL
AS ARTILLERY AND INFANTRY ATTACKS.

   THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IS WORRISOME TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEOPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY TO NICARAGUA.  WE
ALSO REACHED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS RATIFIED
THEIR PLEDGES TO FULLY RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CIVILIAN,
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, AND IN SIGNED AND RATIFIED INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS.

   NICARAGUA'S POSITION HAS NOT WAVERED; IT HAS MAINTAINED ITS
POSITIONS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO HAVE
RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AND HELP DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.  THERE ARE FORCES, CENTRAL AMERICAN ARMIES ESPECIALLY, AMONG
THEM THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS ORGANIZED DEATH SQUADS THAT
SYSTEMATICALLY MURDER SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- WHOSE GOVERNMENTS AND
PRESIDENTS ARE FACED WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN OVERCOMING THE
PROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THIS, I BELIEVE, IS WHERE THE
GREATEST STRENGTH MUST BE EXERTED AND THE GREATEST EFFORT MADE TO
DISBAND THE DEATH SQUADS SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE RESPECTED, A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND FOR ALL THE CONFLICTS IN THESE
COUNTRIES, AND A WORSENING OF VIOLENCE CAN BE AVOIDED, ESPECIALLY
SINCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE THAT
PREVAILS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO A LACK OF EQUITY, FREEDOM, AND
JUSTICE, WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO NUEVO MUNDO) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO
CEREZO HAS REFERRED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT
REPRESENTATIVES AND MEMBERS OF THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY,
URNG, CLEARLY STATING THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE WITH THAT
ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSED.  HE ADDED THAT THE URNG MUST FIRST STATE
THAT IT IS WILLING TO PEACEFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE.

   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT ADDED THAT THE REBELS MUST UNDERSTAND THA
THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT DIALOGUE WHEN PERPETRATING ACTS OF TREASON
AGAINST THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, MEANING PLACING BOMBS AND
PERPETRATING ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THE URNG MUST DECIDE TO SUSPEND ITS
TERRORIST ACTIONS IF IT WANTS TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, HE SAID.  CEREZO
ADDED THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THE IDEOLOGIES IN
GUATEMALA.

   CEREZO AREVALO ADDED THAT IF THE URNG MEMBERS WISH TO HOLD A
DIALOGUE, THEY MAY DO SO.  IN FACT, HE SAID, IF THEY WANT TO RETURN TO
THE COUNTRY WE CAN DISCUSS THE SECURITY CONDITIONS -- BUT THEY MUST
PUBLICLY STATE THEIR DECISION TO RETURN IN PEACE.  OTHERWISE, THE
PRESIDENT ADDED, IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO GIVING
 THE OTHER, RIGHT-WING, TERRORISTS, WHO ATTACK STUDENTS, ENGAGE IN       
KIDNAPPING, AND PLACE BOMBS, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNAL     
DIALOGUE.  THE URNG MUST DECIDE IF IT WANTS TO JOIN US.  THEY MUST DO
IT PEACEFULLY BECAUSE THAT IS THE PROPER THING. THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP
WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR, HE SAID.

   PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO REFERRED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PARLIAMENT'S FUTURE DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD AT THE GUATEMALAN
AIR FORCE'S INSTALLATIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO THE COUNTRY FROM COSTA
RICA.  HE SAID THAT THE SAN ISIDRO DECLARATION SIGNED BY THE FIVE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS INCLUDED TWO IMPRESSIVE DECISIONS.  HE
SAID THAT THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT
-- EACH COUNTRY MAY DECIDE ON ITS CONTRIBUTION AS IT SEES FIT -- A
SUBJECT WHICH HAD DELAYED THE SIGNATURE OF THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS.
IN ADDITION, THE ECOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION WILL BEGIN TO
OPERATE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT ITS EFFORTS WILL HELP CONSOLIDATE
PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN THE AREA.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 13 DEC 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN RICARDO MONTENEGRO, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN "RADIO VENCEREMOS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE," BY
JORGE LUIS BERNARD] [TEXT] [BERNARD] MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] WILL
CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED?

   [MONTENEGRO] THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN BEGAN ITS
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL.  THUS, THE FMLN
CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE.  ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL
SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR.
THAT TURN INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND DIPLOMATIC
IMPLICATIONS.

   THUS, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN SAN ISIDRO DE
CORONADO DID NOT PROPOSE REALISTIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONFLICT.
YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY
EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT
THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN
EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN
RIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A
PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN.

   [BERNARD] IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME
LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?

   [MONTENEGRO] I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE
LEGITIMATE THAN EVER.  THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE
FMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS
NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.  THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS
POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.  THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.
THE FMLN IS REORGANIZING [READECUAR] ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY
APPARATUS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN
CAN DO.  THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.  THE
FMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT
THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.

   IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO
WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM.

   [BERNARD] TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT,
WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

   [MONTENEGRO] AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION,
THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN
14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN
AHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST
UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR.

   THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS 65
PERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS
ABANDONED LARGE AREAS.

   AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT
PRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE.  THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT
ENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY.  THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF
100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT
THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG
THEY WILL ENDURE IT.  BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN
FORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.

DEV-MUC3-0984 (SRI)

   CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] WE COULD SAY THAT TO A GREAT EXTENT THE DECLARATION IS FULL OF
PRETTY WORDS, SIMILAR TO THOSE CRISTIANI USES, IN THE PARTS WHERE THE
DECLARATION CALLS ON THE FMLN TO JOIN THE ALLEGED DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND
SAYS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS LEGITIMATE.  HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK
CAREFULLY, WE CAN SEE WHAT IS BEHIND THE WORDS AND THAT IN ADDITION TO
DECLARING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY A FAVOR.  THIS IS DONE BY ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP ALL
VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

   WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT REFERS TO SIEGES ON CITIES,
TO TRANSPORTATION STRIKES, AND TO SABOTAGE, THE ARMY'S MOST SERIOUS
SOURCES OF CONCERN.  UNDERNEATH THIS DECLARATION IS A REQUEST FOR THE
FMLN TO LEAVE THE CITIES BECAUSE THE ARMY CAN NO LONGER STAND THE
SITUATION AND FEELS IT IS NEAR COLLAPSE.

   THE DECLARATION DOES NOT STATE ANY CONCERN FOR BOMBINGS BECAUSE
CONSIDERING THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW, ANY
STATEMENT IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE LIKE ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE.  THE
DECLARATION IS LIKE A WALKING STICK TO KEEP THE DICTATORSHIP UP, AND,
AS THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN A COMMUNIQUE, IT IS EVIDENCE
OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS IN WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
PLACED AS A RESULT OF THE OFFENSIVE CARRIED OUT BY ALL OF YOU.

   TO CONCLUDE: LET US WAIT AND SEE IF THIS DECLARATION WILL SAVE
CRISTIANI FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION WHAT THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS STATED IN ITS COMMUNIQUE,
THAT THE AGREEMENTS BY GOVERNMENTS THAT DO NOT KNOW THE TRUE SITUATION
IN OUR COUNTRY AND THAT SERVE OTHER INTERESTS CANNOT DEMOBILIZE THE
FMLN BECAUSE THE FMLN ENJOYS POPULAR SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

   THE FMLN IS NOT LIKE THE CONTRAS WHO ARE IN HONDURAS AND
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN GO TO THEIR CAMPS TO DEMOBILIZE THEM.
IN EL SALVADOR THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT.  CRISTIANI HIMSELF WAS
UNABLE TO ANSWER A JOURNALIST WHO ASKED HIM IF HE WAS GOING TO
DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN IN SAN SALVADOR, IN GUAZAPA, IN CHALATENANGO, AND
MORAZAN.

   THE COSTA RICA DECLARATION IS NEITHER REALISTIC NOR VIABLE.  THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ALREADY POINTING OUT.
AN INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION NETWORK HAS SAID THAT FOLLOWING THIS
DECLARATION, THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT COULD BECOME JUST WORDS.  A
JOURNALIST HAS ASKED HOW MUCH THIS ALLEGED INTERNATIONAL VICTORY OF
CRISTIANI IS GOING TO LAST.

   MEANWHILE, THE ARCHBISHOP OF GUATEMALA HAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT
EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD FROM THE MEETING BECAUSE NEITHER THE CONTRAS NOR
THE FMLN WERE PRESENT.

   THE REACTION TO THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT ARE ALONG
THESE LINES.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUE FACTS ARE WHAT COUNTS.  WORDS AND PAPER ARE
ALWAYS DEFEATED BY FACTS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ARMY KEEPS BOMBING
AND THAT GENOCIDE WILL ALWAYS BE CONDEMNED.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT YOUR EFFORTS, COMRADES, WILL NOT CEASE UNTIL THE
DICTATORSHIP IS DEFINITELY DEFEATED.

   WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN MARLIN FITZWATER SAID BUSH WILL MEET IN
CARTAGENA, A PORT CITY ABOUT 640 KILOMETERS NORTH OF BOGOTA, WITH
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ
ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA.

WAGED A NATION-WIDE WAR AGAINST DRUG LORDS SINCE LAST AUGUST.

   COLOMBIAN COCAINE LORDS HAVE SET OFF MORE THAN 260 BOMBS, KILLING
AT LEAST 190 PEOPLE, IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN.

   A U.S. ADVANCE TEAM, HEADED BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE BERNARD

UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS AND OBSERVERS WHEN HE
WENT TO VOTE.

   JOURNALIST ELIANA HENRIQUEZ WILL NOW GIVE US MORE DETAILS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HENRIQUEZ] GOOD AFTERNOON.  PRESIDENT AUGUSTO
PINOCHET THIS MORNING LEFT THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE WHERE HE
WENT TO VOTE, ANGRY WITH CHILEANS AND CLEARLY UPSET BY THE PRESENCE OF
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS.  THE HEAD OF STATE WALKED
FROM THE LA MONEDA PALACE TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE, WHICH
IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMUNATEGUI AND MONEDA STREETS.  HE WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTERIOR MINISTER, THE MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL
OF GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL SECRETARY, AND THE CHIEF OF
THE MILITARY HOUSEHOLD.  HE GREETED GENERAL CARLOS PARERA, THE
MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION, AND THE SANTIAGO MAYOR.
PINOCHET THEN WENT TO VOTING TABLE NO 1 WHERE HE WAS SCHEDULED TO
VOTE.  HE SAW DOZENS OF FOREIGN TELEVISION CAMERAMEN, PHOTOGRAPHERS,
AND JOURNALISTS.

   BEFORE ENTERING THE VOTING BOOTH, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS IN VERY GOOD
SPIRITS AND VERY HAPPY.

   AFTER VOTING, PINOCHET SAID HE WAS VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE THIS
MEANT THE END OF THE MISSION HE BEGAN ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973.  HE ADDED
THAT HE EXPECTED THE ELECTION TO DEVELOP AS CALMLY AS USUAL.  WHEN A
U.S. NEWSWOMAN APPROACHED HIM FOR AN INTERVIEW, PINOCHET, IRRITATED,
ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING PUTTING HER NOSE IN HERE; HE TOLD HER
THAT THIS IS OUR PROBLEM, NOT YOURS, INTRUDERS.  PINOCHET THEN TURNED
TO THE LOCAL NEWSMEN AND TOLD THEM THAT HE IS UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS
FOR ALLOWING FOREIGN OBSERVERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.

   [PINOCHET] I AM UNHAPPY WITH CHILEANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR
FEELING OF NATIONALITY BY ACCEPTING THE PRESENCE OF A BUNCH OF
OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE COME TO LOOK OVER WHAT WE ARE DOING.  WHAT DO THEY
THINK THEY ARE DOING?  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE: THESE OUTSIDERS
ARE HERE TO CHECK ON THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED BY
THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THESE GENTLEMEN [A REFERENCE TO OPPOSITION
CANDIDATES IN GENERAL].

   [HENRIQUEZ] AS HE WAS LEAVING THE VOTING SITE, PINOCHET TOLD A
URUGUAYAN CORRESPONDENT THAT THE OBSERVERS ARE INTRUDERS.

   INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES AFFIRMED THAT THE SITUATION AROUND
THE COUNTRY REMAINS NORMAL AND ORDERLY.  HE ADDED THAT THE ONLY
INCIDENT WAS THE BOMB EXPLOSION AT THE EL SALVADORAN EMBASSY AND A
MINOR INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING IN THE LOCALITY OF MARIA
PINTO.  CACERES SAID THAT HE WILL REMAIN ALL DAY AT THE LA MONEDA
PALACE IN ORDER TO BRIEF PRESIDENT PINOCHET ON THE VOTING PROCEEDINGS
AND ANY SECURITY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT ARISE.

   FINALLY, HE SAID THAT THE HEAD OF STATE WILL ALSO STAY IN HIS
OFFICE.  THIS AFTERNOON PINOCHET WILL PROBABLY VISIT THE VOTE COUNTING
CENTER OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ON MONATEGUI STREET.  GOOD AFTERNOON.

NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PARTY TODAY SAID IT REGRETS
THE DECISION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)
TO REJECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN
COSTA RICA.

   ARENA PRESIDENT ARMANDO CALDERON SOL DESCRIBED THE FMLN'S RESPONSE
TO THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS AS "LAST-DITCH EFFORTS."

   CALDERON SAID THAT "THE FMLN CANNOT FIND A WAY TO USE THE POLITICAL
OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT."

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT REJECTED THE COSTA RICAN
AGREEMENTS WITH "INDIGNATION."  IN THE AGREEMENTS, THE PRESIDENTS
REQUEST THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN AND EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   CALDERON SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT "WAS CONDEMNED AND FOR
THAT REASON IT HAS NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO CRITICIZE THE SUMMIT."
CALDERON SOL ADDED THAT "THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS COULD ONLY
EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY."

   CALDERON SAID: "FOREIGN DEMOCRACIES MUST HELP THE SALVADORAN
DEMOCRACY."

   THE SALVADORAN POLITICIAN SAID THAT IT IS "NOT TRUE THAT THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES CIVILIANS' HUMAN RIGHTS," AS THE
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT CLAIMS.

   THE FMLN STATES THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AGREEMENTS
"UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORT THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE
REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND
BOMBED THE CIVILIAN POPULATION."

   CALDERON SOL REPLIED THAT "THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT'S STATEMENTS ARE
ANACHRONISTIC AND INTEND TO DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT."

   SANTIAGO, 15 DEC 89 (TELEVISION NACIONAL DE CHILE NETWORK) --
[COMMUNIQUE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A MAJOR
PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS HELD TODAY.  AFTER 93 PERCENT
OF THE VOTING STATIONS HAVE BEEN COUNTED, AND WHEN ALL THAT IS NEEDED
IS THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE ELECTORAL COURT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY
THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN AZOCAR HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
FOR THE L990-L994 TERM.

   WITH REGARD TO THAT RESULT THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO
CONVEY TO THE PEOPLE THE FOLLOWING:

   1. ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN
EXEMPLARY ELECTION.

   2. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A
DESERVED RECOGNITION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS, WHO HAVE LED
AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN ORDER AND TRANQUILITY, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY AT THE VOTING STATIONS. THEY ENABLED THIS
ELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED
THE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL.  WE MUST, HOWEVER, REPUDIATE THE
VIOLENT MURDER OF A MEMBER OF CARABINEROS.

   3. THE PEOPLE MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
PINOCHET, FAITHFUL TO THE COMMITMENT MADE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND
POLICE, WILL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS RESPECTED.  THE
GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER, AND
TO WAIT WITH TRANQUILITY THE FINAL RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION.

   4. DURING THE LAST 16 YEARS CHILE HAS MOVED AHEAD SYSTEMATICALLY
AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOWARD THE GREAT OBJECTIVES SET FORTH AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FULLY
SATISFIED WITH THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL
RECONSTRUCTION THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL CHILEANS UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET.  WE HAVE SET FORTH A SOLID BASIS FOR
FUTURE PROSPERITY.

   5. THIS ELECTION FULFILLED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
FOR REACHING THE FULL DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE PAST BY THE
ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND PLURALISM.  AS HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT
PINOCHET SAID, 11 SEPTEMBER L973 NOT ONLY REPRESENTED THE OVERTHROW OF
AN ILLEGIMATE AND FAILED GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTED THE END
OF A WORN OUT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REGIME, AND THE NEED TO
BUILD A NEW ONE.  IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT
PRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION.

   6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE
IN SEPTEMBER L973.  THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.  AUTHENTIC
DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED,
AND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990.  FROM NOW ON IT WILL
BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILEAN TO KEEP WATCH SO THAT THE
STABILITY AND PROGRESS ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL AND CONSTANT
EFFORT WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN OUR FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY

   CLANDESTINE, 14 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE
INVESTIGATION, THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE ISSUES
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT REGARDING THE MASSACRE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS:

   THE OPERATION CARRIED OUT TO MURDER THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE
TWO MAIDS LASTED LONGER THAN 1 HOUR.  DURING ALL THAT TIME, THE
PERPETRARORS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS AND DETONATED EXPLOSIVES.  THIS WAS
PROVED BY THE FINDING OF MANY SHELL CASINGS NEAR THE JESUITS'
RESIDENCE.  THE WITNESS' STATEMENTS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE WEAPONS
WERE FIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.  THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
COMMITTED THE CRIME WAS LARGE.  THEY WERE WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS.  THE
WITNESS SAW APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WEARING ARMY UNIFORMS. THE
WITNESS SAW THE MEN.  SHE ALSO HEARD THE SHOOTING, THE CLOSING OF
DOORS, AND THE BREAKING OF GLASS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FACILITIES.
THE WITNESS SAID THAT FIVE INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE SERVANTS' ENTRANCE
OF THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE.  OTHER INDIVIDUALS ENTERED THE RESIDENCE BY
THE DOOR LOCATED IN THE NORTHWESTERN END OF THE BUILDING, WHICH IS THE
AREA WHERE THE PRIESTS HAVE THEIR ROOMS.  ANOTHER GROUP ENTERED THE
JESUIT CENTER, SEARCHED IT, AND BURNED IT WITH SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS
SUCH AS FLAMETHROWERS.

   3.  [NO NUMBERS 1 AND 2 AS HEARD] THE SALVADORAN MILITARY
INTELLIGENCE, THE PERPETRATORS, KNEW THE JESUIT CENTER AND THE JESUIT
RESIDENCE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THEY KNEW THE UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY] FACILITIES.  ON MONDAY, 13 NOVEMBER, INDIVIDUALS WEARING
ARMY UNIFORMS SPECIFICALLY SEARCHED THE JESUIT CENTER AND RESIDENCE.

   4.  THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS LOCATED INSIDE AN ARMY CONTROL AND
SECURITY AREA SINCE THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IS LOCATED
IN THAT SAME GENERAL AREA.  THE ARMY MAINTAINS PERMANENT MILITARY
SURVEILLANCE POSTS AT THE DEMOCRACIA BUILDING, THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE
MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD, THE NORTHERN UCA ENTRANCE, AT THE VARIOUS UCA
SCHOOLS, AND AT LA CEIBA DE GUADALUPE AND JARDINES DE GUADALUPE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALL THOSE AREAS ARE WELL GUARDED BY SOLDIERS.

   5.  DESPITE THE EVIDENT AND VERIFIABLE MILITARIZATION OF THE AREA
WHERE THE CRIME TOOK PLACE, THE CURFEW, THE EXTENDED AND HEAVY FIRING
INSIDE THE UCA PREMISES, THE DETONATION OF EXPLOSIVES FOR AN EXTENDED
PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE PERPETRATORS REMAINED INSIDE THE
JESUIT FACILITIES -- WHICH GAVE THE PERPETRATORS TIME TO SEARCH THE
JESUIT PRIESTS' ROOMS, KILL THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS, AND
SEARCH AND BURN THE JESUIT CENTER CHURCH, THUS PROVING THE SIZE OF THE
OPERATION -- THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT REACT AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS
OPERATION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT].  THIS INDICATES THAT THE SOLDIERS IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY IN THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ARMED
FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF INSTALLATIONS WERE AWARE OF THE OPERATION
THAT WAS BEING CARRIED
 OUT.

   THEREFORE, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE CONCLUDES
THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE TWO MAIDS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 DEC 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PROPOSED TO THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT RESUMING DIPLOMATIC
AND CONSULAR RELATIONS, PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI EXPLAINED ON 13 DECEMBER
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

   "I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT UNILATERALLY NORMALIZING RELATIONS, NOR
ARE WE THINKING OF DOING THIS UNLESS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT
COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PRESENTED IN A DOCUMENT IN
SAN JOSE," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE HOSTED ON 12 DECEMBER, HE SAID THAT THE
PRESIDENTS OF GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND COSTA RICA HAD URGED SOME TYPE
OF DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH ORTEGA TO SEEK NORMALIZING RELATIONS
WITH NICARAGUA, AND AS A RESULT HE PRESENTED THE DOCUMENTS WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS.

   UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OF 13 DECEMBER, THE NICARAGUAN REGIME HAD NOT
ANSWERED THE MINIMUM CONDITIONS FOR EL SALVADOR TO REESTABLISH OR
NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MANAGUA.

   EL SALVADOR SUSPENDED ALL TYPES OF RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA ON 26
NOVEMBER, AFTER THE SALVADORAN ARMY DISCOVERED A PLANE COMING FROM
MANAGUA WITH WEAPONS FOR THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN].

   CRISTIANI HAS INSISTED THAT "WITHOUT THE MATERIAL SUPPORT THAT THE
SANDINIST GOVERNMENT GIVES THE TERRORISTS OPERATING HERE, THEY WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH THE UNSUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE OF 11 NOVEMBER
IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, HE SHOWED ORTEGA A
GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE OF THE NICARAGUAN INTERVENTION IN SALVADORAN
AFFAIRS.

   HE ALSO SHOWED ALL THE PRESIDENTS A VIDEO IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE
FMLN ARE SHOWN RECEIVING TRAINING IN NICARAGUA, AND IN WHICH FMLN
LEADERS SUCH AS JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL AND OTHERS ARE SHOWN RECEIVING
INSTRUCTIONS IN MANAGUA, AND OTHER EVIDENCE.  AFTER VIEWING SEVERAL
MINUTES OF SUCH EVIDENCE, ORTEGA GOT UP AND TOLD THE PRESIDENTS HE WAS
GOING TO MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL, BUT HE NEVER RETURNED TO THE ROOM,
CRISTIANI SAID.  "IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WAS NEVER ABLE TO DENY HE IS
SENDING WEAPONS AND HELP TO THE FMLN," THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 15 DEC 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS CALLED ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT THE
PEACE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  AT A MEETING
WITH RESIDENTS OF NIQUINOMO, ORTEGA TALKED ABOUT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REGION DURING THE MEETING IN SAN ISIDRO DE CORONADO,
COSTA RICA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ORTEGA] THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA RICA ARE
ANOTHER STEP FOWARD IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED, BECAUSE, AS I WAS TELLING
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS YESTERDAY, IT IS ONE THING TO AGREE ON
SOMETHING AND SIGN AN AGREEMENT, BUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE RETURN TO OUR
COUNTRIES IS QUITE ANOTHER.  THERE MUST BE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT IS
SIGNED AND WHAT IS DONE.  IF WE SIGN AN AGREEMENT AND PROMISE TO
RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, THEN WE MUST RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS - - NOT KILL
PRIESTS AND BRUTALLY REPRESS THE PEOPLE AS IN EL SALVADOR.  IF WE
AGREE THAT THE CONTRAS MUST BE DEMOBILIZED, THEN THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT MUST DO ITS PART TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTRAS ARE
DEMOBILIZED.  WE MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE
AGREEMENTS.  THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT AFTER EVERY PRESIDENTIAL
SUMMIT IS HELD AND AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED, THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT RESPECT THEM AND CONTINUES TO DO AS IT PLEASES.  I HOPE THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE UNITED STATES CAN SHOW ITS
WILLINGNESS TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS BY REFRAINING FROM HINDERING
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TRULY
WILLING TO RESPECT THESE AGREEMENTS, THEN IT MUST NO LONGER GIVE THE
CONTRAS MONEY TO MURDER THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. LIKE THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID, THAT MONEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION.  ONLY IN THIS
WAY WILL THE CONTRAS STOP BEING A THREAT TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 15 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M-19] HAS ASKED VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ FOR
POLITICAL SUPPORT TO SECURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN
THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO.

   EVERTH BUSTAMANTE, THE M-19'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SECRETARY,
SAID TODAY IN CARACAS THAT ON 14 DECEMBER HE INFORMED PEREZ ABOUT THE
GRAVE POLITICAL CRISIS WHICH HAD EXPLODED IN HIS COUNTRY IN RECENT
DAYS.

   THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA'S TWO LARGEST
POLITICAL PARTIES, AS WELL AS THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS' POSITION IN
FAVOR OF SUBMITTING TO A REFERENDUM THE RULING ON EXTRADITING DRUG
TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS, IN DEFIANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, HAS
CREATED A POLITICAL VACUUM IN THE COUNTRY AND, BUSTAMANTE SAID, THE
GOVERNMENT NO LONGER HAS A MONOPOLY OF POWER.  THIS SITUATION, HE
ADDED, CREATES DOUBTS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN
NOVEMBER 1988 [AS RECEIVED] BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT.  IN LINE
WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE REBELS WOULD SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT MONTHS THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS MET ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE
M-19 AND HAS PROPOSED THAT THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL RECEIVE THE
ARMS OF THIS GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION WHICH WANTS TO JOIN COLOMBIA'S
POLITICAL LIFE.

   BUSTAMANTE SAID THAT THE SITUATION THAT HAS EMERGED HAS IMPOSED A
DELAY IN THE SURRENDERING THE WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 19
DECEMBER.  HE DID NOT GIVE A NEW DATE FOR THIS ACTION, BUT HE DID NOT
DISCARD EITHER THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE IN JANUARY OF NEXT
YEAR.

   AN ACUTE POLITICAL CONFRONTATION EXPLODED IN COLOMBIA WHEN THE
COLOMBIA CONGRESS DECIDED, AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'S WILL, TO SUBMIT TO
A REFERENDUM THE PRACTICE OF EXTRADITING DRUG TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS TO
THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THEY MAY BE TRIED THERE.

   BUSTAMANTE NOTED: THIS MAKES IT EVIDENT THAT MANY LEGISLATORS
SUPPORT THE DEMANDS OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  BUSTAMANTE ADMITTED,
HOWEVER, THAT THESE EXTRADITIONS VIOLATE COLOMBIA'S CONSTITUTION.

   ACCORDING TO THE M-19 LEADER, "THE ONLY WAY" OF OVERCOMING THE
CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS IS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED TO
TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR AND TO CONVOKE A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
AND A REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THESE TWO POINTS FORM PART OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN NOVEMBER 1988
[AS RECEIVED] BY THE M-19 AND THE GOVERNMENT.

   BUSTAMANTE, WHO LEAVES TOMORROW FOR MEXICO CITY AND LONDON, CALLED
ON THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS TO SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS IF THE
GOVERNMENT CONVOKES A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

HERNANADEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHBISHOPRIC LEGAL ASSITANCE OFFICE, MADE
OFFICIAL STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE UCA
[CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] PRIESTS.

   IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST ISSUED BY THE SALVADORAN 4TH CRIMINAL
COURT, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ MADE STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT
REGARDING THE MURDER OF SIX UCA JESUIT PRIESTS.  THE PRIESTS WERE
KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO HERNANDEZ, HER STATEMENT WAS PERSONAL AND SHE LIMITED
HERSELF TO REPORTING ON THE INVESTIGATIONS SHE CONDUCTED AT UCA AFTER
THE MURDER.  IN HER STATEMENT, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT SHE FOUND FOUR
BULLET CASINGS INSIDE UCA.  THE PROSECUTORS THEN ALLEGED THAT SHE HAD
COMMITTED A CRIME BY PICKING UP EVIDENCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I MADE PERSONAL STATEMENTS AS A
WITNESS. I TOLD THEM WHAT I SAW AND HEARD AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.
THAT IS WHAT I DID.  THE PROSECUTORS ASKED ME ABOUT THE EVIDENCE I HAD
GATHERED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME.  I PICKED UP FOUR BULLET CASINGS.
THE PROSECUTORS SAID I HAD COMMITTED A CRIME.  THAT IS, THEREFORE, THE
CRIME I COMMITTED.  [END RECORDING]

   ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS TO FORMULATE AN
OPINION, HERNANDEZ SAID THAT AS AN INSTITUTION, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE, WHICH SHE DID NOT
MENTION, INDICATES THAT ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, WHO REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED,
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] THE CHURCH ALREADY ISSUED ITS
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT CLEARLY STATING THAT THERE ARE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   [REPORTER] ON WHAT DOES THE CHURCH BASE THAT ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ON THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPRIC
LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE.

   [REPORTER] YES, BUT WHAT PROOF DOES THE CHURCH HAVE TO MAKE THAT
ASSERTION?

   [HERNANDEZ] ALL THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE CHURCH DOCUMENT THAT WAS
ALREADY RELEASED.  YOU CAN GET THAT DOCUMENT IF YOU WANT.  [END
RECORDING]

   IN ADDITION, MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ DENIED STATEMENTS MADE BY SOME
MILITARY CHIEFS WHO SAID THAT WITNESS LUCIA CERNA, WHO IS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, WAS NEVER MANIPULATED OR PRESSURED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [HERNANDEZ] I WAS INTRODUCED TO MRS CERNA BY THE
HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL JESUIT ORDER ON MONDAY, 20 NOVEMBER.  IN FRONT
OF HIM, MRS CERNA MADE HER STATEMENT.  AND SHE MADE THAT SAME
STATEMENT BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTORS AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY.
THEY ARE WITNESSES TO THOSE STATEMENTS.

   IN OTHER WORDS, SHE MADE THE STATEMENT AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY
BEFORE I MET HER.  I COULD NOT HAVE MANIPULATED HER AT ALL.  [END
RECORDING]

   THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT PROCEDURES REGARDING THIS CASE WILL CONTINUE
IN ORDER TO TRY TO CLARIFY THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDING
IGNACIO ELLACURIA.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER FIDEL CHAVEZ
MENA AND SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ STILL
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS BEFORE THE COURT.

   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN SENATE TODAY
APPROVED A PARDON LAW THAT AUTHORIZES COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO TO "PARDON" OVER THE NEXT 6 MONTHS THE ARMED GROUPS THAT HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE.

   THE MEASURE INITIALLY FAVORS THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT [M-19], WHICH
PROMISED THE GOVERNMENT TO SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS AND GIVE UP VIOLENCE
IN ORDER TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY.

   THE PARDON LAW IS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT IN
THE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH THE M-19 AS A RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS
THAT BEGAN LAST MARCH AND THAT SHOULD CONCLUDE WITH THE TOTAL
DEMOBILIZATION OF THE M-19 AND THE DELIVERY OF ITS WEAPONS TO THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL.

   ONCE ITS MAIN LEADERS, AGAINST WHOM THERE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES FOR
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE STATE, ARE PARDONED, THE M-19 WILL BECOME A
LEGAL, POLITICAL GROUP.

   THE M-19 WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER ITS WEAPONS ON 19 DECEMBER, BUT
THE ACTION WAS SUSPENDED UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE REGARDING THE AGREED
UPON CREATION OF A "SPECIAL ELECTORAL DISTRICT, WHICH WOULD "GUARANTEE
THE M-19" AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.

   THAT MEASURE, WHICH IS PART OF THE "PACKAGE" OF CONSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WAS SUSPENDED AT THE CONGRESS,
WHICH COULD NOT REACH AN AGREEMENT ON IT BEFORE THE END OF ITS REGULAR
SESSION.

   THE REFORMS ALSO INCLUDED THE HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM TO CONSULT
THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ON THE EXTRADITION ISSUE.  LEGAL EXTRADITION WAS
ADOPTED THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE IN ORDER TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THE COLOMBIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' APPROVAL OF
THE INCLUSION OF THE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM CAUSED A
POLITICAL CRISIS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE LIBERAL
AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES.

   TODAY THE PLENUM OF THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS DID NOT APPROVE THE
HOLDING OF A PLEBISCITE IN SEPTEMBER 1990, IN WHICH THE VOTERS WOULD
DECIDE TO EITHER APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, BECAUSE OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF FORMER PRESIDENTS JULIO
CESAR TURBAY AYALA AND MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, LEADERS OF THE LIBERAL
AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES, RESPECTIVELY.

   TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE DECISION MADE IN CONGRESS, WHICH ALONG
WITH THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL CLOSE ITS REGULAR SESSION
PERIOD ON 17 DECEMBER, GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, A.K.A THE MEXICAN, ONE
OF THE MOST WANTED COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THE NUMBER-TWO MAN
IN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS KILLED DURING A CLASH WITH THE POLICE.

GROUP [GOES] ...HOW MANY UNITS PARTICIPATED IN THIS ACTION?

   [CASADIEGO] IT WAS A STRIKE THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIZED
GROUP, BUT THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE
NATIONAL POLICE IN GENERAL.  THIS WORK WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ALL THOSE WHO
ARE IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   [REPORTER] HOW WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT INFORMED ABOUT
THIS?

   [CASADIEGO] JUST AS I AM REPORTING IT TO YOU.  I TOLD THE PRESIDENT
THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS AFTER
THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT TELL YOU AFTER YOU GAVE HIM THE
NEWS?

   [CASADIEGO] IT WAS SIMPLY A NATIONAL POLICE REPORT TO THE
PRESIDENT.  LATER ON, WE WILL PROVIDE HIM WITH THE DETAILS AFTER THE
INSPECTORS RETURN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND IN THE AREA WHERE THE OPERATION
WAS CARRIED OUT?  DID YOU FIND WEAPONS?  WERE SOME PEOPLE ABLE TO
ESCAPE?

   [CASADIEGO] NO, I HAVE NO MORE DETAILS.  WE ARE JUST RECEIVING THE
INFORMATION OVER THE RADIO, AND WE CANNOT GIVE DETAILS OVER THE RADIO.

   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES REGARDING
THIS INFORMATION?

   [CASADIEGO] WITHOUT DOUBT, THIS INFORMATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED WITH
FULLER DETAILS BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THE GENERALS
AND THE NATIONAL POLICE STAFF ARE MEETING HERE.  WE ARE GOING TO
CONDUCT A SERIES OF OPERATIONS TO CONSOLIDATE THE AREA AND TO DO WHAT
THE LAW REQUIRES.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJOR DRUG CARTEL LEADERS?

   [CASADIEGO] WE ARE DOING OUR JOB AND THIS IS PROOF THAT WE ARE
DOING OUR JOB.  I BELIEVE THAT COLOMBIA MUST CONGRATULATE THE NATIONAL
POLICE FOR THE JOB THEY HAVE DONE.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, YOU HAVE SAID THE AREA IS BEING REINFORCED.
DOES THIS MEAN MORE NATIONAL POLICE TROOPS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE
AREA?  WILL THE OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN SEARCH OF OTHER DRUG CARTEL
LEADERS?

   [CASADIEGO] WE ARE SEARCHING AND BLOCKING OFF THE AREA. THAT IS
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

   [REPORTER] IS THAT THE REPORT THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE RELEASED TO
THE GOVERNMENT AND TO COLOMBIANS?

   [CASADIEGO] THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RELEASED TO THEM, AND WE ASK
ALL CITIZENS TO CONTINUE COOPERATING WITH US.  THEY CAN BE SURE THAT
WE WILL TRY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THE NUMBER OF CRIMES BEING COMMITTED.

THE CONTRAS.

   BORGE MADE THIS STATEMENT TO NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS AFTER A MEETING
WITH PRESIDENT MENEM AT THE OLIVOS PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE.

   BORGE IS VISITING BUENOS AIRES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING OF THE
COORDINATING BOARD OF LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES (COPPAL).
PRESIDENT MENEM WILL CLOSE THIS MEETING NEXT MONDAY.

   BORGE SAID THAT THE ARGENTINE PRESIDENT "FAVORS A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION" TO THE NICARAGUAN CONFLICT, AND HE ADDED THAT FOREIGN
MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SHARES THE SAME IDEA.

   REGARDING TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND NICARAGUA, THE
SANDINIST LEADER ONLY SAID THAT THEY ARE "IN A PROCESS OF BEING
DISCUSSED."

   HE ADDED THAT THE SANDINIST MOVEMENT PARTICIPATED IN THE COSTA
RICAN MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS BECAUSE IT FEELS THAT
"PEACE IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE REGION AND ESPECIALLY FOR
NICARAGUA."

   BORGE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
RAISES PEACE "AS A BANNER" IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN CURRENTLY UNDER
WAY IN THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   BORGE SAID: "THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF
THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING IN COSTA RICA, AS IT WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE
RESULTS OF THE ESQUIPULAS AND TELA MEETINGS."

   HE ADDED: "THE UNITED STATES IS INTERESTED IN KEEPING THE
COUNTERREVOLUTION ALIVE TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE NICARAGUAN ELECTORAL
PROCESS."

   HE CONTINUED: "ALTHOUGH THE CONTRAS' HAVE BEEN STRATEGICALLY
DEFEATED, THEY STILL CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR INCURSIONS AND
TERRORIST ATTACKS."

   BORGE EXPLAINED THAT THE COSTA RICAN AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE
"COMPULSORY DEMOBILIZATION" OF THE CONTRAS, WHILE CONCERNING THE
FARABUNDO MARTI LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR, THE "DEMOBILIZATION
IS VOLUNTARY."

   HE SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPORTING THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT
"HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED IN THAT COUNTRY AND TO NEUTRALIZE THE
BARBARITY COMMITTED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY."

   BORGE ADDED THAT IN COSTA RICA THE PRESIDENTS REITERATED THE
AGREEMENTS MADE IN ESQUIPULAS AND TELA AND THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN URGED TO CONDUCT "A TRUE NEGOTIATION WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI
FRONT.  [NO END QUOTE AS RECEIVED]

   BORGE ADDED THAT IN NICARAGUA THERE IS "PARTICIPATIVE DEMOCRACY,"
AND THAT "THIS DEMOCRACY WILL BE CONFIRMED IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS."

   "WE DO NOT WANT A DEMOCRACY SUBORDINATED TO THE U.S. IMPERIALISM,"
HE SAID, ADDING THAT "NICARAGUAN PARTICIPATIVE DEMOCRACY HAS ALSO
ADOPTED MANY ELEMENTS OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED TRADITIONAL DEMOCRACY."

   HE SAID THAT THE DEMOLITION OF THE BERLIN WALL "IS GOOD," BUT HE
ADDED: "IN THE WORLD TODAY THERE ARE MANY WALLS TO BE TORN DOWN,
INCLUDING THE WALL THAT DIVIDES THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE WALL
BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES."

   BOGOTA, 16 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [REPORT]
[PATRICIA JARAMILLO] [TEXT] AN ELITE NATIONAL POLICE FORCE, SPECIALLY
TRAINED FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMANDO ACTION, CARRIED OUT THE OPERATION IN
WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA WAS KILLED.  THE SPECIAL ARMED CORPS
[CUERPO ESPECIAL ARMADO], CEA, WAS ESTABLISHED BY DECREE NO 814 OF 19
APRIL 1989.  THIS CORPS IS MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE ELITE FORCE.

   THE GROUP WAS INITIALLY FORMED BY 250 QUALIFIED POLICEMEN AND WAS
GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DEATH SQUADS, BANDS OF
PAID ASSASSINS, AND SELF-DEFENSE OR PRIVATE VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT ARE
SOMETIMES CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE ANTI-TERRORIST FORCE
MEMBERS WERE TRAINED AT THE POLICE NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS ACADEMY
LOCATED IN A MOUNTAINOUS REGION IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA FOR 3
MONTHS. LATER ON, THESE MEN WERE SENT TO DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN THE
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN ANTIOQUIA.

   THE ELITE FORCES STARTED TO WORK ON 2 MAY, AND RESULTS APPEARED VERY SOON
AFTER THAT.  THE CEA UNDERTOOK AN OPERATION NAMED RAINBOW [ARCOIRIS] AND
DISMANTLED 10 COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORIES IN THE MID-MAGADALENA REGION
IN LESS THAN 8 DAYS.  GENERAL BENJAMIN FRANKLIN LOST HIS LIFE DURING THIS
OPERATION.  LATER ON THEY ALSO DISMANTLED AN ASSASSIN TRAINING SCHOOL AT
META, DESTROYED CLANDESTINE AIRPORTS, AND ABORTED A TERRORIST PLAN IN
CARTAGENA THAT INCLUDED DYNAMITING ITS NAVAL BASE, MAIN INDUSTRIES, AND CAIS
[IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTERS].  AFTER LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED, THE
ELITE FORCES HELD TWO BIG OPERATIONS IN YACOPI, THE RIO NEGRO REGION WHERE
RODRIGUEZ GACHA ESTABLISHED SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE OPERATIVES HAD THE
OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING RODRIGUEZ GACHA BUT HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE SPECIAL
FORCES ALSO CONDUCTED AN OPERATION AT COCORNAC IN AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE
PABLO ESCOBAR BUT HE ALSO MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THE BLOW DELIVERED BY THE
ELITE FORCES YESTERDAY, IN WHICH THE MEXICANO [GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA]
FELL, WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HARD INTELLIGENCE, INVESTIGATION, AND ESPIONAGE
WORK.  HERE IS WHAT POLICE DIRECTOR MAJOR GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ HAS TO SAY:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GOMEZ] WE ARE VERY SATISFIED TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
OUR MISSION.  OUR INSTITUTION HAS RESPONDED TO THE DEMANDS OF THE
COUNTRY.  WE ARE HELPING COLOMBIA RID ITSELF OF ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE
GENERATED BY THESE CRIMINALS.  [END RECORDING]

   THE ELITE FORCES WILL CONTINUE ITS WORK WITH 1,000 MEN, 17
HELICOPTERS, THE ADVISE OF BRITISH AND ITALIAN EXPERTS, AND THE UNITED
STATES' ECONOMIC AND LOGISTICAL AID.

   BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 (EL SIGLO) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCC]
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE RECENT ATTACK
AGAINST THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY]
AND EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH DAS GENERAL DIRECTOR GENERAL ALFREDO MAZA
MARQUEZ.

   THE PCC LEADERSHIP NOTES THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IT HAS ENDORSED
GEN MAZA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE "CANDID, COURAGEOUS, AND SHED LIGHT
ON THE NEFARIOUS ROLE CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY AND POLICE LEADERSHIP
HAVE PLAYED IN HELPING ORGANIZE BANDS OF HIRED KILLERS AND THEIR
UNPATRIOTIC EFFORTS AS GO-BETWEENS IN HIRING MERCENARIES WHO TRAIN THE
FASCIST BANDS AND MURDER COLOMBIANS."

   THE PCC CENTRAL COMMITTEE ADDS THAT:

   "THE MEASURES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY
PRESIDENT BARCO'S ADMINISTRATION WILL BE INEFFECTIVE UNLESS THE ARMY'
UPPER ECHELON IS REORGANIZED IMMEDIATELY AND PURGED OF ITS CORRUPT
ELEMENTS.  ONLY IN THIS WAY WILL THE "ELITE FORCE" BE PREVENTED FROM
CONTINUING TO CARRY OUT GANGSTER-STYLE ASSAULTS AND BE MADE TO GEAR
ITS ACTIONS TOWARD THE GROUPS WHICH ARE REALLY DESTABILIZING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES THROUGH CRIME AND BRIBERY; THAT IS, THE
PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION,
META, CAQUETA, CORDOBA, THE URABA AREA IN ANTIOQUIA, AND IN OTHER
PLACES, AS GEN MAZA HAS REPORTED WITH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE."

   CLANDESTINE, 18 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] THIS IS A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN TO
ALL SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO OUR HEROIC LEADERS AND FIGHTERS:

   ON 11 NOVEMBER, ALL OF OUR FORCES BEGAN THE MAJOR NATIONAL
OFFENSIVE THAT GAVE A STRATEGIC TURN TO THE WAR.  OUR FIGHTERS HAVE
CARRIED OUT COUNTLESS HEROIC AND DARING ACTS SINCE THEM.  NEITHER THE
CONCENTRATION OF THE ELITE BATTALIONS IN SAN SALVADOR NOR THE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE OR FULL RANGE OF U.S.
TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERIENCE COULD PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING AND
OCCUPYING EXTENSIVE URBAN AREAS AND ORGANIZING STRATEGIC HARASSMENT OF
THE CITY.

   OUR HEROIC FIGHTERS ASSAULTED THE COUNTRY'S FIVE MAJOR VITAL
CENTERS -- SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, USULUTAN, AND
ZACATECOLUCA.  BEGINNING ON THE 11TH, THE WAR THEATRE IRREVERSIBLY
MOVED FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE MAIN CITIES.  TO POSTPONE IMMINENT
COLLAPSE AND TO STOP A PEOPLE'S UPRISING, THE FATALLY WOUNDED MILITARY
LEADERSHIP AND THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT ORDERED THAT THE LOW-INCOME
NEIGHBORHOODS BE BOMBARDED.  THEY DID NOT CARE HOW MANY CIVILIAN LIVES
IT WOULD COST.  WITH ALL OF ITS ELITE AND REGULAR BATTALIONS, THE
ENEMY ARMY WAS REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE AND TO GUARDING THE CITIES.
EXTENSIVE AREAS AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ARE LIBERATED
TERRITORY.

   THE WAR IS NOW WHERE IT CAN BE DEFINED -- IN THE VITAL CENTERS.  THERE IS
NO WAY THE OLIGARCHS' EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC PROGRAM CAN TAKE OFF AND THE
FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], WITH ITS
GENOCIDAL BRUTALITY UNMASKED, IS INTERNATIONALLY ISOLATED AND HATED BY THE
PEOPLE FOR ITS CRIMES.

   THIS GREAT EFFORT OF AUDACITY AND HEROISM THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
HAS PLACED THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IN
THEIR MOST CRITICAL POSITION OF THE 9 YEARS OF WAR.  THUS FAR, DURING
THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT -- WHICH HAS GIVEN TO EL SALVADOR AND THE
WORLD REAL HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE FOR OUR COUNTRY -- 401 OF THE
MOST GENEROUS AND BRAVE SONS OF OUR HOMELAND HAVE FALLEN IN COMBAT.
THIS LIST IS HEADED BY OUR DEAR AND UNFORGETTABLE COMRADE COMMANDER
DIMAS RODRIGUEZ, TO WHOM WE OWE DECISIVE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONDUCT
OF OUR STRUGGLE TOWARD VICTORY.

   THE FOLLOWING MILITARY COMMANDERS WHO FELL IN COMBAT ALSO MADE A
CONTRIBUTION: JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL CERVELLON, COMMANDER OSCAR;
JEHOVA VASQUEZ, COMMANDER CIRILO; OVIDIO LOPEZ, COMMANDER ORLANDO
MORALES; COMMANDER MISAEL GALLARDO; COMMANDER NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA,
WILBERT; COMMANDER RICARDO MIRANDA, ESTEBAN RUIZ; AND THE COMMANDER
ODIR POLITICAL DIRECTORS [RESPONSABLES] -- JOSE SANTOS YANEZ, PEPE;
AND MILAGRO ALVARADO, JUDY.

   WE RELEASE THE NAMES OF THESE HEROES IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO
REGISTER THEM ETERNALLY IN THE HIGHEST PLACE IN OUR HISTORY.  THEIR
DEVOTION MULTIPLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE PEOPLE'S POWER.  HUNDREDS OF
NEW FIGHTERS ALREADY HAVE THE WEAPONS AND ENTHUSIASM OF THOSE WHO HAVE
FALLEN.  THEY ARE AT THE FRONTLINE OF THIS POWER OF THE FUTURE WHICH
IS BUILDING, BEFORE THE WORLD'S ADMIRING EYES, DEMOCRATIC AND JUST EL
SALVADOR.

   ALONGSIDE OUR HEROES, THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS HAVE
FERTILIZED THE PATH TO PEACE WITH THEIR BLOOD, VICTIMS OF THE FATALLY
WOUNDED BEAST -- THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION) UNION MEMBERS, THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ANONYMOUS
PEOPLE MASSACRED IN THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS.

   THE REALIZATION OF A GENUINE AND DEFINITIVE CHANGE IS ENSURED BY
THE GREAT POWER OF OUR REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, OF ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, AND
OF WORLD SOLIDARITY.  THOSE WHO FELL TAUGHT TO US THE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO FINISH THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT, TO CONQUER WHAT WE
THINK THE PEOPLE JUSTLY DESERVE -- DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND PEACE.

   ETERNAL GLORY TO THE HEROES AND MARTYRS, BUILDERS OF DEMOCRACY AND
PEACE.  THE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES, VICTORY IS NEAR.

   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND; COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN,
JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, EDUARDO SANCHO, FRANCISCO JOVEL, AND SHAFIK JORGE
HANDAL.

DEV-MUC3-1010 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEO
CABRAL, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COMMANDER, BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK
COMRADE LEO CABRAL IS: WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE OFFENSIVE AFTER 1
MONTH?

   [CABRAL] TODAY, 11 DECEMBER, AFTER 1 MONTH OF A GLORIOUS AND
VICTORIOUS OFFENSIVE, WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS REGARDING THIS LATEST
FIGHT.  WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN
IS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL.  THERE
HAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS
FORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH
COMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES.

   YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO
DISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11
NOVEMBER.  WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED,
THEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND
ANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE.  FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL
FORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR
ANNIHILATION.  THIS ALSO FAILED.  FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF
THEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI
AND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF
OPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY
AND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT.  AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO
VERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH
INTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO
FAILED.  THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS
INTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO
CUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS
THEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN.  THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL
THE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES.  WE
ALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT
CONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS
CAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.  THIS MEANS THAT
EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE
PUPPET TROOPS.  WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON
ORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO
LOCAL REACTIONARY POWER.

   WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH
THE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
SMASHED.  THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED
MANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE
REPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA
BANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE.  WE MUST
ALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING
THIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT
ANOTHER PLAN.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE
MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS
AND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT
PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE
INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT
THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF
THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.  SO THIS IS ANOTHER SUCCESS.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1011 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 DEC 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] MANY POLITICAL,
UNION, UNIVERSITY, RELIGIOUS, AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
"BEHEADED" BY THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS A
MONTH AGO, BY THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO THE OFFENSIVE, AND BY EXTREMIST
GROUPS' RETALIATORY ACTIONS.

   THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- MOST OF WHICH ACTIVELY FAVORED A POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN WAR -- HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT MAIN LEADERS
BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO PARTY MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS, THEY HAVE BEEN
KILLED, FORCED TO HIDE OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR "SECURITY REASONS"

   THE JESUIT CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY'S (UCA) MAIN LEADERS WERE
MURDERED.  ACCORDING TO RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY
50 PRIESTS -- SALVADORAN AND FOREIGNERS -- HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY
BECAUSE THEY FELT "PERSECUTED" BY THE ARMY WHICH LINKS THEM TO THE
GUERRILLAS.

   THE EDITORIAL OF THE 15 DECEMBER EDITION OF "PROCESO" -- A UCA
WEEKLY PUBLICATION -- ASSERTS THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS ON
UCA PREMISES ON 16 NOVEMBER, OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME WHEN SEVERAL
CHURCHES AND UNION HEADQUARTERS WERE BEING SEARCHED BY "PEOPLE IN
UNIFORMS."

   "PROCESO" MANTAINS THAT "APPARENTLY, THEY WANTED TO STRIKE ONE SINGLE
BLOW AND BEHEAD EVERY ORGANIZATION LABELED BY GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA AS AN
FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FACADE."

   HOWEVER, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID BEFORE HE LEFT
TO ATTEND A CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA, THAT
HIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PERSECUTE RELIGIOUS LEADERS.

   THREE DAYS AFTER THE GUERRILLAS STARTED THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE IN
THE DECADE -- ON 14 NOVEMBER -- GUILLERMO UNGO AND HECTOR OQUELI, THE
MAIN LEFTIST OPPOSITION LEADERS, LEFT EL SALVADOR, SAYING THAT THEY
HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN MESSAGES BROADCAST OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S
RADIO NETWORK.

   LEADERS OF THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS (CGT) -- WHICH IS
LINKED TO THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY
ARE BEING PERSECUTED AND BLAME THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS FOR
"VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS."

   CGT LEADER JOSE LUIS GRANDE PREZA ASSERTED THAT "TO RECUPERATE AND
MANTAIN THEIR PRIVILEGES, THE EXTREME RIGHTISTS HAVE UNSCRUPULOUSLY
TURNED THE ARMY AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE AND GENERATED REPRESSION AND
PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH, THE OPPOSITION, AND UNION MOVEMENTS."

   BEFORE LEAVING FOR GUATEMALA TO OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN
EL SALVADOR, GRANDE PREZA SAID THE GUERRILLAS "VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS IN
THE NAME OF REVOLUTION" AND THAT "EACH SIDE JUSTIFIES ITS VIOLENCE,
BUT THE ONLY TRUTH IS THAT THE PEOPLE ALWAYS END UP BURYING THE DEAD."

   LUDOVICO SAMAYOA, DEPUTY OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], ASSERTED THAT TWO PDC MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS IN
ILOBASCO HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ARMY MEMBERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.
ILOBASCO IS LOCATED 60 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   "THE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A GENERALIZED REPRESSION TO DISMANTLE
THE PARTY AND FRIGHTEN OUR MEMBERS WITH THESE ARRESTS," SAID SAMAYOA.

   HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COORDINATOR MIGUEL MONTENEGRO SAID THAT HIS
OFFICE, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE THE
GOVERNMENT, "WERE SEARCHED AND DESTROYED BY BOMBS" IN THE EASTERN CITY
OF SAN MIGUEL.

   IGNACIO ELLACURIA, ONE OF THE SIX JESUITS MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
FOUNDER OF "PROCESO" AND UCA DIRECTOR, HAD NOTED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE
HIS DEATH THAT "THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD ENTERED A NEW
PHASE OF MODERATION AND FLEXIBILITY WITH THE INCREASE OF POLITICAL
SPACES."

   IN CONTRAST THE EDITORIAL THAT APPEARS IN THE NEXT EDITION OF
"PROCESO" STRESSES: "IT IS THE HOUR OF THE LONG KNIVES.  THE MALESTROM
OF BLOOD THAT HAS COME UPON THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST MONTH HAS SHRED TO
PIECES THE PHASE OF MODERATION IN WHICH THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS OF THE
SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS HAD BEEN INVOLVED."

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 DEC 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT
WAS SPECULATED THAT CHANGES OF COMMAND IN CERTAIN ARMED FORCES KEY POSTS
WOULD TAKE PLACE LATE IN 1989.

   COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, DISREGARDED THIS
POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY,
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY
STABLE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I THINK THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
DEMANDS MILITARY STABILITY.  CHANGES COULD PROVOKE SOME UNREST.  WE
THINK NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MILITARY COMMAND SHOULD BE MADE AT
PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SHOULD ANY CHANGES BE MADE,
IT WOULD BE FOR MAJOR REASONS IN THE SERVICE. NO HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES
HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED, HOWEVER. [END RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE REBELS' ACTIVITIES, COL PONCE SAID THE ARMED
ACTIONS INITIATED, PARTICULARLY IN SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAVE
ENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  HE ADVISED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL CONTINUE TO SABOTAGE THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY AND PERPETRATE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED,
MILITARILY SPEAKING.  THE FMLN'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS
ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND
TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS
AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED,
HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN AT PRESENT CAN BE
DISREGARDED. [END RECORDING]

   REGARDING THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FESTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN
MARRED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHETHER THE
2300 - TO - 0500 CURFEW IS STILL IN FORCE.  PONCE SAID THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIFTING THE CURFEW AT LEAST ON 24 AND 31 DECEMBER IS BEING
CONSIDERED SO THAT THE SALVADORAN FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THESE
FESTIVITIES.  HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON
THE FMLN'S STANCE.  FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN
MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND
MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING
COFFEE.

   BOGOTA, 20 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MEDICAL SPOKESMEN OF THE SANTO
TOMAS HOSPITAL HAVE ACCUSED THE U.S. INVADING TROOPS OF PREVENTING
AMBULANCES FROM TRANSITING AND PROVIDING MEDICAL ATTENTION TO THE MANY
WOUNDED IN STRATEGIC SECTORS OF THE PANAMANIAN CAPITAL.

   JORGE DIAZ, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL, TOLD THE COLOMBIAN
RADIO STATION CARACOL THAT THE FOREIGN SOLDIERS ARE FIRING MACHINEGUNS
AT AMBULANCES THAT ARE PASSING THOUGH THE CITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, THE HOSPITAL, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN
PANAMA, HAS RECEIVED ABOUT 50 DEAD, WHILE OVER 100 ARE RECOVERING FROM
SERIOUS WOUNDS.

   HE SAID THAT ONLY SIX OR SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE FORCES HAVE
BEEN TAKEN THERE; THUS MOST OF THE VICTIMS ARE INHABITANTS OF
LOW-INCOME AREAS SHELLED BY U.S. AIRPLANES.

   "FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WE HEARD THE BOMB EXPLOSIONS.  MANY
HOMES ARE ON FIRE, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK," DIAZ
SAID.

   SIMILARLY, ALFONSO ZAMORA, DPA CORRESPONDENT IN PANAMA CITY, SAID
DRAMATICALLY TO THE COLOMBIAN STATION: "WE ARE ON THE FLOOR." HE SAID
THE EXCHANGE OF FIRE HAS INTENSIFIED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL.

   QUITO, 20 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] ECUADOR TODAY CONDEMNED THE U.S.
MILITARY FORCES' ACTION IN PANAMA, WHICH IT DESCRIBED AS A "FLAGRANT
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES," BUT SAID THAT IT WAS GENERAL
MANUEL NORIEGA'S "UNDEMOCRATIC STUBBORNNESS THAT CAUSED THE SITUATION
TO DETERIORATE TO THIS POINT."

   IN A COMMUNIQUE READ BY FOREIGN MINISTER DIEGO CORDOVEZ, WHO WAS
HEAD OF THE OAS MISSION THAT TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MEDIATE IN
PANAMA'S POLITICAL CRISIS, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDED AN
IMMEDIATE END TO THE "FOREIGN INTERVENTION" AND "FULL RESPECT FOR
PANAMANIAN INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY."

   HOWEVER, THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED IT "ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY" THAT A "DEMOCRATIC REGIME" RESTORE INSTITUTIONAL NORMALCY
IN PANAMA AND GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR THE TORRIJOS - CARTER TREATIES.

   AFTER A PRIVATE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA, CORDOVEZ
REITERATED THE OFFICIAL OFFER TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY NEGOTIATING
EFFORTS THAT MIGHT BE INITIATED "TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT IN PANAMA."

   BY MANDATE OF THE ASSEMBLY OF AMERICAN FOREIGN MINISTERS, IN MAY
AND AUGUST CORDOVEZ HEADED EFFORTS TO FIND A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO
THE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE REGIME'S ANNULMENT OF THE 7 MAY ELECTIONS,
PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED AS A CLEAR OPPOSITION
VICTORY.

   "INTENSIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE TO PREVENT THE CONFLICT THAT HAS
EXPLODED TODAY," CORDOVEZ SAID.  HE REITERATED HIS "BROADEST
WILLINGNESS" TO "CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE SEARCH FOR A NONVIOLENT
SOLUTION."

CALL TO ALL LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN HIS
COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CERDA] WE DEFINITELY CALL ON THE WORLD, ON THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD, TO END THIS SITUATION.

   [REPORTER] IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATY COULD
BE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS CONFLICT THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR
SOME TIME BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE PANAMANIAN STATE.  DO
YOU BELIEVE, AS A CITIZEN, THAT THERE IS A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION TO THIS
CONFLICT?

   [CERDA] THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
TOWARD PANAMANIANS.  I BELIEVE THAT NO PEOPLE, NO MAN, INDEPENDENTLY
OF WHAT HE MAY THINK OF THE GOVERNMENTS, CAN AGREE WITH THIS TYPE OF
INTERVENTION BY THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL POWER DIRECTED AGAINST A
SMALL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONFRONT THE MILITARY
MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES
REPORTS, CIVILIANS ARE BEING KILLED THERE ARE MANY MILITIAMEN WHO ARE
FIGHTING THE U.S. SOLDIERS.  I REITERATE MY CALL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE
WORLD, ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE, ON OUR PERUVIAN BROTHERS TO
DECLARE THEMSELVES AGAINST THIS ACT OF AGGRESSION THAT CANNOT BE
TOLERATED BY FREE NATIONS.

   [REPORTER] IN PANAMA, WHERE ARE THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE?

   [CERDA] IN PANAMA CITY.  INTERNATIONAL PRESS DISPATCHES HAVE
MENTIONED THIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE SOCIAL COST SO FAR?  IS THERE SOME ESTIMATE?

   [CERDA] WELL, INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES SPEAK OF 50 DEAD, MOSTLY
CIVILIANS.  FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH
HOSPITAL, THERE HAS BEEN NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT
BEEN GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION, NOR FROM OTHER HOSPITALS.

SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN REBELS AND SOLDIERS
BROKE OUT THIS EVENING IN CIUDAD MERLIOT, AN AREA WEST OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   THE FIGHTING BEGAN AT 1830 (0030 GMT) WHEN FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] COLUMNS ENTERED CIUDAD MERLIOT, A MIDDLE CLASS
NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 12 KM SOUTHWEST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE FIGHTING WAS REPORTED IN THE AREAS
OF JARDINES DE LA HACIENDA AND JARDINES DEL VOLCAN, WHERE THE
GOVERNMENT TROOPS ARE USING AIR SUPPORT.  THE HELICOPTERS FIRED
ROCKETS AGAINST SUPPOSED REBEL POSITIONS.

   THE SHOOTING COULD BE HEARD IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR. MEANWHILE,
RESIDENTS OF THE AFFECTED AREAS TOLD LOCAL RADIO STATIONS THAT THERE
WAS HEAVY SHOOTING.

   THE ARMED ACTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN IN MID- NOVEMBER.  ACCORDING TO ARMY

CASUALTIES NOT INCLUDED.

   LIMA, 20 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] IN BARRANCA
DISTRICT THIS AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA REITERATED HIS REJECTION AND
THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE'S CONDEMNATION OF THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY U.S.  TROOPS.

   THE HEAD OF STATE DESCRIBED THIS ACTION AS AN ACT OF ROBBERY AND
PIRACY.  HE NOTED THAT THIS REPRESENTS AGGRESSION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE BUT AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL LATIN AMERICA.

   GARCIA SAID THAT THIS INSULT AND OUTRAGE AGAINST SOVEREIGN PEOPLES
CANNOT OCCUR ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GARCIA] A DRAMATIC EVENT IS SHAKING ALL LATIN
AMERICA AT THIS MOMENT. BEGINNING EARLY THIS MORNING, THE INVADING
FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE PENETRATED AND INTERVENED
IN LATIN AMERICAN TERRITORY IN PANAMA.

   THIS IS WHY I AM LATE, BECAUSE SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING WE HAVE
BEEN WITNESSING AN ASTONISHING ACT OF IMPERIALIST ROBBERY AND PIRACY
TARNISHING THE SACRED SOIL OF PANAMA AND LATIN AMERICA.

   WE ARE JUST LATIN AMERICANS. IF A LATIN AMERICAN IS OFFENDED AND
ATTACKED, THEN WE ARE ALL OFFENDED AND ATTACKED. AND YOU, THE HUANCA
PEASANTS, MUST KNOW THAT IN PANAMA IN THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THERE ARE
ALSO PEASANTS WHO ARE NOW THE VICTIMS OF THE U.S. INVASION. AND WE
MUST STAND UP TO RESCUE [WORDS DROWNED OUT CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

   SEVENTY YEARS ELAPSED BEFORE GENERAL OMAR TORRIJOS MANAGED TO SIGN
AN AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER FOR THE PANAMA CANAL TO BE
TURNED OVER TO PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY.  SINCE THAT 1977 TREATY,
HOWEVER, MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND EFFORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MADE
TO PREVENT THE CANAL FROM BEING RETURNED TO LATIN AMERICA.

   THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE CANAL ZONE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR
TROOPS, THEIR AIRPLANES, AND THEIR BOMBS TO THREATEN THE CONTINENT AND
TELL ALL OF US THAT IF WE DO NOT BEHAVE WELL THEY CAN INVADE US AT ANY
MOMENT.

   I CANNOT ACCEPT WHAT WAS DONE THIS MORNING WHEN THE NEW PRESIDENT
OF PANAMA WAS SWORN IN ON A U.S. BASE IN THE CANAL ZONE.  THE
AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHO IS GOING TO GOVERN IN LATIN
AMERICA; ONLY THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THEIR
DESTINY.  APPLAUSE AND CHEERS

   IN THE LAST 14 HOURS, 24,000 MEN AND MORE THAN 100 COMBAT VEHICLES
HAVE ENTERED PANAMA CITY, AND THE HELICOPTERS HAVE ATTACKED MILITARY
INSTALLATIONS ADJACENT TO THE CIVILIAN ZONES.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT
HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN KILLED.  AS PRESIDENT OF PERU, AS A CHIEF OF STATE,
AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POOR PEASANTS I CANNOT SILENCE OUR
PROTEST.  I CANNOT SILENCE OUR CONDEMNATION.

   I CALL ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE; I CALL ON THE YOUTH OF LATIN
AMERICA IN THE FACE OF THIS IMPERIALISTIC ATTACK.  WE CANNOT REMAIN
SILENT.  WE MAY BE POOR, WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT WE ARE DIGNIFIED
PEOPLE, WE ARE FREE, WE ARE SOVEREIGN [DROWNED OUT BY APPLAUSE].  [END

   SAN SALVADOR, 20 DEC 89 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN JOINT STAFF, HAS STATED THAT THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] DOES NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE TO LAUNCH A NEW OFFENSIVE BECAUSE THE RANK-AND-FILE OF THIS
ORGANIZATION ARE TOTALLY DEMORALIZED DUE TO THE HEAVY CASUALTIES THAT THEY
HAVE TAKEN.  HE ADDED THAT THESE CASUALTIES INCLUDE NINE "COMMANDERS."

   COL PONCE ADDED: "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEFEATED THE FMLN IN THE
NORTHERN ZONE AND IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN,
CAUSING IN THE PROCESS OVER 2,000 CASUALTIES INCLUDING SEVERAL
COMMANDERS AND MERCENARIES."

   THE FMLN HAS PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT "COMMANDERS" HERNAN SOLORZANO
("DIMAS RODRIGUEZ"), JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL ("OSCAR"), GEOMAR ARI
("CIRILO"), OVIDIO LOPEZ ("ORLANDO MORALES"), AND "POLITICAL OFFICERS"
JOSE SANTOS LLANES ("PEPE") AND MILAGROS ALVARADO ("JUDY"), HAVE BEEN
KILLED.

   TERRORIST LEADERS MISAEL GALLARDO, NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA, AND
RICARDO MIRANDA HAVE ALSO BEEN KILLED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
FAILED FMLN OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   COL PONCE REPORTED THAT MANY MERCENARIES, INCLUDING SOME WHO LOOKED
EUROPEAN, DIED DURING THE CLASH WITH THE ARMY IN COLONIA ESCALON.
PONCE ADDED THAT THE FAMILIES OF THESE MERCENARIES ARE NOW INQUIRING
ABOUT THEM IN NICARAGUA.

   COL PONCE BELIEVES THAT THE SABOTAGE WHICH THE FMLN IS CARRYING OUT
BY BURNING BUSSES, DESTROYING POWER PYLONS, AND STAGING SMALL- SCALE
ATTACKS, ARE MERELY THE "LAST KICKS" OF A DROWNING PERSON.

   ASSISTED BY THE AIR FORCE, THE SALVADORAN ARMY CONTINUES TO STRIKE
AT THE FEW TERRORISTS STRONGHOLDS IN THE NORTH, PARTS OF THE CAPITAL,
AND OTHER AREAS IN THE INTERIOR.

   PONCE INDICATED THAT THE FMLN IS SPREADING LIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
MAINTAIN ITS CREDIBILITY AND TO COVER UP THE HEAVY CASUALTIES IT HAS
TAKEN.  THE CASUALTIES REALLY NUMBER OVER 2,000 ALTHOUGH THE FMLN
CLAIMS ONLY TO HAVE LOST 400 PEOPLE.

   THE OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES REPORT ISSUED ON 30 NOVEMBER STATES THAT
THE FMLN SUSTAINED 2,132 KILLED IN ACTION DURING THE OFFENSIVE WHILE
THE GOVERNMENT LOST 476 TROOPS.

   COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES INTO THE DEATH OF
FOUR PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE CRASH OF A PLANE THAT WAS BRINGING ARMS
FOR THE FMLN FROM NICARAGUA.  THE CRASH OCCURED IN AN ISOLATED AREA OF
USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   UNTIL YESTERDAY THE FMLN HAD NOT ADMITTED THAT THE CREW OF THE
PLANE CARRYING ARMS THAT CRASHED ON 25 SEPTEMBER BELONGED TO TERRORIST
GROUPS.  ACCORDING TO THE FMLN THE CREW MEMBERS WERE SALVADORANS.

   THE TERRORISTS REPORTED THAT THE DEAD CREWMEN WERE PILOT OSVALDO
ALFARO AGUINADA, ALSO KNOWN AS "LUIS" AND "ANTIAIRCRAFT GUNNERS" ROMEL
HERNANDEZ ARGUETA ("HELO"), ISIDRO PARADA MARTINEZ ("DENIS"), AND
SANTIAGO RAUDA POSADA ("WILLIAM").

   COL PONCE STATED THAT THIS "RUMOR IS A COMMUNIST MANEUVER TO MAKE
SURE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA DOES NOT GET BLAMED IN THE LIGHT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SUBVERSIVE CAMPAIGN
IN AREA COUNTRIES."

   PONCE ADDED THAT THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF THE DEFEATED FMLN IS
LIMITED TO TALKING ABOUT FALSE VICTORIES TO NEWS MEDIA THAT THEY
CONTROL, SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR RANK-AND-FILE; TO REFUTING ARMY
REPORTS; AND TO DISSEMINATING FALSE FIGURES ON CASUALTIES ALLEGEDLY
INFLICTED TO THE ARMY.

INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES [BRIGADAS DE PAZ INTERNACIONALES] ASSIGNED TO
GUATEMALA WERE ATTACKED YESTERDAY BY ALLEGED CRIMINALS WHO STABBED THEM NEAR
THE THEIR BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS ON MARISCAL STREET IN THIS CAPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, THE
VICTIMS WERE TWO CANADIAN WOMEN AND AN AMERICAN MALE CITIZEN.

   THE REPORT STATES THAT THE THREE MEMBERS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR
HEADQUARTERS WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED AND ATTACKED BY TWO YOUNG MEN
WHO STABBED THEM.  THE AGGRESSORS FIRST STABBED THE TWO WOMEN IN THE
CHEST, CAUSING DEEP WOUNDS.  THE AMERICAN MAN TRIED TO DEFEND THE TWO
WOMEN BUT HE SUFFERED CUTS ON HIS HANDS AND WRISTS, AND AROUND HIS
WAIST.

   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES IN GUATEMALA REPORT STATES:

   WE CONSIDER THAT THE ATTACK ON THEIR MEMBERS REPRESENTS AN ACTION
OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THIS ORGANIZATION AND THE HUMANITARIAN TASK IT
CARRIES OUT IN GUATEMALA.  THE AGGRESSORS DID NOT ASK FOR MONEY OR TRY
TO STEAL ANYTHING FROM THE THREE VICTIMS.  DURING THE ATTACK THE WOMEN
DROPPED THEIR PURSES AND THE ATTACKERS DID NOT TRY TO STEAL THEM.

   WE CONSIDER THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK IN THE ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE TO INTIMIDATE THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, WHOSE
PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS SINCE MAY.  TWO GRENADES
WERE HURLED AT THE ORGANIZATION'S HEADQUARTERS IN AUGUST.

   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES ARE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
THAT PROMOTES THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NON-VIOLENCE, SEEKING PEACE
THROUGH NON-VIOLENT MEANS.  THIS PEACE INVOLVES NEGOTIATION, DIALOGUE,
AND OTHER NON-VIOLENT METHODS.

   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES DO NOT INTERFERE IN GUATEMALAN
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS OR IN THE ACTIVITIES OF ANY GUATEMALAN ORGANIZATION.
THEY ONLY GIVE HUMANITARIAN HELP AND MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT ATTITUDE.

CASTRO ARENAS TODAY ASKED THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT TO SEND MILITARY
PLANES TO PANAMA TO EVACUATE PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO ARE IN DANGER.

   THE AMBASSADOR TOLD A LOCAL RADIO STATION THAT HE HAD URGED
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TO SEND PLANES THAT COULD ALSO BRING
FOOD AND MEDICINE TO THE PANAMANIANS.

   CASTRO ARENAS, WHO HAS BEEN IN LIMA SINCE AUGUST THIS YEAR,
RECALLED BY HIS GOVERNMENT, SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING HE RECEIVED A
DESPERATE CALL FROM A GROUP OF PERUVIAN CITIZENS WHO WERE AFRAID THAT
THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED BY A MOB OF PANAMANIANS.

   THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS "WIDESPREAD LOOTING" IN
PANAMA BECAUSE THE POOREST PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE
SITUATION IS ONE OF "CHAOS AND ANARCHY AND NOT OF TRANQUILLITY AS THE
PEOPLE IN LIMA BELIEVE."

   CASTRO ARENAS EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACKS ON BUILDINGS FROM WHICH
U.S. SOLDIERS ARE BEING RESISTED IS CONSTANTLY THREATENING THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE SAID THAT HE COULD HEAR "THE BOMBS GOING OFF"
OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   CASTRO ARENAS SAID THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 3,000 PERUVIANS IN
PANAMA.  HE ADDED THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA BUT DID NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT NUMBER.  HE
ALSO SAID THAT "THERE IS NO ONE THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM."

   ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, THE PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS ARE ALL BLOCKED
AT THEIR HOMES; THEIR CARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND ONE OF THEM HAS
BEEN WOUNDED BY A GUNSHOT.

   CASTRO ARENAS SAID THAT HE IS CONSTANTLY RECEIVING CALLS THAT KEEP
HIM INFORMED OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN PANAMA.  HE SAID THAT THE NATIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING SO MUCH CONCERN OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
PANAMA SHOULD START URGENTLY SENDING FOOD AND MEDICINE AND "NOT STOP
AT MERE DECLARATIONS."

   BEIJING (PRC), 15 DEC 89 (JIEFANGJUN BAO) -- [TEXT] FROM 10 TO 12
DECEMBER, PRESIDENTS OF FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HELD A SPECIAL
MEETING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS.  BUT SO
FAR NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED BY BOTH SIDES ON BRINGING ABOUT A
CEASE-FIRE DURING CHRISTMAS.  THEIR 1-MONTH-LONG FIERCE BATTLE HAS LEFT
3,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND ALSO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE
PROCESS.

   THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS TRIGGERED OFF BY THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LABOR FEDERATION, THE COUNTRY'S
BIGGEST TRADE UNION ORGANIZATION.  ON 31 OCTOBER, AN ULTRARIGHTIST
"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY USED
A HEAVY BOMB TO BOMBARD THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE LABOR
FEDERATION, KILLING AND WOUNDING OVER 40 PEOPLE INCLUDING PRINCIPAL
LEADERS OF THE FEDERATION.  ON 2 NOVEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A
STATEMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ACTIVITY OF THE SQUAD AND
DECLARING THE CANCELLATION OF THE THIRD ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT SCHEDULED IN VENEZUELA.  ON THE SAME NIGHT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE "TO ELIMINATE FASCISM."  ABOUT 8,000
GUERRILLAS SWIFTLY CAPTURED MANY TOWNS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS
NORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL AND CUT KEY COMMUNICATIONS LINES BETWEEN THE
CAPITAL AND THE HINTERLAND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO ATTACKED SOME
50 GOVERNMENT ARMY BASES AND POLICE STATIONS IN THE HINTERLAND, THUS
CONTROLLING 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY.  THEY HAVE
ESTABLISHED "LOCAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS" IN 8 OF THE 14 PROVINCES
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING THIS PERIOD, THE GOVERNMENT DISPATCHED
ARMORED CARS AND AIR FORCE UNITS TO CARRY OUT COUNTERATTACKS.  THEY
WANTONLY BOMBARDED THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY
OCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS.  AFTER 8 DAYS OF FIERCE BATTLE, THE
GUERRILLAS SHOT DOWN 12 GOVERNMENT FIGHTER PLANES AND HELICOPTERS;
DESTROYED 34 TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND PATROL CARS; AND CAPTURED A
LARGE AMOUNT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  SUBSEQUENTLY BATTLES CONTINUED
IN REGIONS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY.  SINCE EARLY DECEMBER BOTH SIDES
HAVE ENGAGED IN FIERCE BATTLES IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE HINTERLAND.
THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS TO ATTACK THE BUILDING OF THE GOVERNMENT
ARMY GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, THE U.S.  EMBASSY, AND THE
PRESIDENTIAL RESTAURANT, WHEREAS THE GOVERNMENT ARMY DISPATCHED PLANES
TO BOMBARD THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS.  FIERCE BATTLES HAVE ALSO BROKEN
OUT IN CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND OTHER TOWNS, THEREBY CAUSING
HEAVY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY LOSSES.

   THIS WAR HAS DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES.  EL SALVADOR IS A SMALL COUNTRY
WITH AN AREA OF 21,000 SQUARE KM AND A POPULATION OF 5 MILLION.
DURING THIS 10-YEAR-LONG WAR, 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DESTROYED.  THE ULTRARIGHTIST NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] WON THE GENERAL ELECTION EARLY THIS YEAR,
THUS AGGRAVATING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE
GOVERNMENT.  PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE GUERRILLAS PUT FORWARD A PEACE
PROPOSAL DEMANDING SIX MONTHS' POSPONEMENT OF THE ELECTION SO AS TO
MAKE THEIR PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE.  BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT.  BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS DID NOT VOTE, THE
GUERRILLAS DECLARED IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.
PRESSED BY DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION AND URGED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEACE AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS HELD TWO ROUNDS OF
TALKS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.  DURING THEIR TALKS THE GUERRILLAS
DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP ITS SUPPRESSION, INTRODUCE
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, REORGANIZE THE ARMED
FORCES, AND PUNISH THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD."  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED
THAT THE GUERRILLAS SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS BEFORE REFORMS WERE
CARRIED OUT.  THE HARD-LINE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTED THE
ESTABLISHED POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY, WHICH HAS ALL ALONG STOOD FOR
RULING THE COUNTRY BY MILITARY MEANS, ADVOCATED THE SUPPRESSION OF
DEMOCRATIC FORCES, AND SUPPORTED THE "DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN CARRYING
OUT ASSASSINATION.  A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA WAS
ASSASSINATED BY THE SQUAD FOR CRITICIZING THE ULTRARIGHTIST POLICY OF
THE RULING PARTY.  RECENTLY THE RULING PARTY SUPPORTED THE
"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD" IN ATTACKING THE LABOR FEDERATION'S BUILDING.
THIS IGNITED THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS IN
THE COUNTRY. THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A STATEMENT ON 12 DECEMBER
CONDEMNING THE MEETING OF THE FIVE HEADS OF STATE FOR BEING PARTIAL TO
THE ULTRARIGHTIST SALVADORIAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT
THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY EFFORT TO DISSOLVE THE GUERRILLA FORCES AND
WOULD CARRY ON THEIR STRUGGLE.  [CONTINUED]

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY CALLED THE
GUATEMALAN PEOPLE TO "THINK" DURING CHRISTMAS ABOUT THE PANAMANIAN,
SALVADORAN, AND ROMANIAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A "DIFFICULT"
SITUATION.

   DURING A MESSAGE DELIVERED THROUGH A NATIONAL NETWORK, CEREZO SAID
THAT "CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL TIME TO SIT AROUND WITH THE FAMILY AND
REFLECT UPON THE FUTURE AND THE GOALS ONE WISHES TO ATTAIN."

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "I WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT WITH YOU, BECAUSE
WHEN ONE TAKES A LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, ONE SEES THE GREAT
DIFFICULTIES THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING TO ACHIEVE AND
BUILD DEMOCRACY."

   CEREZO MENTIONED THE CASE OF ROMANIA, WHERE WORKERS WHO WERE
DEMONSTRATING TO DEMAND WAGE INCREASES AND A DEMOCRATIZING PROCESS
WERE SHOT BY THE SECURITY FORCES RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEAD AND
WOUNDED.

   CEREZO ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CRISIS PANAMA IS CURRENTLY
EXPERIENCING AND SAID THAT NOW THE "PANAMANIAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A VERY SAD CHRISTMAS AND WILL FACE MANY DIFFICULTIES TO GET
FOOD."

   PRESIDENT CEREZO STRESSED THAT "PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED THROUGH
DIALOGUE, THAT WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED AND THAT GUATEMALA MUST PREVENT
DISASTER FROM REACHING THE COUNTRY, AS HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER NATIONS."

   CEREZO ADMITTED THAT GUATEMALA IS PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO SOLVE ITS
ECONOMIC SITUATION, BUT HE STRESSED THAT ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD
HAD TO PAY HIGH PRICES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS.

   CEREZO STRESSED THAT "JAPAN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXPERIENCED A WORLD WAR.  GERMANY ALSO
EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT TIMES AND LEARNED THE LESSON THAT THE WAR DID
NOT BRING ANY BENEFITS TO THEM."

   CEREZO SAID THAT THE 4 YEARS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS
INAUGURATED IN JANUARY 1986, "HAVE BEEN TRULY INTERESTING."  HE SAID
THAT HE HAS FACED PROBLEMS AND THAT HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED, BUT HE
ADDED THAT THE CRISIS, HOWEVER, IS BEING SOLVED THROUGH DIALOGUE.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO ADDED THAT THE ECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY HIS
GOVERNMENT HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF LIVING.  CEREZO SAID THAT
GUATEMALA IS ONE OF THE THREE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE
REGISTERED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE BUSINESSES, STORES,
AND EMPLOYMENT HERE.

HAVE REPORTED THAT 55 ECUADOREANS, INCLUDING ECUADORAN AGRICULTURE MINISTER
MARIO JALIL, WERE EVACUATED LAST NIGHT FROM PANAMA IN AN AIRPLANE FROM THEIR

   THE AIRPLANE, WHICH IS THE FIRST TO LAND IN PANAMA AFTER THE U.S.
MILITARY INTERVENTION, LANDED A CARGO OF MEDICINE AT OMAR TORRIJOS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AFTER FIRST HAVING LANDED AT THE U.S. HOWARD

   AN ECUADORAN DIPLOMAT SAID THAT "THE AIRPORT SMELLED OF DEAD
BODIES."  THE NEARBY TOCUMEN AIR BASE WAS THE BATTLEGROUND FOR HARSH
CLASHES BETWEEN U.S. AND PANAMANIAN TROOPS, AND IT WAS BOMBED BY THE
UNITED STATES.

   AN AIRPLANE FROM MEXICO ALSO ARRIVED IN PANAMA LAST NIGHT BRINGING

THE ILLUSION I HAD THAT RELATIONS WERE CHANGING AT THE POLTICAL LEVEL.
FIRST, I WOULD NOT ALLOW A HARDENING OF PERU ATTITUDE TOWARD THE
UNITED STATES.  THERE IS A HARDENING WHEN ONE SLAPS SOMEONE ELSE IN
THE FACE.  IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A CONCRETE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION.
THERE IS A GREAT ISSUE TO DISCUSS BETWEEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE UNITED
STATES.  YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVADE.  WHO CALLED YOU?  ENDARA
HIMSELF HAD TO SAY -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE
THINKING, THOUGH A PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE INDIFFERENT -- THAT HE DID
NOT CALL THEM.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?  PRESIDENT ENDARA SAYS
THAT HE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE INVASION.  THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY
UNDERSTOOD. FOR SOME REASON HE SAID IT.  SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT A
HARDENING. I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT SHADE OF THE TERM. WE ARE
ENERGIC IN OPPOSING A CONCRETE FACT, BUT WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE
OF JEFFERSON, OF WHITMAN, OF LINCLON -- THAT GREAT DEFENDER OF HUMAN
RIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY -- WHAT HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ACT?
WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE GREATNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM LATIN
AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN IN VARIOUS WAYS. FOR THE TIME
BEING, I SEE IT AS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THE LATIN AMERICANS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.
THE LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE HAS TO SEEN INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.
THEN A SOUND RELATIONSHINP WILL EMERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTINENTS.
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD -- FOR THE
CAPACITY OF ITS ATOMIC LEGIONS; FOR THEIR HAVING CONCENTRATED SCIENCE
AND PHILOSOPHY, ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE AS THE
ROMANS BROUGHT THEM FROM GREECE; FOR THEIR HAVING GENERATED AN
EXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR THEIR BEING A DEMOCRACY -- THE
UNITED STATES MUST BE RESPECTED.  WE WILL HAVE TO DISTINGUISH ALL THAT
FROM A PARTICULAR ACT BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHY WE SAY
AMERICANS REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY YANKEE
TO DEFINE SOME ACTS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE,
SIR, THAT THERE IS A HARDENING, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY
UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL THEM
THAT I CANNOT SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. LET THE MINISTERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS, THE
PROSECUTORS, THE ATTORNEY GENERALS SIT AT A TABLE.  THAT IS GOOD.  BUT
THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION?  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I
THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR MR MANTILLA TO SIT WITH MR BENNETT OR WITH
THE JUSTICE MINISTER OF COLOMBIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE BAD.
THIS IS THE PROOF THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE ANTIDRUG PLAN. BUT
THOSE WHO PERSONIFY THE NATION CANNOT MEET.  WE CANNOT DO SO UNDER THE
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  SO THIS IS NOT HARDENING.  AS FOR THE IMF, I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT MATTER.  THESE MATTERS ARE
WELL DIFFERENTIATED. I AM NOT HERE AS A DEMAGOGUE, AS SOME RIGHT WING
MEDIA ASSERT.  THOSE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTENED WHEN I DRAW A LOT OF PEOPLE
DESPITE MY POLTICAL DECLINE.  I AM NOT BEING A DEMAGOGUE, AND I AM NOT
HERE BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO WIN VOTES IS TO INDULGE IN ANTI-AMERICAN
POLITICS FROM HERE UNTIL 28 JULY 1990. I WILL NOT LAPSE INTO THAT
IRRESPONSIBILITY. HERE WE HAVE A CONCRETE FACT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THE UNITED STATES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE INFLUENCE.
I SEPARATE THINGS VERY WELL.  [CONTINUED]

   BUENOS AIRES, 28 DEC 89 (TELAM) -- [TEXT] THE ARGENTINE CHAMBER OF
DEPUTIES TODAY "STRONGLY REPUDIATED" THE U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION IN
PANAMA BY APPROVING A DECLARATION SPONSORED BY THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY
(PJ) AND THE RADICAL CIVIC UNION (UCR) BLOCS.  THE PROPOSAL MET WITH
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC CENTRIST UNION (UCEDE) DEPUTIES.

   THE DECLARATION PROPOSED BY PJ DEPUTY JUAN PABLO CAFIERO CALLS FOR
THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS THAT INVADED PANAMA TO
OUST GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA'S GOVERNMENT.

   IT ALSO URGES THE UNITED STATES TO "STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE
TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATIES" ON THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CANAL.  THE
DECLARATION REJECTS ALL TYPES OF DICTATORIAL REGIMES, IMPLICITLY
REFERRING TO NORIEGA.

   THIS STATEMENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DECLARATION AT THE SUGGESTION OF
FEDERAL PARTY DEPUTY RUTH MONJARDIN AFTER OBTAINING THE SUPPORT OF
JOSE MANZANO, THE SPEAKER FOR THE PJ BLOC; SATURNINO ARANA (PJ),
CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE; AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE
CAPUTO.

   THE DECLARATION ALSO RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF INTRANSIGENT PARTY
DEPUTY OSCAR ALENDE, CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY HECTOR GATTI,
AND POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEPUTY ALBERTO ARAMOUNI.  DEPUTY LUIS
ZAMORA OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM REJECTED THE DECLARATION ON
THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS MEANINGLESS "TO ASK ANYTHING OF A COUNTRY THAT
IS KILLING PANAMANIANS."

   THE UCEDE OPPOSED THE DECLARATION, AND BLOC SPEAKER FEDERICO
CLERICI WAS MOCKED BY PJ AND UCR DEPUTIES WHEN HE READ AN ALTERNATE
DECLARATION PREPARED BY UCEDE DEPUTY ADELINA DALESSIO DE VIOLA, WHICH
URGED THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND PANAMA TO "STOP
USING VIOLENCE."

   UCEDE DEPUTY FRANCISCO DURANONA Y VEDIA CRITICIZED THE DECLARATION
BY STATING THAT IT IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR GENERAL NORIEGA'S REGIME.
DEPUTY FEDERICO ZAMORA, ALSO FROM THE UCEDE, LAMENTED THAT "THERE ARE
SO MANY FORGETFUL PEOPLE HERE.  A LOT IS BEING SAID ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN PANAMA, BUT NOTHING IS BEING SAID ABOUT ROMANIA."

   FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND UCR DEPUTY DANTE CAPUTO SUPPORTED THE
DECLARATION AND SAID THAT "TO ACCEPT THE U.S. INVASION WOULD BE
TANTAMOUNT TO ADMITTING THAT THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS," ADDING THAT
SUCH IDEAS MUST BE REJECTED, EVEN THOUGH PANAMA MAY HAVE HAD AN
"ILLEGAL, DICTATORIAL AND CORRUPT" GOVERNMENT.

   TOWARD THE END OF THE DEBATE, PJ BLOC SPEAKER JOSE MANZANO SAID
THAT "BY CRITICIZING THIS SAVAGERY WE SEEK TO HELP RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA [LE HACEMOS UN FAVOR A LA RELACION
DE ESTADOS UNIDOS CON AMERICA LATINA].  HE ADDED THAT THE UNITED
STATES HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR THE DESIRE FOR FREEDOM OF TALL
BLOND EAST GERMANS AND OF SHORT DARK PANAMANIANS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 DEC 89 (LA PRENSA GRAFICA) -- [TEXT] FATHER JOSE MARIA
TOJEIRA S.J. [SOCIETY OF JESUS], THE JESUIT PROVINCIAL SPOKESMAN FOR
CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS RELEASED A NOTE DENYING INEXACT REPORTS ON THE CASE OF
THE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT THEY NOT WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA
SYMPATHIZERS.

   THE NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS:

   23 DECEMBER 1989

   PROV. 264/89

   DIRECTOR DUTRIZ

   DIRECTOR OF LA PRENSA GRAFICA

   SAN SALVADOR

   DEAR MR.DIRECTOR:

   THE NEWSPAPER WHICH YOU DIRECT, ON 21 DECEMBER 1989, PUBLISHED ON
PAGES 6 AND 7 TWO ARTICLES ON THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THAT WERE
MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.  THESE ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THEY DISTORT THE REALITY OF THE CASE OR THEY INCORRECTLY DESCRIBE
THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS.

   ON PAGE 6 AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE," WHICH IS
SIGNED BY MR. LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT "THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST
GUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK "IS
KNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS."

   THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF "THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL
POSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE."

   I WISH TO STATE THAT:

   1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST
GUERRILLAS.  THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN
CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE
WITH JUSTICE.

   2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA [CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS,
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY
FOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE.  THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT
THE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE
AND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO
NOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH.

   3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT "NEOMARXIST" IN THE
PHILOSOPHICAL FIELD.  FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE
SPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN
CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.  FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS
ON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL.  THE "ZUBIRIAN"
INCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST
PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS.  THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF
HAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING
THEIR IGNORANCE.

   4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA
BEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER.  WE
THEREFORE CONSIDER THEIR REPETITION TO BE A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.

   ON PAGE 7, AND IN AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE, THE NEWSPAPER MENTIONS THE
NEED TO AVOID "THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY PRIVATE PSEUDO-INVESTIGATIONS,
WHEREVER THEY MIGHT COME FROM."  ON THIS STATEMENT I WANT TO SIMPLY
ADD THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE INJURED PARTY HAS EVERY RIGHT, BOTH
IN EL SALVADOR AND IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD, TO CONDUCT ITS OWN
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION.  FURTHERMORE, UNLESS PUBLICLY AND IRREFUTABLY
PROVEN HARMFUL, NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONDEMN IT "IN ADVANCE" SAYING
THAT IT IS PLAYING DETECTIVES.

   I BEG OF YOU MR. DIRECTOR, BASED ON THE RIGHT TO REPLY AND THE
JUSTICE THAT THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEM
DESERVE, THAT YOU PUBLISH THIS CLARIFICATIONS IN YOUR NEWSPAPER WITH
THE SAME DESIRE TO REACH YOUR READERS AS THOSE WHO WROTE THE ARTICLES.

   YOURS TRULY.

   FATHER JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA

   SOCIETY OF JESUS PROVINCIAL."

   TEGUCIGALPA, 31 DEC 89 (TELEVISORA HONDURENA) -- [SPEECH] [HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE SIMEON AZCONA HOYO] [EXCERPTS] COUNTRYMEN: NOW THAT THE
NEW YEAR IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY, WE APPEAR BEFORE THE NATION, AS WE HAVE
DONE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, TO EXPRESS OUR MOST
SINCERE WISHES FOR THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF ALL HONDURAN PEOPLE. OUR
GREATEST WISH IS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE NATION, WITHOUT EXCEPTION,
TO ENJOY WELL- BEING AND PEACE AT HOME. WE CAN AFFIRM THAT DURING OUR
TENURE WE HAVE CONSTANTLY STRIVEN TOWARD THE HIGHER GOALS OF
COLLECTIVE PROGRESS AND WELL-BEING IN THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WE HAVE
FACED DURING THESE 4 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT -- SITUATIONS THAT ARE
NATURAL TO A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE OURS.

   ON 25 JANUARY 1990 WE WILL PRESENT TO CONGRESS A REPORT SUMMING UP
THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION. THUS, ALL THE PEOPLE
WILL BE TRUTHFULLY INFORMED OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OF THE PROJECTS
THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SO THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP
MATERIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HISTORICAL
EVOLUTION TO WHICH WE ASPIRE, BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A STATE.
[PASSAGE OMITTED]

   WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE AT SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN
SUMMITS, WHERE WE DEFENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND CONDEMNED ANY
FORM OF TOTALITARIANISM AS WELL AS THE TERRORIST ACTIONS THAT HAVE
CAUSED MANY DEATHS AND BROUGHT SORROW TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE.

   I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THE TELA SUMMIT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AMERICA, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE
COUNTRIES PLAGUED BY VIOLENCE.

   WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT GREAT SACRIFICES ARE NECESSARY IF WE
ARE TO MAKE SOCIAL PROGRESS, AND WE HAVE CONSTANTLY WORKED TO
ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT.

   OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE LASTING AND HAVE GIVEN THE COUNTRY BETTER
PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.  THAT HAS BEEN OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE.  WE DID
NOT RESORT TO DEMAGOGUERY, AND WE SPOKE THE TRUTH -- DURING THE
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN AND LATER AS THE LEADER OF THE NATION'S DESTINY --
SO AS NOT TO CREATE FALSE EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.  [PASSAGE
OMITTED]

   I WANT TO REASSERT THAT ONCE I STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY, I
WILL CONTINUE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRIVE FOR THE UNITY OF THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE SO THAT WITH EFFORT AND WORK WE MAY IMPROVE OUR LIVING
STANDARDS.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   FINALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS -- FOR THE
WELL-BEING OF THE FATHERLAND -- TO RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS ROMERO,
WHO WILL TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT ON 27 JANUARY L990.  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 2 JAN 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[PRESS AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY] [TEXT] THE PRESS
AND INFORMATION DIRECTORATE OF THE PRESIDENCY ANNOUNCES TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ACCORDING TO
PRELIMINARY REPORTS, ON 1 JANUARY AT 1930, A GROUP OF
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY MERCENARIES, FINANCED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT,
AMBUSHED MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS GROUP HEADED BY MSGR PABLO SMITH,
BISHOP OF THE BLUEFIELDS APOSTOLIC VICARIATE, IN A PLACE KNOWN AS OJO
DE AGUA, LOCATED BETWEEN ARANCHAMBA AND COPERNA, NORTHERN ATLANTIC
REGION, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF NUNS MAUREEN CONNALY, AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, AND TERESA ROSALES MISQUITA.  BISHOP PABLO SMITH AND
FRANCISCA COLOMER MISQUITA WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  THIS IS PART OF
THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT, WHICH INVADED
PANAMA AND CONDUCTED A MILITARY INCURSION INTO THE HOME OF THE
NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR IN THAT COUNTRY.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS, WHICH
ENDANGER THE PEACE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS AND SUPPORTED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.  NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO CONDEMN THIS
BRUTAL CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.  THIS ACTION IS
SIMILAR TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS PERPETRATED IN
SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989 BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH JUST AS
THE COUNTERREVOLUTION AND THE OTHER RIGHTIST NICARAGUAN FORCES,
DEFENDS THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 4 JAN 90 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] THE BLOW DEALT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN CONSCIENCE BY THE U.S.
INTERVENTION IN PANAMA IS ABOUT TO DEFLATE THE OPTIMISTIC HOPES FOR A
JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRADE.  EVEN GEORGE BUSH'S 15 FEBRUARY
MEETING IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF
BOLIVIA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA -- THE LEADING PRODUCERS OF COCA LEAVES --
IS IN JEOPARDY.  PERUVIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE ALAN GARCIA MADE IT KNOWN
THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE MEETING IN PROTEST OF THE PANAMA INVASION.
BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA IS BEING QUESTIONED BY THE
BOLIVIAN SUPREME COURT OVER THE EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES OF
FORMER COLONEL LUIS ARCE GOMEZ.  THE COURT REGARDS PAZ ZAMORA'S
DECISION ON THIS MATTER AS UNDUE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTIONAL POWERS AND
AN ATTACK ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  BOLIVIAN CHIEF JUSTICE EDGAR
OBLITAS CHARGED THAT THE EXTRADITION OF ARCE GOMEZ, WHO WAS A
NOTORIOUS DRUG TRAFFICKER, AN EXECUTIONER AND A PLOTTER, HAS PREVENTED
THE AUTHORITIES FROM CLEARING UP SEVERAL RECENT EVENTS IN BOLIVIAN
HISTORY, WHICH THUS REMAIN JUST PARTIALLY KNOWN.

   FOR ITS PART, COLOMBIA REACTED WITH SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO
REPORTS THAT THE UNITED STATES PLANS TO ESTABLISH AIRSPACE AND NAVAL
PATROLS WITHIN COLOMBIAN JURISDICTION WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH BOGOTA.
THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON STATED LATER THAT THE PATROLS WILL TAKE
PLACE OVER INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND THAT THEY WILL ENTAIL CONCERTED
ACTIONS.  IT IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, THAT AN EVENTUAL BLOCKADE OF THE
COLOMBIAN COAST IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF SPECIAL MEASURES COORDINATED
BY U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY DICK CHENEY.

   THE COLOMBIAN POLICE, WHO HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SEIZING 80
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL AMOUNT OF COCAINE SEIZED WORLDWIDE, HAVE
IN RECENT WEEKS DEALT SEVERE BLOWS TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG LORDS.
THE PUNITIVE U.S. ACTION WOULD IN PRACTICE ENTAIL THAT THE UNITED
STATES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AND WOULD CREATE AN
EMBARRASSING SITUATION FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN A YEAR WHEN
COLOMBIANS WILL ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MAYORS,
DEPARTMENTAL DEPUTIES, AND COUNCILMEN.

   THE CLAIM THAT THE ACTION IS INTENDED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENT
THE DRUG TRADE IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT WILL
NOT BE MATCHED BY EQUIVALENT STIFF MEASURES IN THE COUNTRY HOLDING THE
WORLD RECORD IN DRUG CONSUMPTION AND THAT U.S. TROOPS ARE CURRENTLY
OCCUPYING COLOMBIA'S NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, PANAMA.

   WHERE DOES THE U.S. DESIRE TO CHASE CRIMINALS END AND WHERE DOES
ITS IMPERIALIST DESIRE TO LIMIT LATIN AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TO
DECIDE THE FATE OF OUR PEOPLES START?  THE PANAMANIAN CASE IS AN
EXAMPLE.  IT IS NOT NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT NECESSARY FOR US TO BE
DISTRUSTFUL.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE VIOLENT
AND SURPRISING EVENTS IN VENEZUELA AND ARGENTINA EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH
RESULTED IN THOUSANDS KILLED, ARE AN INDICATION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN
COMING YEARS.  WITH ITS INTERVENTIONIST POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAS
NEGATED OUR PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION AND EMBITTERED THE RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IN THE AREA.  BY PREVENTING THE SOCIAL FORCES FROM
ACTING FREELY, THE UNITED STATES PROLONGS THE WAR AND ELIMINATES THE
POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING TRUE DEMOCRATIZATION.  THE U.S. IMPERIALIST POLICY
HAS WEAKENED IN THE DECADE ENDING TODAY.  LATIN AMERICANISM HAS ADVANCED AND
THE TIME OF A DOCILE AND PUPPET CONTINENT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

   LATIN AMERICAN INTERESTS AND SOCIAL FORCES HAVE MATURED.  DESPITE
30 YEARS OF INVASION AND COMMERCIAL FREEZING, CUBA IS STILL UNBEATEN.
NICARAGUA HAS RESISTED, HAS DEFEATED 10 YEARS OF WAR WAGED BY
MERCENARIES, AND IS PREPARING TO LEGITIMIZE ITS REVOLUTION.  IN EL
SALVADOR, THE 10 YEARS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY WITH WHICH THE UNITED
STATES HAS TRIED TO DEFEAT US AND WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO
IMPOSE ON US HAVE FAILED.  THE INSURGENCY PROBLEMS THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED WITH A FEW ADVISERS AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
REMAIN UNSETTLED IN EL SALVADOR DESPITE A $3 BILLION AID PACKAGE,
NEARLY 1,000 ADVISERS, AND 10 YEARS OF BLOODY WAR.  IN THE PAST THE
PROBLEM OF PANAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH A COUP IN A FEW HOURS'
TIME, BUT NOW 2 YEARS OF ECONOMIC FREEZING, SUBVERSION, BUSINESSMEN'S
STRIKES, ATTACKS, AND THWARTED COUPS WERE NECESSARY.  FINALLY, THE
UNITED STATES HAD TO USE 30,000 MEN, DESTROY A COUNTRY, AND FIGHT FOR
1 WEEK TO BRING TO SUBMISSION AN ARMY AND A MILITARY HEAD THEY
THEMSELVES HAD TRAINED.

   LATIN AMERICANISM IS ON ITS WAY FORWARD.  THE DECADE NOW BEGINNING
BELONGS TO LATIN AMERICA.  THE STRUGGLE IN OUR CONTINENT IS OF AN
ANTI-IMPERIALIST NATURE.  OUR STRUGGLE, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, STARTED IN
CENTRAL AMERICA 10 YEARS AGO WITH THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST
REVOLUTION AND THE BEGINNING OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.  THIS HAS TURNED
THE REGION INTO A TRUE VIETNAM DURING THIS DECADE.  BECAUSE OF ALL
THIS, THE SACRIFICE THAT OUR STRUGGLE ENTAILS IS GREAT AND THE PROCESS
IS COMPLEX, BECAUSE BOTH THE STRUGGLE AND THE PROCESS OCCUR IN A
CHANGING WORLD SITUATION.  WHILE IN EASTERN EUROPE THE AREAS OF
INFLUENCE ARE DISAPPEARING AND THE PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION IS
OPENING TO AN UNHINDERED PATH, THE U.S. EMPIRE WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION AND CLINGS TO ITS NEOCOLONIAL DOMINATION OF LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN.  WHAT IS AT STAKE IN EL SALVADOR IS NOT PRECISELY
COMMUNISM OR CAPITALISM, BUT DEMOCRACY AND THE CONTINENT'S
INDEPENDENCE.  LATIN AMERICA ASPIRES, NOT TO A RESTRICTED SOCIETY, BUT
TO A SELF-SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNAL SOCIAL BALANCE WITH THE
PARTICIPATION OF MANY SOCIAL SECTORS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SOCIETIES
APPEAR TO BE POLARIZED IN THE EYES OF BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS, BUT
THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENCE WILL COALESCE ALL OF THESE FORCES.  IN THIS
CONTEXT, OUR STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FOR SELF - DETERMINATION
AND DEMOCRACY, IS IN THE CAPITALIST WORLD THE SPEARHEAD OF THE
STRUGGLE OF ALL LATIN AMERICAN AND THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, WHICH DEMAND
THESE TRANSFORMATIONS.  ALL THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE THESE YEARS AND
ALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY OUR COMBATANTS, MILITARY COMMANDERS,
POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED EITHER AS DIPLOMATS OR
GUERRILLAS HAS NOW BECOME VERY SIGNIFICANT.  THE CHANGES IN STRATEGY,
THE RESHUFFLING OF PLANS, THE HEROIC RESISTANCE OF THE MASSES, THE
UNITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, THE POLITICAL - IDEOLOGICAL
FLEXIBILITY, THE DEFINITION OF A POLITICAL PLATFORM ADAPTED TO THE
DEMAND OF THE STRUGGLE, THE LARGE NUMBER OF BOTH LOCAL AND
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND ALL THAT HAS
BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE BEST CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE
CONSTITUTE OUR FULL CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRACY AND
SOVEREIGNTY IN EL SALVADOR AND LATIN AMERICA AND HELP MAKE THE
PEOPLE'S VICTORY MORE LIKELY THAN EVER.  [CONTINUED]

REPORTED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMY, WERE ARRESTED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS BECAUSE OF THEIR
SUSPECTED INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX SPANISH JESUITS ON
16 NOVEMBER.

   CITING RELIABLE SOURCES, RADIO CADENA YSKL STATED THIS AFTERNOON
THAT THE SUSPECTED ASSASSINS WERE ARRESTED AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS OF
THE CASE HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT.  U.S., SPANISH, AND BRITISH
INVESTIGATORS PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   IT HAS ALSO BEEN LEARNED THAT PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL
ADDRESS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT OVER A NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION
NETWORK, PRESUMABLY TO REFER TO THIS SUBJECT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF THE SALVADOAN ARMED FORCES' GENERAL
STAFF, HAS ADMITTED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS OF AN
ELITE BATTALION ARE "BEING HELD IN VARIOUS GUARRISONS OF
SAN SALVADOR" WHILE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE KILLING OF THE             
SIX JESUITS CONTINUE.

   ACCORDING TO PONCE, THESE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION
WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE CRIMES INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION, WHICH
IS STUDYING THE CASE OF THE JESUITS WHO WERE SHOT TO DEATH ON 16 NOVEMBER.  

   SPANISH, BRITISH, FRENCH, AND CANADIAN POLICE AGENTS HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THESE SALVADORAN SOLDIERS HAD SEARCHED THE JESUITS' RESIDENCE 2
DAYS BEFORE THE KILLING, PONCE TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY WITHOUT GIVING
MUCH DETAIL.

   HOWEVER, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES STATED THAT THE SOLDIERS WILL BE
"CONFINED" TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GARRISONS AND ADDED THAT THEY INCLUDE
"FIVE OFFICERS."

   FRANCISCO ESTRADA, A SALVADORAN PRIEST WHO WAS APPOINTED NEW RECTOR
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTED THIS CRIME, IS
AN IMPORTANT STEP VERY SELDOM TAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY."  HOWEVER, THIS
"MATTER IS NOT OVER WITH YET."

   "WHAT WOULD REALLY BE NEW IS FOR HIM TO SAY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD OF
JUST SAYING THAT IT WAS THE ARMED FORCES," THE PRIEST TOLD ACAN-EFE
AND ADDED THAT HE TRUSTS IN THE "GOODWILL AND ETHICS" OF PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   EVERY SOURCE CONSULTED WITH BY ACAN-EFE, WHETHER DIPLOMATIC OR
RELIGIOUS, AGREED TO SAY THAT NOW IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CRISTIANI TO
TAKE ONE STEP FURTHER AND MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
THIS MURDER CARRIED OUT AT UCA.

   TWO DOMESTIC SERVANTS (A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER) WERE KILLED
TOGETHER WITH THE CLERGYMEN, FIVE SPANIARDS, INCLUDING UCA RECTOR
IGNACIO ELLACURIA, AND A SALVADORAN.

   THE U.S.  EMBASSY IN EL SALVADOR ALSO CONGRATULATED CRISTIANI TODAY FOR
HIS EFFORTS TO CLARIFY THE ASSASSINATION, AS U.S.  CONGRESSMEN AND OFFICIALS
OF THE [GEORGE] BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD ASKED OF HIM.

   IN FACT, DIPLOMATIC SOURCES COMMENTED TO ACAN-EFE THAT BEGINNING ON 22
JANUARY, THE U.S.  CONGRESS IS TO DISCUSS A NEW $90 MILLION PACKAGE OF
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR THAT MIGHT HINGE ON THE STATUS OF
THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN OVER $3 BILLION IN MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC AID TO EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST DECADE, AND AT PRESENT IT IS
GIVING ABOUT $1.4 MILLION DAILY, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN POLITICAL
SOURCES.

   UCA RECTOR FRANCISCO ESTRADA SAID THAT CRISTIANI COULD TAKE THIS
STEP BECAUSE "HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN CONTROL ANY INTERNAL
RESENTMENT WITHIN HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES."

   A SIMILAR OPINION WAS EXPRESSED BY A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT, WHO TOLD
ACAN-EFE THAT CRISTIANI IS TAKING A GREAT RISK BY ACCUSING MEMBERS OF
THE ARMED FORCES OF THIS CRIME.  HE ADDED: " IF HE HAS DONE THIS, IT
IS BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY SELF-CONFIDENT."

   OBSERVERS COMPARE THE INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE
PRESENT RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT WITH ONE CARRIED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT, INTO THE 1980 MURDER OF
SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   DUARTE, WHO TURNED OVER POWER TO CRISTIANI ON 1 JUNE 1989, ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS ATTRIBUTED THE MURDER OF ARCHBISHOP ROMERO TO ROBERTO D'
AUBUISSON, A PRESENT DEPUTY AND LEADER OF THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE, BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS NEVER LED TO ANY CONCRETE RESULTS.

FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE
AND THAT, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS IS DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SPAIN, THE EEC, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.  BUT, SPEAKING TO RNE,
RUBEN ZAMORA EXPRESSED HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REAL IDENTITY AND
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ZAMORA] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS STILL NOT GIVEN
ANY NAMES AND SO WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALL BASED ON
RUMORS.  THEREFORE, THE FIRST THING TO BE SEEN IS WHO IS INVOLVED AND,
SECONDLY, WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND, THIRDLY,
WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIME WHICH THEY HAVE
COMMITTED.  SO, THERE ARE STILL MANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY BEFORE
GIVING A FINAL OPINION ON THE MATTER.  [END RECORDING]

   [DEL CAMPO] RUBEN ZAMORA HAD A 45-MINUTE MEETING WITH SPANISH
FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.
HE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR AND URGENCY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL
SALVADOR, OF AIDING -- THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL -- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GUERRILLAS.  HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION OF
THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN EL SALVADOR AND THE NEED FOR THE POLITICAL
ARENA TO BE OPENED UP TO PROMOTE THE PEACE PROCESS.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 12 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SOME 150
PEOPLE THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY TODAY TO
PROTEST THE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY OF 12 REFUGEES CLOSELY LINKED TO
FORMER GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.

   RESIDENTS OF A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY
SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN REFUGEES, WHOM THEY
SHOUTED SHOULD BE "SHOT," AND AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR
GRANTING THEM ASYLUM.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS, WHO BROKE THE WINDSHIELDS OF SOME VEHICLES
PASSING IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, WERE FORCED AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF
THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE AND U.S.
SOLDIERS.

   THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ARE
MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, SPOKESMEN OF THE FORMER DEFENSE FORCES;
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY;
NORIEGA'S FORMER SECRETARY, MARCELA TASON; CAPTAIN NARCISA CASTILLERO;
MAJOR HERACLIDES SUCRE; AND SEVEN RELATIVES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
PEOPLE.

      SUCRE WAS CHARGED TODAY BY PANAMANIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO
CRUZ WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI,
WHO PROMOTED A FOILED COUP AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO
PROTECT "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" THE FORMER NORIEGA AIDES WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA.

   PERU ANNOUNCED ON 9 JANUARY THAT IT HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE
PANAMANIAN MILITARY AND SEVEN OF THEIR RELATIVES.  THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT IT WILL NOT GRANT SAFE-CONDUCT FOR
THESE PEOPLE, WHOM IT CONSIDERS "COMMON CRIMINALS," TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON 11 JANUARY SAID THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE
IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND POINTED OUT THAT THE
SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS POSED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REFUGEES SHOULD BE
HANDLED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF PANAMA AND PERU.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMANIAN
PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA IS "UNLAWFUL."  HE ADDED THAT PANAMA IS
BEING RULED BY "THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PENTAGON, THE SOUTHERN
COMMAND, AND THE U.S.  TROOPS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SOURCE,
QUOTING INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR STRICTLY MILITARY GOALS TO INSTEAD
DIRECT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST ECONOMIC TARGETS, WITHIN THEIR USUAL
PATTERN OF WEARING DOWN THE ECONOMY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE IN TACTICS TO THE "FAILURE" OF THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) ON 11 NOVEMBER, IN WHICH SIX GUERRILLA COMMANDERS AND ALL
GUERRILLA TROOPS TOOK PART.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, THE OFFENSIVE'S GOAL WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON A "ONE-TO-ONE" BASIS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE ARMY,
HOWEVER, THE FMLN WAS TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PEOPLE
TO GRAB POWER.

   THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT FOLLOWING
THE OFFENSIVE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO "READAPT" THEIR MILITARY CADRES TO
THE TRADITIONAL "PROLONGED PEOPLE'S WAR."

   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IN TACTICS,
THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO "MAINTAIN THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE AND
THUS RAISE THE FIGHTERS MORALE FOLLOWING THE DISBANDING OF IMPORTANT
MILITARY CADRES."

   FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE
FMLN BETWEEN 23 DECEMBER AND 2 JANUARY, THE GUERRILLAS RESTARTED THEIR
ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY BY BLOWING-UP THE COUNTRY'S
POWER GRID AND SHOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   ECONOMIC LOSSES LAST YEAR DUE TO GUERRILLA SABOTAGE TO THE
TRANSPORT, POWER AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES
SURPASSED $100 MILLION, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE MILITARY RESTRUCTURE ENCOMPASSED THE SIX
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE FMLN: THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF
CENTRAL AMERICAN WORKERS (PRTC), THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE (RN), THE
SALVADORAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCS), THE POPULAR LIBERATION FORCES (FPL),
THE ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION (FAL), AND THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY (ERP).

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PRTC, RN, AND THE PCS NOW
OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY,
WHILE THE FPL OPERATES IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE ERP IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND THE FAL IN THE SOUTHEAST.

ALVAREZ CEDENO] [TEXT] SOME 150 PERSONS PICKETED AND THREW STONES AT
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ON 12 JANUARY.  THE DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED THAT
FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES [FDP] MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, AND
OTHERS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE FORMER MILITARY REGIME WHO SOUGHT REFUGE
AT THE EMBASSY, BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE MISSION.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTED SLOGANS AGAINST NORIEGA AND THREW SOME
STONES.  THEY BROKE THE REAR WINDSHIELDS OF TWO DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY: A WHITE MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES
CD-325, AND A RED MITSUBISHI, LICENSE PLATES CD-142.

   "GRIMALDO...COWARD KILLER, COME OUT AND SHOW YOUR FACE," THE CROWD
SHOUTED WHILE THE U.S. SOLDIERS GUARDING THE MISSION GENTLY MOVED THEM
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET.  SOME EIGHT
MEMBERS OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE, ALSO GUARDING THE EMBASSY,
DID NOT INTERVENE.

   DESPITE THE SHOUTS DEMANDING "JUSTICE AND PRISON" FOR NORIEGA'S
FOLLOWERS, NO ONE CAME OUT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED ON "F" STREET, EL
CANGREJO, A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN PANAMA CITY.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, COMMANDER OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE"
COMPANY THAT FOILED THE 3 OCTOBER COUP AGAINST NORIEGA; HERACLIDES
SUCRE, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS WHO "SHOT"
MOISES GIROLDI; AND MARCELA TASON, NORIEGA'S PERSONAL SECRETARY ARE
ALSO AT THE EMBASSY WITH LOPEZ GRIMALDO, WHO WAS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE
DISMANTLED FDP.

   APPROXIMATELY 40 U.S. SOLDIERS, SUPPORTED BY AN ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIER AND THREE "HUMMER" ARMORED VEHICLES, ARE GUARDING THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY.

   AT THE TIME OF THE DEMOSTRATIONS, RESIDENTS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS
WAVED WHITE HANDERCHIEFS AND BANGED POTS AND PANS, AND EMPTY CANS.  A
SIMILAR SITUATION WAS OCCURRING ON THE STREET.

   ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS TOLD LA PRENSA: "WE WILL STAY HERE UNTIL
THEY COME OUT BECAUSE THEY MUST PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES; WE WILL COME
BACK HERE EVERY AFTERNOON."

   THE U.S. SOLDIERS CORDONED OFF THE AREA WITH CONCERTINA WIRE WHILE
A GROUP OF PEOPLE "BOOED" THEM FOR DOING THIS.

   BOGOTA, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT
MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT AS LONG AS THE
GUERRILLA GROUPS CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE EFFORTS WITH
MILITARY ACTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WILL ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND
MILITARILY.  MINISTER LEMOS WAS REFERRING TO THE CURRENT ATTACKS WHICH HAVE
BEEN LAUNCHED BY SEVERAL REBEL GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  MINISTER
LEMOS SAID THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS WORRIED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC
ORDER, AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO USE THE ARMY AND THE
POLICE TO FIGHT VIOLENCE.

   LIKEWISE, LEMOS SIMMONDS DESCRIBED THE GUERRILLA GROUPS STILL
LAUNCHING ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS ANACHRONIC AND OUT-DATED.
HE SAID THAT WE HOPE THIS SITUATION WILL CHANGE SOON, AND STRESSED
THAT SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EASTERN EUROPE, WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHY MANY OF THE REBEL GROUPS ARE BENT ON IMPOSING A SYSTEM THAT THEY
CONSIDER IDEAL WHEN IT IS BEING REJECTED AND REPUDIATED BY SO MANY
STATES THAT IMPOSED IT.  MINISTER LEMOS SAID THAT THE THE GUERRILLA
ACTION SHOULD BE UP-DATED; THE REBELS SHOULD STOP AND CONSIDER WHETHER
THE STRUGGLE THEY ARE WAGING IS WORTH IT SINCE THE SYSTEM THEY ARE
DEFENDING IS SOMETHING OF THE PAST.

   MINISTER LEMOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS THAT IS
ROCKING THE COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND DEFENSE
MINISTRIES ARE TAKING SPECIAL MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  HE
SAID THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF KIDNAPPING AS A
POLITICAL WEAPON AND ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DEAL WITH ALL
THOSE INVOLVED IN KIDNAPPINGS AS COMMON CRIMINALS.  THE MINISTER ALSO
ASKED THE PEOPLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES IN LOCATING THOSE
AREAS WHERE THE BANDS OF CRIMINALS ARE OPERATING.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER ALSO TALKED ABOUT A DIALOGUE WITH THE
REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, FARC, AND SAID THAT TALKING
ABOUT A DIALOGUE IS USELESS IF THEY CONTINUE THEIR SUBVERSIVE
ACTIVITIES.

DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY, TWO LIEUTENANTS, TWO SECOND
LIEUTENANTS, TWO SUBSERGEANTS, ONE CORPORAL, AND TWO SOLDIERS OF THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES ARE IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI DENOUNCED THE MILITARY MEN ON A RADIO AND
TELEVISION NETWORK.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL
HUMBERTO LARIOS, COLONEL RENE PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF,
AND DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTERS COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA AND COLONEL

   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), NO DATE -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] NOW THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS ADVANCED
TO A SIGNIFICANT POINT, I BELIEVE THE TIME IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE
RESULTS OBTAINED THUS FAR RESPOND TO THE WIDESPREAD OUTCRY OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE - - IN THE SENSE THAT THOSE CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL
ACTIONS STAND TRIAL SO CRIMINALS ARE NOT LEFT UNPUNISHED.  THIS IS THE
COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES.
HOWEVER, IT IS WISE TO CLARIFY THAT, IN THE SAME MANNER THAT PEOPLE
HAVE MADE DEMANDS AND CONDEMNED THE CASE AT ISSUE TODAY, ACTIONS
RESULTING FROM THE WAVE OF FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] TERRORIST VIOLENCE SHOULD ALSO BE CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED WITH
THE SAME VEHEMENCE.

   IN THE SAME MANNER, AGAIN WE WANT TO URGE ALL SALVADORANS TO
ABSTAIN FROM SPECULATING OVER THESE REGRETTABLE INCIDENTS, BECAUSE
THAT WILL ONLY HINDER THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.  IT IS NECESSARY THAT LAW
AND JUSTICE PREVAIL IN OUR COUNTRY, SO THAT NO ONE TRAMPLES ON THEM.

   IN REGARD TO THIS INVESTIGATION, WE WISH TO REAFFIRM THAT AN
OBJECTIVITY HAS PREVAILED AT ALL TIMES, AND THAT THE ACCUSED WILL BE
SENT TO THE PERTINENT COURT SO THAT THEY STAND TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE
MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND IN OTHER LAWS.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE WANT TO TELL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT, ALTHOUGH
IT IS TRUE THIS IS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, WE MUST ACCEPT IT AS AN
UNAVOIDABLE REALITY AND AS EVIDENCE TO THE WORLD THAT WE SALVADORANS
AND OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE A HIGH SENSE OF JUSTICE, MORALITY, AND
ETHICS.

   AS COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL ITS
MEMBERS FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM, DEDICATION, AND EXEMPLARY CONDUCT,
EVIDENCED NOT ONLY IN VIEW OF THIS INCIDENT, BUT ALSO BY HALTING -- IN
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE -- THE FMLN TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  THAT
BRILLIANT HISTORIC EVENT WILL ALWAYS BE PRESENT IN THE HEARTS OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHO WILL RENDER HOMAGE TO THE ARMED FORCES FOR HAVING
PROTECTED THE FREEDOM OF OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

   THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

OSCAR ARIAS TODAY URGED GUATEMALA PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO FOLLOW THE
EXAMPLE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ORDER AN "EXHAUSTIVE
INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR
OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA 2 DAYS AGO.

   ARIAS SAID: "I HOPE PRESIDENT CEREZO WILL DUPLICATE THE ACTIONS
TAKEN BY HIS COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI IN THE CASE OF THE JESUITS
WHO WERE SAVAGELY KILLED 2 MONTHS AGO IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT HARSHLY CRITICIZED "HECTOR OQUELI'S
MURDERERS.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE CRIME," HE SAID.

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IS VERY MOVED BY THE MURDER OF OQUELI,
BECAUSE THEY STUDIED TOGETHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, GREAT
BRITAIN, 22 YEARS AGO, WHEN ARIAS OBTAINED HIS DOCTORATE.

OFFERED FULL GUARANTEES OF DUE PROCESS [GARANTIAS PROCESALES] TO DRUG
TRAFFICKERS WHO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND STOP THEIR TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES AND SMUGGLING OF DRUGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IT WILL
NOT ENTER INTO DEALS WITH THEM THAT MAY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OR
THE LAWS.

   THE STATEMENT, WHICH WAS THE FIRST TO BE MADE BY AN OFFICIAL
SOURCE, WAS MADE BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS TO A TELEVISION
NEWSCAST.

   COMMENTING ON THE COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE EXTRADITABLES OFFER TO
END THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THEY ARE HOLDING, AND
STOP THEIR ATTACKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY
"RESPECT FOR OUR RIGHTS AND RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES,"
LEMOS SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION AND LAWS GUARANTEE A DUE
PROCESS AND RIGHT TO DEFENSE, BUT OF COURSE THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT
THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUBMIT TO THEM SO THAT, THROUGH THE JUDGES
AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEGREE OF
RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR
PUNISHMENT CAN BE DETERMINED."

   HE ADDED: "THESE PERSONS, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WILL ENJOY FULL
LEGAL GUARANTEES, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE
COMPROMISES OF ANY KIND, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT
CANNOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION."

   EXPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THIS WAR ON THE BASIS OF
MAKING NO CONCESSIONS, LEMOS SAID: "I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE
OUR POLICY OF NOT NEGOTIATING WHEN OUR OWN ENEMIES HAVE SAID THAT THIS
POLICY HAS TRIUMPHED."

   IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS DELIVERED THROUGH TWO WOMEN WHO WERE
KIDNAPPED AND RELEASED IN MEDELLIN, SEAT OF THE CARTEL BY THE SAME
NAME, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RECOGNIZED THE STATE'S VICTORY OVER THE
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME OFFERED TO ABIDE BY THE
LAWS.

EXPULSION YESTERDAY BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT.

   DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER JUAN MANUEL CASTULOVICH ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY
THAT SANDIGA HAD BEEN GIVEN 72 HOURS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND
EXPLAINED THAT HIS EXPULSION WAS THE RESULT OF STATEMENTS BY PERUVIAN
AUTHORITIES WHO DENIED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY GUILLERMO ENDARA.

   ENDARA TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE FOLLOWING THE INVASION OF PANAMA BY
U.S. TROOPS WHO TOPPLED GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S REGIME.

   CASTULOVICH DENIED TODAY THAT PANAMA PLANS TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH PERU, AND INSISTED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, WHERE 11
OF NORIEGA'S AIDES HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE, "IS ASSURED OF ALL THE
DIPLOMATIC GUARANTEES."

"WILL NOT ISSUE SAFE-CONDUCTS TO INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED AS COMMON

REVERSE ITS EXTRADITION POLICY BECAUSE EXTRADITIONS ARE A LEGAL TOOL
THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT IN COLOMBIA SINCE 1888.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LEMOS SIMMONDS] I SIGNED THE DECREE THAT
REESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE EXTRADITION PROCEDURES, AND I SIGNED IT
WITH COMPLETE AWARENESS.  I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT NOW FROM
WHAT I SAID 4 OR 5 MONTHS AGO.  [END RECORDING]

   THE MINISTER SAID THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE
DRUG-TRAFFICKERS, BUT ALSO WILL NOT ACT ARROGANTLY IN DEFEATING THEM.
HE ADDED THAT NEW MEASURES AIMED AT STOPPING KIDNAPPINGS IN THE
COUNTRY ARE BEING STUDIED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LEMOS SIMMONDS] OF COURSE NOT ALL THE KIDNAPPED
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED.  LET US HOPE THAT THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS AND
EXTRADITABLES' PROMISE -- THAT NO ONE WILL BE KIDNAPPED AGAIN -- IS
KEPT.  THE TRUTH IS I CANNOT SAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE
KIDNAPPINGS.  [END RECORDING]

RAPE, AND DISAPPEARANCES WERE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE PERUVIAN
GOVERNMENT IN COMBATING VIOLENT OPPOSITION GROUPS LIKE THE "SHINING
PATH" GUERRILLAS. IT SAID MOST OF THE VICTIMS WERE SECONDARY SCHOOL
CHILDREN WHO ARE A MAJOR RECRUITMENT TARGET FOR THE SHINING PATH.

ME?

   [PAZ ZAMORA] YES, I CAN HEAR YOU.  GOOD MORNING, NAPOLEON BRAVO.
IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE TALKING TO YOU TODAY.

   [BRAVO] IT IS ALSO A PLEASURE FOR US.  WE HAVE TEODORO PETKOFF,
LEADER OF MAS HERE IN THE STUDIO.  AS YOU, PRESIDENT GARCIA, AND
TEODORO PETKOFF AGREED, THE TOPIC TO BE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IS LATIN
AMERICA'S FUTURE OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS.  YOU WILL DISCUSS THE
INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION,
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

   THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR PRESIDENT GARCIA.  MR PRESIDENT, IN YOUR
OPINION AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT LATIN AMERICA IS
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN DEBT AND ECONOMIC
STAGNATION, WHAT CAN LATIN AMERICA EXPECT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS?

   [GARCIA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SOCIALISM, I HAVE, HOWEVER, [WORD
INDISTINCT] DIFFICULT REGARDING LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE.  WE CANNOT
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE FOREIGN DEBT [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] EXPLOITATION
OF OUR COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS.  WE CANNOT FORGET THAT OVER
THE PAST 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN EXPORTING CAPITAL AND THAT
[WORDS INDISTINCT] PAID $250 BILLION OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS [WORDS
INDISTINCT], $430,000 AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] $190,000.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] POLITICAL AND MILITARY INTERVENTIONISM [WORDS
INDISTINCT] WHICH THE CASE OF PANAMA CONFIRMS.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]
DEMOCRATIC OR TOTALITARIAN SOCIETIES [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] AND ALL
ENDANGERS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF LATIN AMERICA INSOFAR AS THERE IS NOT
A PROMPT AND VIGOROUS REACTION FROM ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL
LEADERS TO STRENGTHEN OUR PEOPLES' UNITY.  THAT UNITY WILL SERVE AS AN
ANTI-IMPERIALIST INSTRUMENT OF DEFENSE AND AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR OUR CONTINENT OVER THE
NEXT 10 YEARS.  THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL PROTEST OF ALL THE LATIN
AMERICAN MOVEMENTS THAT EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM,
RESPECT FOR LATIN AMERICAN FREEDOM, AND ESPECIALLY RESPECT FOR LATIN
AMERICAN UNITY.

   [BRAVO] THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT.  PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA, I AM GOING
TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION.  IN YOUR OPINION, AND TAKING INTO
ACCOUNT THE INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, POPULATION
EXPLOSION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, THE CURRENT LATIN AMERICAN
ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, ABOUT WHICH IN FACT I
THINK I HEARD -- AND I SAY I THINK, BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EARLY IN THE
MORNING -- OVER THE ECO LATIN AMERICAN TELEVISION NETWORK THIS MORNING
THAT YOU ARE SOLVING THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, WHAT IS LATIN AMERICA'S
FUTURE FOR THE LAST DECADE OF THIS CENTURY?

   [PAZ] MY FRIEND NAPOLEON BRAVO, I HAVE A FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC
VIEWPOINT WITH REGARD TO LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE FOR THIS LAST DECADE
OF THE CENTURY.  I BELIEVE WE MUST ADMIT THAT DESPITE ALL THE
DIFFICULTIES, THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, THE MISERY THAT EXISTS ON OUR
CONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, AND OTHER PROBLEMS, SINCE THE
LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS WERE FORMED, OUR CONTINENT HAS NEVER BEEN
BETTER THAN TODAY.  IN OTHER WORDS, SINCE THE LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS
WERE FORMED, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ALMOST 90 PERCENT OF THE CONTINENT
LIVING WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AS WE DO NOW.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE
PERSPECTIVES WE HAD TODAY.  I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MY
COUNTRY, OF LATIN AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY OF OUR THREE COUNTRIES.

   I AM SO OPTIMISTIC THAT I EVEN WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT
TOUCHES OUR SOULS.  WE WILL BEGIN THE DECADE BY WINNING THE WORLD
SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP IN ITALY.  WE MUST NOT UNDERESTIMATE SOCCER,
BECAUSE SOCCER IS CULTURE, TOO, AND REPRESENTS OUR PEOPLES' STRENGTH.

   TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT MINE IS AN OPTIMISTIC POINT OF VIEW, I
WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS, LATIN AMERICA WILL
FACE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.  ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL BE TO FIND A
WAY TO REJOIN AN ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND COMMERCIAL WORLD FROM WHICH

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM, THE COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT ADVISES THE COLOMBIA PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRM, COHERENT, AND EFFICIENT POLICY TO ENFORCE
THE LAW HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WITH REGARD TO THE CONTROL OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THAT POLICY HAS CREATED A NEW
SITUATION, WHICH HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT TO COMPLETE THE DISMANTLING OF
GROUPS OF MURDERERS AND NARCO-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.

WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL THEIR DUTY OF ENFORCING THE LAW AND BRINGING
CRIMINALS BEFORE JUSTICE ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL
PROCEDURES AND THE OPTIONS OFFERED BY THE LAW.

   4. THE STATEMENTS BY FOUR FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTS, BY THE
CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP OF COLOMBIA, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE
PATRIOTIC UNION ARE PATRIOTIC ACTIONS INTENDED TO SPARE COLOMBIANS
MORE SUFFERING AND PAIN.  THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY APPRECIATES THE
MEANING OF THOSE STATEMENTS.  THOSE STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE THREE
COLOMBIAN PARTIES AND THE CHURCH. [SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   5. THE COUNTRY HAS ACTED WITH CALM, CAUTION, REALISM, AND
RESPONSIBILITY.  THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE DID NOT LET THEMSELVES BE
CARRIED AWAY BY RECKLESS EXPECTATIONS.  THE COUNTRY MUST MAINTAIN THAT
ATTITUDE.

   6. AUTHORIZED MEDIA SPOKESMEN HAVE MENTIONED THE MANY QUESTIONS
THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES CONCERNING THAT SITUATION,
WHICH ONLY THE FUTURE CAN CONVINCINGLY CLARIFY.

   7. THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE COMPLETE END TO CRIMES, MURDERS, AND
ATTACKS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS, NEWSMEN, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.  THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED AND THE DEFINITIVE SUSPENSION OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AND THE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES COURAGEOUSLY
MADE BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE SEEK THOSE OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER
THINGS.

   8. NOW THAT THE STATE'S VICTORY AND THE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE
COUNTRY'S LAW ARE ADMITTED, WE MUST WALK ALONG THE BEST PATH TO ENSURE
THE FINAL SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY, WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED
BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [ARTICLE] [MARISOL MARIN] [TEXT]
SALVADORAN COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS WITH A PEREMPTORY SENTENCE: "EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE; IT IS
EITHER US OR THEM.  THESE HAVE BEEN THE INTELLECTUALS WHO HAVE BEEN GUIDING
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS FOR A LONG TIME."

   THIS IS STATED IN A RESOLUTION ISSUED THIS MORNING BY JUDGE RICARDO
ZAMORA WHO ORDERED A PROVISIONAL ARREST WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRIAL OF
THE EIGHT MILITARY OFFICERS IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME AND THE ARREST OF
A THIRD ONE WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE SINCE DECEMBER.

   TWO LIEUTENANTS AND A SECOND LIEUTENANT HAVE ACCUSED BENAVIDES IN
THEIR DEPOSITIONS AS THE PERSON WHO "GAVE THE ORDER" ON THE EVENING 15
NOVEMBER AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL HE DIRECTED AND WHICH WAS IN CHARGE OF
CONTROLLING THE SECTOR WHERE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA) IS
LOCATED.

   "WE WILL START WITH THE LEADERS.  THE UNIVERSITY IS IN OUR SECTOR
AND ELLACURIA IS THERE.  HE MUST BE ELIMINATED AND I WANT NO
WITNESSES," BENAVIDES SAID TO LIEUTENANT YUSSAY RENE MENDOZA
VALLECILLOS, ACCORDING TO THE LATTER'S TESTIMONY.

   A FEW HOURS LATER, EARLY IN THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, JESUIT
PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF THE UCA; IGNACIO MARTIN BARO,
JUAN RAMON MORENO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, SEGUNDO MONTES (SPANIARDS),
AND AMANDO LOPEZ (SALVADORAN), AS WELL AS THEIR COOK, ELBA JULIA
RAMOS, AND HER DAUGHTER, CELINA MARICET RAMOS, WERE ASSASSINATED.

   IT ALL HAPPENED DURING THE CURFEW AND 5 DAYS AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLA GROUPS HAD LAUNCHED
THEIR LARGEST OFFENSIVE.

   BENAVIDES GAVE THE ORDER TO LIEUTENANT MENDOZA, LIEUTENANT
ESPINOZA, AND SECOND LIEUTENANT GUEVARA CERRITOS, OFFICERS OF THE
ATLACATL BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TRAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH
HAD BEEN SENT TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL.

   THE SOLDIERS WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NECESSARY "TO ELIMINATE THE
GUERRILLA GROUPS' INTELLECTUAL LEADERS AND THAT THEY WERE AT THE UCA,"
ACCORDING TO CORPORAL ANGEL PEREZ VASQUEZ' DEPOSITION.

   THEY WERE ALSO TOLD THAT "THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT SOME INJURED
TERRORIST CRIMINALS WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE UCA" AND THEY WERE
INSISTENTLY TOLD THAT "ALL THE PEOPLE THERE WERE TERRORISTS."

   ACCORDING TO SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS' VERSION,
THE MISSION MUST BE SECRETLY CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIND
SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL AND OTHER KINDS OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE USED,
SUCH AS MEDICINE, BOOTS, AND CLOTHES.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY OFFICERS' DEPOSITIONS GATHERED IN THE
JUDGE'S RESOLUTION, A FLARE WOULD BE FIRED WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO
WITHDRAW, TO INDICATE THERE HAD BEEN A CLASH.

   SECOND SERGEANT ANTONIO RAMIRO AVALOS VARGAS SAYS THAT FIVE OF THE
SIX JESUITS WERE TAKEN OUT TO THE GARDEN AND ORDERED TO LIE FACE DOWN,
THEN LIEUTENANT ESPINOZA ORDERED HIM AND PRIVATE MARIANO AMAYA
GRIMALDI TO PROCEED.

   THE THREE OFFICERS ADMITTED THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, BUT NOT
ABOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME.  THE FOUR SOLDIERS ADMITTED
THEIR ROLE AS EXECUTIONERS, OUT OF LOYALTY TO THEIR SUPERIORS AND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED TRAITORS.

   THE JUDGE SAID THERE ARE "ENOUGH ELEMENTS" TO ESTABLISH THE
PARTICIPATION OF COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES IN THESE ACTIONS,
INCLUDING, FIRST OF ALL, THE DEPOSITION SIGNED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

   PONCE SAID HE ORDERED THE CREATION OF A SECURITY COMMANDO, WITH
HEADQUARTERS IN THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND UNDER COLONEL GUILLERMO
ALFREDO BENAVIDES' COMMAND, TO DEFEND THE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
LOCATED IN THE ZONE WHICH MIGHT BECOME THE TARGETS OF "A TERRORIST
AGGRESSION."  THE UCA IS ALSO LOCATED IN THE ZONE.

   THE JUDICIAL RESOLUTION INCLUDES THE DEPOSITIONS GIVEN BY ALL THE
PRISONERS TO THE POLICE, EXCEPT COL BENAVIDES, WHO MET WITH JUDGE
RICARDO ZAMORA FOR OVER 2 HOURS.

   THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WHICH LATER SENT THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS TO AN ARMY HONOR
COMMISSION THAT WILL COOPERATE IN DETERMING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 23 JAN 90 (TASS INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FROM THE
SOVIET POINT OF VIEW, THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES OF WEAPONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TAKES ON, IN PRESENT CONDITIONS, A PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY AT A BRIEFING BY GENNADIY GERASIMOV,
HEAD OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, WHO
REPORTED THE DEBATES OPENING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON GIVING U.S.  MILITARY
AID TO THAT COUNTRY.

   IN RECENT TIMES, THE USSR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN NOTED, CERTAIN
ADVANCES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE MATTER OF RENEWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE OPPOSING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE OPPONENTS OF NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION IN THAT COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT A CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AND ARE COUNTING ON THE
CONTINUATION OF BLOODSHED.  THE EL SALVADOR PRESIDENT ALFONSO CRISTIAN
CONFIRMED THE INVOLVEMENT OF TROOPS IN THE MURDER OF PRIESTS.  A NEW
VICTIM OF THE TERROR IS HECTOR OQUELI, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRIES OF
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN BASIN AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT PARTY, SAID GENNADIY GERASIMOV.

   THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT,
THE SOVIET DIPLOMAT NOTED, HAS STATED ITS DECISION TO STOP CONDUCTING
FURTHER COMBAT OPERATIONS IF THE UNITED STATES HALTS ITS MILITARY AID
TO THE RULING REGIME.

   IN THESE CONDITIONS, GERASIMOV STRESSED, THE CONTINUATION OF ARMS
SUPPLIES TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN FACT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE
WHO BLATANTLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOES NOT PROMOTE THE
STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITIONS OF THOSE WHO CHAMPION DIALOGUE AND
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN EL SALVADOR.  "ALL OF THAT MAY BECOME A
SERIOUS OBSTACLE IN THE WAY TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THAT
COUNTRY AND CENTRAL AMERICA IN GENERAL", HE SAID.

DENIED THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL IS DIVIDED AND STRESSED THAT THOSE WHO TOLD
ON GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA WERE CALI CARTEL MEMBERS.  FOR SEVERAL MONTHS,
ESCOBAR'S GROUP HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH WITH THE MEMBERS OF

   ESCOBAR'S COMMUNIQUE EVEN GIVES THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO
COLLECTED THE REWARD FROM THE AUTHORITIES, A REWARD THAT HAD BEEN
ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION AS A PRIZE FOR DENOUNCING EL MEJICANO
[RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S ALIAS].

   HERE IS MORE ON THIS COMMUNIQUE:

   IN A NEW EXCHANGE OF COMMUNIQUES, A PRACTICE THAT HAS BECOME COMMON
NOWADAYS, ESCOBAR DECIDED TO WRITE A LETTER TO SANTOS TO CLARIFY
CERTAIN DOUBTS: FIRST, TO SAY THAT HIS FRIENDS AND COLLABORATORS HAVE
NOT WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF A CAMPAIGN CARRIED OUT BY
THE 4TH BRIDAGE IN ANTIOQUIA, AS REPORTED IN EL TIEMPO.  ESCOBAR
STRESSED THAT THE BEST PROOF THAT HIS FRIENDS HAVE NOT BETRAYED OR
ABANDONED HIM IS THAT HE IS STILL FREE.  SECOND, HE SAID THAT IF THE
GOVERNMENT EVER DECIDES TO FIGHT FOR PEACE, IT WILL FIND A LONG,
ENDLESS LIST OF EXTRADITABLES, DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HENCHMEN, AND
PARAMILITARY GROUP MEMBERS WHO WANT TO ACCOMPANY THE GOVERNMENT IN
THAT PROCESS.  THIRD, HE ACCUSED JORGE VELAZQUEZ, A MEMBER OF THE CALI
CARTEL WHOSE ALIAS IS "THE NAVIGATOR," OF DENOUNCING RODRIGUEZ GACHA
AND COLLECTING THE REWARD.  HE ALSO ACCUSED CALI CARTEL MEMBERS OF
DENOUNCING JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN PALMIRA AND OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISAPPEARANCE AND MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA PEOPLE WHO VISITED VALLE DEL
CAUCA DEPARTMENT.  ESCOBAR ALSO CHARGED THAT CALI CARTEL MEMBERS
PLACED 700 KG OF DYNAMITE IN HIS FAMILY'S BUILDING.  FOURTH, HE NOTED
THAT HIS STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE CALI CARTEL NOT THE VALLE DEL CAUCA
PEOPLE AND ADDED: I FEEL GREAT ADMIRATION AND PROFOUND RESPECT FOR
VALLE PEOPLE BECAUSE MY WIFE, VICTORIA, WAS BORN IN THAT BEAUTIFUL
LAND, HER ANCESTORS ALL LIVED THERE.  CONCLUDING HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH
HE HAS NEVER ACCEPTED THE CALI CARTEL'S PEACE PROPOSAL, HE HAS NEVER
REJECTED DIALOGUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR SOLUTIONS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 24 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO
PONCE, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, TODAY DISCLOSED AN
ALLEGED PLAN ACCORDING TO WHICH THE GUERRILLAS WILL ATTEMPT TO ATTACK
MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR "TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT INTO
NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION" TO THE ARMED CONFLICT.

   CITING MILITARY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS, PONCE ANTICIPATED THAT "AS OF
NEXT WEEKEND, UNTIL 10 FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS WILL CARRY OUT
TERRORIST ACTIONS AND ATTACKS ON MILITARY UNITS, PRIMARILY IN THE
METROPOLITAN AREA, IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
IN A PROPAGANDISTIC MANNER."

   "THEY ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SO THAT
IT, IN TURN, WILL MOVE TOWARD NEGOTIATING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE
ARMED CONFLICT," PONCE SAID DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE GENERAL
STAFF'S HEADQUARTERS.

   THE EXECUTION OF THE ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) PLAN WILL COINCIDE WITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S SCHEDULED TRIP TO THE UNITED NATIONS AT THE END OF THE
MONTH.

   CRISTIANI WILL MEET ON 31 JANUARY WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER
PEREZ DE CUELLAR, TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES IN FAVOR OF RESUMING THE
DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS, WHICH WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER.

   FOLLOWING NOVEMBER'S GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN
HAVE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE, WITH UNITED
NATIONS PARTICIPATION.

   PONCE POINTED OUT THAT THE "SPECIFIC AREAS" THE GUERRILLAS WILL
ATTEMPT TO ATTACK ARE SOME OF THE MILITARY POSITIONS AT THE EL ESPINO
FARM IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AYUTUXTEPEQUE IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ZARAGOZA AND HUIZUCAR IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF SAN SALVADOR, AND SOYAPANGO IN THE EAST.

   THESE AREAS ARE AMONG THE LEADING SITES OF THE BLOODIEST CLASHES
BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS DURING THE REBELS' HARSHEST OFFENSIVE
11 NOVEMBER.

   THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND REBELS WAS
SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER FOLLOWING A DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST A LABOR UNION
HEADQUARTERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS WERE KILLED AND 30 OTHERS WOUNDED.

   PRIOR TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE, THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN
HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS IN MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BUT FAILED TO REACH
AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE COUNTRY'S ARMED CONFLICT.

   BOGOTA, 17 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES BY THE
U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (DEA), THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED
BY THE COCAINE CULTIVATED AND PRODUCED BY PERUVIAN, BOLIVIAN, AND
COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHEN IT IS PEDDLED ON THE STREETS OF THE
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS $140 BILLION ANNUALLY.

   ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS, COCAINE TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA MAY TOTAL
$100 MILLION IF RETAIL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ARE TAKEN
INTO ACCOUNT.

   THIS ILLEGAL TRADE, WHICH AMOUNTS TO 10 PERCENT OF THE WORLD ARMS
TRADE VOLUME, MAY COME TO AN END IF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS
THE PEACE OFFER FROM "THE EXTRADITABLES," ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL.

   OF THE $140 MILLION, THE TAKE OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS ON
A WHOLESALE BASIS IS ONLY $7.13 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO A STUDY
MADE BY CARLOS CABALLERO ARGAEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN BANKING
ASSOCIATION.

   ACCORDING TO CABALLERO, WHEN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, INPUT,
TRANSPORTATION, SECURITY, AND CONFISCATIONS IS DEDUCTED, THE NET
ANNUAL EARNINGS OF THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS TOTAL $4.060
BILLION.

   CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT THE COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS EXPORT A TOTAL OF
310 TONS PER YEAR, OF WHICH 270 TONS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AT
AN AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE OF $19,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND 40 TONS IN
EUROPE AT $50,000 PER KILOGRAM.

   THE EXPERT TOLD EFE THAT THE NETWORKS OF PEDDLERS SELL THE COCAINE
AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $200,000 PER KILOGRAM, AND THEREFORE THEIR
GROSS TAKE MAY BE $62 BILLION PER YEAR.

   IF THE EXTRA PROFITS RESULTING FROM DILUTING THE POWDER BY MIXING
IT WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES IS ADDED TO THIS AMOUNT, THEIR GROSS EARNINGS
MAY AMOUNT TO $100 BILLION PER YEAR.

   THE DEA'S ESTIMATE OF $140 BILLION IS REACHED BY ADDING TO THE $100
BILLION THAT THE COLOMBIAN COCAINE FINALLY GENERATES ABOUT $40 BILLION
GENERATED BY PERUVIAN AND COLOMBIAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.

   CABALLERO ASSERTS THAT COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS INVEST
APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF $4.060 BILLION IN
COLOMBIA.

   ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN FEDERATION OF REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND UN
CONSULTANTS, THIS MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED IN 1 MILLION HECTARES OF
FARMLAND AND RANGES, BUILDINGS, INDUSTRIES, AND TOURISM BUSINESSES.

   THE $1 BILLION THE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVESTED
ANNUALLY IN COLOMBIA DURING THE 1980'S REPRESENTS 2.8 PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY'S $35 BILLION GNP.

   ACCORDING TO THE DEA, THE 270 TONS OF COCAINE THAT ARRIVE IN THE
UNITED STATES FROM COLOMBIA REPRESENT 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE
CONSUMED IN THAT COUNTRY.

   DEA SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CALI CARTEL, THE OTHER COLOMBIAN
MAFIA ORGANIZATION AND SECOND LARGEST AFTER THE MEDELLIN CARTEL,
CONTROLS THE WHOLESALE MARKET IN NEW YORK AND PART OF THAT IN LOS
ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO.

   THE STRUGGLE FOR THOSE MARKETS RESULTED LAST YEAR IN WHAT THE
POLICE DUBBED THE "WAR AMONG THE CARTELS," AND IN THE KILLING OF 100
MEMBERS FROM BOTH ORGANIZATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
3,000 PERSONS DIE FROM DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR,
WHILE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO CAUSE 520,000 DEATHS PER YEAR THERE.

MAIN OIL PIPELINE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSING MORE THAN 15,000 BARRELS OF OIL
TO SPILL AND REACH THE CATATUMBO RIVER ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.

   REPORTS IN BOGOTA POINT OUT THAT THE OIL SPILL, WHICH IS
APPROXIMATELY 3 KM LONG, IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE CATATUMBO RIVER,
THREATENING TO REACH VENEZUELA'S MARACAIBO LAKE WITHIN HOURS.

BORGE.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM EL SALVADOR,
YOU SAID THAT YOU HOPED FOR AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN REBELS
AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT.  YOU, LIKE ALL CENTRAL
AMERICANS, WANT PEACE, BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO
THE FACT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED RELIABLE PROOF
OF MILITARY AID [FROM NICARAGUA] TO THE LEFTIST SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS,
AND RECENTLY, AN ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER SAID THAT
NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A SUBVERSIVE GROUP KNOWN AS THE
CINCHONEROS OF HONDURAS?

   [BORGE] AS FOR THE STATEMENT THAT NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A
HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, I WISH TO SAY THAT THE STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY
FALSE, BUT A SERIOUS CHARGE.  I INVITE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME TO
NICARAGUA, INCLUDING THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, TO DO SO.  WE WILL GIVE
THEM ABSOLUTE FREEDOM TO SHOW WHERE THE CINCHONEROS CAMPS ARE LOCATED,
WHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED OR THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE BEING
CARRIED OUT.  IF THIS EXISTS, IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN.  IT IS VERY
DIFFICULT TO HIDE A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP.  I ASSURE THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WITH A HIGH SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY, THAT NICARAGUA WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR
GUERRILLA GROUPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH CAMPS IN NICARAGUA,
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS HONDURAS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS?

   [BORGE] MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT EL SALVADOR.  IT IS SAID
THAT WE SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN REVOLUTIONARIES.  THIS CHARGE
HAS BEEN MADE FOR MANY YEARS.  I COULD SAY THAT THE AIRPLANE THAT WE
DOWNED IN NICARAGUA, FLOWN BY THE FAMOUS HASENFUS, CAME FROM EL
SALVADOR, BUT WHY BRING THAT UP?  THE FACT IS THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE
WORLD A POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, KNOWN AS THE CIA, WHICH HAS
ENORMOUS TECHNICAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES THAT CAN ENABLE IT TO
ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHAT IS HAPPENING ANYWHERE, AND YET IT HAS NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NICARAGUA IS PROVIDING WEAPONS TO ANY
ARMED MOVEMENT ANYWHERE.  THEREFORE, LET US PUT THAT INTO THE SAME
CONTEXT AS THE STATEMENT THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH CUBA ARE COOLING.  WE
COULD ALSO POINT OUT OTHER LIES TOLD ABOUT US.  WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED
OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS.  WE HAVE BEEN CALLED DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE ARE
ACCUSED OF BURNING DOWN A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA.
INCIDENTALLY, LET ME TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JEWISH
SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA, YET THIS WAS SAID BY NO LESS THAN U.S.
PRESIDENT REAGAN.

   THUS, THEY TELL ALL THOSE LIES ABOUT NICARAGUA AND THAT IS ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT THEY SAY, JUST AS THEY SAY THAT WE ARE THE ENEMIES OF
HUMAN RIGHTS, THAT WE PERSECUTE CLERGYMEN.  NOTE THAT IN NICARAGUA NO
PRIEST HAS EVER BEEN IMPRISONED, MURDERED, OR EXILED, EXCEPT ON ONE
OCCASION BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.  IN NICARAGUA, WE HAVE
MADE CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORTS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE MAIN
ACCUSATION LEVELED AGAINST OUR COUNTRY IS FAILURE TO RESPECT HUMAN
RIGHTS.

   WE ARE ACCUSED OF PLANNING ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THERE WAS A POLL DONE
BY A U.S. FIRM THAT GIVES THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FSLN]...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS
NOT A SANDINIST COMPANY; IT MIGHT HAVE VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR
SANDINISM, BUT IT IS APPARENTLY A RELIABLE COMPANY.  IT GIVES THE FSLN
A MAJORITY OF 51 PERCENT, AND THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION [UNO] --
ONE OF THE POLITICAL FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTORAL CONTEST --
24 PERCENT.

   OTHER POLLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAVE GIVEN THE FSLN CLOSE TO 69
PERCENT, AS OPPOSED TO UNO, TO WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED 27 PERCENT.  YET,
WHAT IS BEING SAID?  THAT THERE WILL BE ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THEREFORE,
THAT CHARGE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, LIKE THIS ONE WHICH
GREATLY BOTHERS ME, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE ARE HARBORING SUBVERSIVE
GROUPS FOR THEM TO COME TO HONDURAS... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I CAN
GUARANTEE TO THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO THE NEW HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT THAT IN NICARAGUA WE WILL NOT TAKE A SINGLE STEP IN THAT
DIRECTION.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [BORGE] ON PANAMA, I DO NOT NEED TO SAY ANYTHING.  THE FACTS SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1070 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 JAN 90 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO LOPEZ HAS SAID THAT "THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REPEAT A TERRORIST ATTACK
LIKE THE ONE LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE LOGISTICAL
OR OTHER NECESSARY SUPPORT AT THIS TIME, NOR WILL IT HAVE SUCH SUPPORT IN
THE MONTHS TO COME."

   MERINO SAID THAT THE FMLN REPEATS ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN
CYCLES THAT MUST BE BROKEN TO PREVENT FURTHER SUFFERING AND BLOODSHED.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LOST
GROUND IN EVERY WAY AND THE DIALOGUE MUST BE RESUMED AS THE ONLY WAY
TO ACHIEVE A FIRM AND LASTING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS NEVER BEEN NAIVE REGARDING THE
FMLN'S LACK OF SINCERITY DURING THE DIALOGUE, BUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO
SEEK PEACE THROUGH REASON, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE AWARE OF THE FMLN'S
WARLIKE ATTITUDE," MERINO SAID.

   REGARDING THE FMLN'S DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING TO BE
HELD BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF
THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK, MERINO SAID THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT HOPE
TO BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR.

   "THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO NEW YORK TO EXPRESS, ONCE AGAIN, THE
SINCERITY WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH
DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN'S HOPE OF HAVING A TETE-A-TETE WITH THE PRESIDENT
AT THE UNITED NATIONS IS TOTALLY ABSURD," THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID.

   MERINO SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA'S ONLY WAY OUT IS TO GIVE UP THE
ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC LIFE, ALTHOUGH HE
CONCEDED THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE DIFFICULT AND THAT IT WILL NATURALLY
HAVE TO BE GRADUAL IN ORDER FOR THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS TO FEEL SAFE
"WITHOUT HAVING A WEAPON AT THE READY."

   ON THE OTHER HAND, IN REFERENCE TO THE CASE OF THE JESUITS, IN
WHICH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED, MERINO ADVISED
CAUTION REGARDING STATEMENTS THAT VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY MIGHT
MAKE.

   "PRUDENCE IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TRUTH," MERINO SAID.
HE POINTED OUT THAT THE ADVANCES MADE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE
PROVE THE DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  


DEV-MUC3-1071 (TRW)

   CLANDESTINE, 28 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, LIFETIME PRESIDENT OF ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], HAS SAID THAT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER ARRESTS
OR DETENTIONS OF SOLDIERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE JESUIT MURDER CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT'S STRONGMAN HAS SAID IT IS OVER, PERIOD.
D'AUBUISSON INSISTS THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN
THE JESUIT CASE, ACCORDING TO A HEADLINE IN TODAY'S LA PRENSA GRAFICA,
IN WHICH IT PUBLISHES D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS.

   WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WILL SUMMON D'AUBUISSON
TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS LED HIM TO ASSERT CATEGORICALLY THAT
NO OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
PRIESTS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE SO, BECAUSE THAT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HAS
NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED TO SUMMON OR TO INQUIRE, NOT EVEN TO SUMMON THE
MAIN SUSPECT IN THE MURDERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN BLAMED ON THE DEATH
SQUADS.  ONE OF THEM IS FORMER PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO
ACCUSED HIM OF BEING THE MASTERMIND OF MSGR ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION.
YET, D'AUBUISSON GOES ON COMPLETELY UNSCATHED.

   THEREFORE, ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON TODAY PLACED A FINAL PERIOD ON THE
INVESTIGATION OF COLONEL [GUILLERMO] BENAVIDES.  OBVIOUSLY,
MAJOR D'AUBUISSON, THE ARENA STRONGMAN, IS PLACING A FINAL PERIOD ON
THE CASE, AND HE IS TELLING THIS DIRECTLY AND PUBLICLY TO CRISTIANI,
THE YANKEES, AND THE REST OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966
GRADUATING CLASS OF CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].

   IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ARENA MEMBERS TO TELL CRISTIANI HOW FAR TO GO
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  THEY NEVER APPROVED OF HAVING EVEN THE
LIEUTENANTS OF THE ATLACATL BATTALION INVESTIGATED.  THE HEATED
ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE ARENA LEADERSHIP HAVE DESTABILIZED THE GOVERNMENT
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT MERINO'S SUDDEN FALL IS BUT THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG AND D'AUBUISSON'S SIGNAL TO STOP A SHOW OF FORCE.  D'AUBUISSON
BELIEVES THAT SERVING UP BENAVIDES' HEAD IS MORE THAN ENOUGH, AND THIS
IS THE FRANK MESSAGE THAT ARENA AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SENDING TO THE
U.S.  CONGRESS, PRECISELY AT THE TIME THE YANKEE POLICY ON EL SALVADOR
IS UNDER SERIOUS SCRUTINY.

   THE STRONGMAN IS TELLING LA TANDONA: DO NOT WORRY ANY MORE.  WE HAD
TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THE CONGRESS, BUT CRISTIANI'S MODERATION WILL GO
JUST SO FAR.  D'AUBUISSON CONTINUES TO BE THE STRONGMAN.  


DEV-MUC3-1072 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] TODAY, 2 DAYS
BEFORE HIS MEETING WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR,
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REAFFIRMED HIS WILLINGNESS TO HOLD TALKS WITH
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  HOWEVER, CRISTIANI
SAID, THE FLMN IS SENDING CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS ON ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA, CORRESPONDENT] A FEW HOURS
BEFORE DEPARTING ON HIS TRIP TO WASHINGTON TODAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC REITERATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE WITH THE
FMLN, WHICH, HE SAID, IS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR HIS VISIT TO THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [CRISTIANI] THE MAIN GOAL IS TO HOLD A WORK SESSION WITH THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.  THIS WILL BE ON 31 JANUARY.  THE GOAL IS TO SEARCH
FOR AND COME UP WITH ANY MECHANISMS THAT COULD EASE THE RESUMPTION OF
THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, SO ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS CEASE AND SO WE CAN
SEARCH FOR AN AGREEMENT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF THE FMLN THROUGH
POLITICAL MEANS.  THEN WE WILL HOLD A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH ON 1
FEBRUARY IN WASHINGTON.  WE WILL ALSO VISIT OTHER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.

   [GUEVARA] THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, WHO JUST RETURNED FROM HONDURAS
WHERE HE MET U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY THAT HE HAS RECEIVED OFFERS FROM THE
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE IN VENEZUELA.

   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE DETERMINED TO SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT THROUGH DIALOGUE.  THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL DISCUSS
WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE CUELLAR -- SEARCHING FOR ELEMENTS
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS POSSIBLE.  REGARDING THE FMLN, WE SEE SOME
CONTRADICTORY INDICATIONS AT THIS TIME.  IN SOME COMMUNIQUES, THE FMLN
IS SOMEHOW EXPRESSING THE DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE DIALOGUE PROCESS,
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE FMLN CONTINUES
TRYING TO PLAN SOME ATTACKS ON SAN SALVADOR, IN ADDITION TO OTHER
TERRORIST ACTIONS AIMED AT THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE BELIEVE
THIS IS CONTRADICTORY.  HOWEVER, I MYSELF BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME
POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT WILL PERMIT RESUMING A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT
COULD BRING SOME BENEFITS.

   [GUEVARA] ASKED ABOUT REPORTS BY THE SAN SALVADOR AUXILIARY BISHOP
REGARDING SEARCHES AT SOME CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICES, CRISTIANI SAID
THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT, BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FOR
SECURITY REASONS.

   [CRISTIANI] AS PART OF THE THINGS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AT
THIS TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME REPORTS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY WRONG.
HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT ALL AS A SIGN OF
SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FOR SECURITY
REASONS, BASED ON REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, WE MUST TAKE
ACTION, AND IF THERE IS NOTHING...[CHANGES THOUGHT].  THOSE
WHO HAVE NO PROBLEM AND HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL MATTERS
SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

   [GUEVARA] THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS PLEASED WITH THE
STATEMENTS BY NEW HONDURAN PRESIDENT RAFAEL CALLEJAS, WHO EXPRESSED
HIS TOTAL SUPPORT FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PLAN.  CONCERNING AN
UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT NO DATE HAS
BEEN SET YET AND HE BELIEVES THIS CANNOT BE DONE BEFORE THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTIONS.  [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1073 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] COLONEL
MAURICIO ERNESTO VARGAS TODAY HAS SAID THERE IS NO NEED OR REASON FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO SUSPEND AID TO THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, SHOULD WE GET TO THAT
POINT, THE ARMED FORCES ARE READY TO CONTINUE DEFENDING THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALFREDO VILLARREAL, CORRESPONDENT] COL VARGAS
BELIEVES THE U.S. AID IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE
PROVIDED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID IT IS
NOT POSSIBLE THAT A MINORITY, AS HE TERMED THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL AFFECT, WITH ITS
DISINFORMATION METHODS AIMED AT COUNTRIES ABROAD, U.S. MILITARY AID
BEING CUT OFF OR DECREASED.  HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT IF THE AID IS SUSPENDED, THIS WOULD COMPLICATE THE ARMED FORCES
PLANS CONCERNING THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.

   [COL VARGAS] I CERTAINLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE, HAVING A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HAVE SO LITTLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE TRUTH.  IT
CAN TAKE 100 DAYS TO SPREAD A LIE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH IN 1
DAY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT....[CHANGES THOUGHT] I
BELIEVE WE ARE OVERESTIMATING THE LEFT-WING ACTIONS.  WE VIEW THEM AS
BEING SMART, AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLS.  ANY CUT OR SUSPENSION IN
THE AID WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE FURTHER NEEDS
WHENEVER WE NEED TO FULFILL A MISSION.  THEREFORE, MISSIONS WILL BE A
BIT MORE COMPLICATED, BUT WE WILL FULFILL THEM.  IF MARXISTS --
THROUGH THEIR CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION -- BELIEVE THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO
HARM THE UNITED STATES-EL SALVADOR ALLIANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AND
THAT THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.  THEY
WILL FIND AN ARMED FORCES WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO
DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] COL VARGAS, IN CHARGE OF THE 3D MILITARY
ZONE IN SAN MIGUEL, SAID HE AGREES WITH THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE THE
EIGHT MILITARY MEN, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL AND TWO LIEUTENANTS, CHARGED
WITH KILLING SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  COL VARGAS SAID THOSE WHO HAVE
BROKEN THE LAW MUST PAY FOR IT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

   [COL VARGAS] THE ARMY WILL FEEL PAIN IN THE EVENT ANY OF ITS
MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT RULE
THE ARMED FORCES.  THIS IS VERY PAINFUL.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BUILDING
A DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE FACTS THAT MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE
NORMS PREVAILING IN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE.
DEMOCRACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAN INSTITUTIONS IN
INDIVIDUAL TERMS, AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF
PEOPLE OR GROUPS, WHICH CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] IN THE MILITARY ASPECT, COL VARGAS SAID
THAT AS OF 1990, IN HIS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING
THE PLANS DRAFTED BY THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF KNOWN AS "VICTORY AND
HAMMER" WHICH HAS OFFERED, AS PRELIMINARY RESULTS, 53 CLASHES, 37
GUERRILLAS AND 12 SOLDIERS KILLED, AND WEAPONS SEIZURES.  THE TWO
OPERATIONS, HE ADDED, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1074 (TRW)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THE POLICE IN WASHINGTON ARRESTED THE LEADERS OF A GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS
WHO HAD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL TO DEMAND THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY
AID TO EL SALVADOR.  A FEW HOURS LATER, REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL CHURCHES
ASSERTED THAT A PERSECUTION HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAINST
"RELIGIOUS PEOPLE" AND THAT THE AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THAT REASON.
THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION WAS THAT, BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE AID, OUR
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TERRORISTS.

   THIS CAMPAIGN DATES BACK A LONG TIME.  IT BEGAN WITH THE ARRIVAL IN
EL SALVADOR OF SEVERAL JESUIT PRIESTS FROM LOVAINA UNIVERSITY IN THE
EARLY 1960'S AND CONTINUED WITH THE FOUNDING OF UCA [JOSE SIMEON CANAS
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY], THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF
CERTAIN PRIESTS IN THE SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS, THE AGITATION LAUNCHED BY
THE ALAS [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] PRIESTS, THE TRAGIC EPISODE
INVOLVING MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, AND THE USE OF THAT EPISODE BY
THE LEFT.  EL SALVADOR WAS, AND TO SOME EXTENT CONTINUES TO BE, THE
SCENARIO IN WHICH THE "THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION" REACHED ITS ULTIMATE
CONSEQUENCES BY PLACING THE INQUISITORIAL FANATICISM OF CERTAIN
PRIESTS AND PASTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MOST RADICAL CURRENTS OF
SOCIALISM.

   THE VIRULENCE OF THE ONSLAUGHT WENT THAT FAR PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE
PASSIVE ATTITUDE -- OR, RATHER, THE CONNIVING PERMISSIVENESS -- OF THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC REGIME, WHICH TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
STRIDENT CAMPAIGN TO FURTHER ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS.  DUARTE NEVER
TRULY DISTANCED HIMSELF FAR FROM THE GUERRILLAS BECAUSE OF HIS
ILL-DISGUISED IDEOLOGICAL LEANINGS, WHICH LED HIM TO COINCIDE IN GREAT
PART WITH THE SUBVERSIVES' TENETS AND ABOVE ALL WITH THE FANCIFUL IDEA
THAT THE PEOPLE APPROVED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNIST STATE IN
EL SALVADOR.

   IT IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER ORGANIZED SLANDER, TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION HOW FAR CERTAIN NOTIONS HAVE GONE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT
THEY RECEIVE FROM THE NEWS MEDIA IN A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD.  THE
POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESSFULLY COUNTERING THIS PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE MAY
NOT BE THE BEST, BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE TO REMAIN SILENT AND DO
NOTHING.  WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION OF A TRUE EFFORT TO
REJECT THE PERMANENT DEFAMATION BEING WITHSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY.

   THERE IS NO ANSWER TO THE ACCUSATIONS AND INSULTS ISSUED BY CERTAIN
SECTORS, EITHER.  TO ALLOW A PERSON WHO ACTS AS LEADER OF THE
TERRORISTS' POLITICAL FRONT TO COME TO THE COUNTRY AND SCOLD PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WITHOUT HAVING THE AUTHORITIES ARREST HIM FOR HIS
PARTICIPATION IN CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST THE REPUBLIC IS TO FALL
INTO DANGEROUS EXTREMES OF TOLERANCE.  WAS NOT JENNIFER CASOLO ALLOWED
TO OPENLY REPRESENT THE SUBVERSIVES FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT
INVESTIGATING HER MORE CLOSELY?  IS IT PERHAPS THAT THE LAWS ALLOW A
FOREIGNER TO MEDDLE IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS?

   HOW CAN JUDGES BE BANNED FROM CERTAIN INSTALLATIONS, SUCH AS THE THE
BOMBED FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
HEADQUARTERS, UNIVERSITIES, AND SIMILAR PLACES, WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT
GROUNDS TO SUSPECT THAT TERRORISTS ARE HIDDEN IN SUCH PLACES?

   BOGOTA, 26 JAN 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [INTERVIEW
WITH 19 APRIL MOVEMENT, M-19, LEADER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, BY
GLORIA ORTEGA] [TEXT] [ORTEGA] IN A REPORT FOR TELEVISION YESTERDAY
YOU POINTED OUT THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN COLOMBIA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT KIDNAPPINGS?

   [PIZARRO] WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE ALL HAVE TO BECOME UP TO
DATE, BUT BEING UP TO DATE DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE TO BECOME DARKER.
QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT MEANS SHEDDING MORE LIGHT ON LIFE.  WE ARE BENT
ON THIS.  OF COURSE, THIS ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ABANDON PRACTICES
LIKE KIDNAPPING.

   [ORTEGA] SURELY YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHO YOUR NEMESIS WAS 24 HOURS
AGO.  WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST REGARDING MILITARY TRAINING AND
ORIENTATION IN COLOMBIA?

   [PIZARRO] ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED FOR CENTURIES TO WIN
WARS.  IN COLOMBIA WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE MILITARY TO ACHIEVE PEACE,
PARTICULARLY PEACE AT HOME.  THE MILITARY HAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO
MAKE AND THERE ARE VALUABLE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT.  THE DEMOCRATIC
LINEAGE DOES NOT EXHAUST ITSELF IN GUERRILLAS, AND THERE IS ALSO A
GREAT DEMOCRATIC QUALITY IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DO YOU FEEL AFTER KILLING SO MANY POLICEMEN?

   [PIZARRO] WE WILL HAVE TO ASK THE POLICE WHAT THEY THINK AFTER
KILLING SO MANY GUERRILLAS.  WE HAVE LIVED IN VIOLENCE IN THIS
COUNTRY.  QUESTIONS DEALING WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR SHOULD BE AVOIDED.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU PASSED IN FRONT OF THE PALACE
OF JUSTICE YESTERDAY?

   [PIZARRO] I DID NOT DO THAT. I AM STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO WALKING
PAST THE PALACE OF JUSTICE.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL FEEL AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
PALACE?

   [PIZARRO] WELL, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING TO PONDER.

   [ORTEGA] ACCORDING TO WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME, SOME
COLOMBIAN SECTORS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU PEOPLE, WHO
STORMED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AMONG THE
MOST PROTECTED IN THIS COUNTRY.

   [PIZARRO] I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW COLOMBIA DEALT WITH THE FACT
THAT SANTANDER WAS THE FIRST MAN PARDONED IN COLOMBIA.

   [ORTEGA] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

   [PIZARRO] THAT MEANS THAT IF SANTANDER, A LAWMAKER, WAS PARDONED
AFTER HIS ATTEMPT ON BOLIVAR'S LIFE, AND WE ARE LIVING IN A NATION
BUILT LARGELY ON WHAT SANTANDER DID, THE LIFE OF MEN IS MADE OF LIGHT
AND SHADES.  AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE AS THEY ARE.

   MEDELLIN, 30 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIAS
HAVE DENIED THAT THEY ARE PREPARING AN ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF U.S.
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, WHO WILL VISIT THIS CARIBBEAN COLONIAL BEACH
RESORT ON 15 FEBRUARY FOR AN ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT MEETING.

   BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO, PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
WILL SIGN A MANIFESTO IN CARTAGENA THAT WAS DESIGNED IN SANTA CRUZ DE
LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA.  THE DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE STRATEGIES THAT THEY
WILL ADOPT TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE MYSTERIOUS CLANDESTINE GROUP THE "EXTRADITABLES," -- THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- SAID IN A BULLETIN
RELEASED EARLY THIS MORNING THAT THE REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE ATTACK ON
BUSH IN CARTAGENA ARE FALSE.

   "THESE REPORTS ARE PART OF A PLAN TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF
ALL OUR PEACE PROPOSALS," THE DOCUMENT SAID.  IN THE DOCUMENT, THE
"EXTRADITABLES" ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   LAST WEEKEND, THE U.S. CBS TELEVISION NETWORK REPORTED THE
POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK WITH ROCKETS AND MISSILES BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS
ON BUSH'S PLANE IN CARTAGENA.

   IN A STATEMENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO, THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF TERRORIST PLANS AGAINST
THE U.S. PRESIDENT, AND ADDED THAT U.S. AND COLOMBIAN SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS WERE CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING THE SAFETY OF THE FOUR
PRESIDENTS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES, A MAFIA GROUP BASED IN MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWEST
COLOMBIAN, HAS BEEN INSISTING SINCE 17 JANUARY THAT THEY WANT A PEACE
DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO,
WHO DECLARED WAR ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN AUGUST, 1989.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1077 (UNISYS)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [TEXT] IN THEIR INITIAL PEACE PROPOSAL, THE
EXTRADITABLES PROMISED THE SUSPENSION OF SHIPMENTS OF COCAINE TO THE
UNITED STATES, THE SURRENDER OF WEAPONS, AND THE RELEASE OF PEOPLE
THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED.

   IN COMPLYING WITH THESE PROMISES, THEY HAVE RELEASED IN GOOD
CONDITION SIX HOSTAGES AND THIS PAST MONDAY BEGAN TO DELIVER DYNAMITE
BY ABANDONING A SCHOOL BUS LOADED WITH 1,000 KG OF EXPLOSIVES SOUTH OF
MEDELLIN.

   IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE, THE EXTRADITABLES DENIED REPORTS THAT THEY
ARE HOLDING [COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL] GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA.
THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE EXTRADITABLES HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE MEDELLIN MEDIA TO SAY THAT THE
EXTRADITABLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.

   THEY SAY THAT AFTER HAVING RELEASED SIX HOSTAGES, THE HOLDING OF
GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE VISA OFFICE OF THE
COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, IN BOGOTA, "WOULD BE CONTRARY TO OUR PEACE
OFFERS."

   GARCIA-PENA ARCHILA WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED ADVISER TO THE COLOMBIAN
EMBASSY IN KOREA, A POST HE WAS SCHEDULED TO ASSUME FRIDAY, THE DAY HE
DISAPPEARED.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE OF TODAY THAT
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY WILL DELIVER A HELICOPTER BELONGING TO
THE COLOMBIAN FIRM HELICOL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HOLDING. THE HELICOPTER
IS LOADED WITH 500 KG OF DYNAMITE, THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES.

   THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THIS DYNAMITE "WAS GOING TO BE USED
AGAINST A MILITARY OBJECTIVE."  THE GROUP LED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
NOTES: "WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE TO
THE COUNTRY OUR GOOD WILL AND OUR WISH TO HAVE PEACE AND STRENGTHEN
DEMOCRACY."  


DEV-MUC3-1078 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE
ANNOUNCED ON 20 JANUARY THAT IT HAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE GUILT OF U.S.
CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS ARRESTED ON 24 NOVEMBER IN HER HOME IN
THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS CAPITAL, WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS
AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] WERE FOUND
BURIED IN THE YARD.

   CASOLO WAS ARRAIGNED 8 DAYS [AS PUBLISHED] AFTER HER ARREST, BUT
WAS RELEASED BY THE JUDGE "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE," ACCORDING TO THE
JUDICIAL RECORDS.

   ALTHOUGH IN SALVADORAN JUDICIAL CIRCLES IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY CASOLO
WAS RELEASED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL FACTORS
INVOLVED.

   AT PRESENT, CASOLO HEADS GROUPS THAT HAVE LAUNCHED A VIRULENT
CAMPAIGN AGAINST EL SALVADOR IN THE UNITED STATES, CLAIMING ALLEGED
"RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION."

   CASOLO WAS CAPTURED AFTER THE TERRORIST FAUSTO GALLARDO VALDEZ GAVE
HER NAME TO THE POLICE, TELLING THEM WHERE TO FIND THE WEAPONS THAT HE
AND HIS ACCOMPLICES USED FOR TERRORIST ACTS.  THE PRISONER SAID THAT
THE WEAPONS WERE PROVIDED BY CASOLO AT HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH SERVED AS A CLANDESTINE ARSENAL.

   IN VIEW OF THIS CONFESSION, THE POLICE REQUESTED THE PARTICIPATION
OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE COURSE
OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND WHEN THE WEAPONS WERE DUG UP IN FRONT OF CASOLO
HERSELF.

   WHEN CASOLO RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE
HAD BURIED DOCUMENTS IN THE YARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED, BUT SHE
LIED BY SAYING THAT SHE DID THIS BECAUSE "IN EL SALVADOR PEOPLE
COMMONLY BURY DOCUMENTS OR JEWELS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN BY
CRIMINALS."

   SOURCES SAY THAT AT PRESENT, AT THE HEAD OF GROUPS OF COMMUNISTS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO SUPPORT THEIR
SALVADORAN COUNTERPARTS, CASOLO HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO
DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNRMENT AND TO PRESSURE CONGRESS TO
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AID TO OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE COUNTRY
INSTITUTIONALLY AND STRENGTHEN THE FMLN-FDR TERRORIST GROUPS.

   THE POLICE REPORT THAT THE TERRORIST GALLARDO VALDEZ, FROM WHOM
WEAPONS AND AMMOUNITION WERE SEIZED ON 24 NOVEMBER, SAID THAT HE HAD
OBTAINED THE WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE A
FOREIGNER ON BARCELONA AVENUE, MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   THAT SAME DAY, POLICE INVESTIGATORS LOCATED THE HOUSE, IDENTIFIED
THE PERSON LIVING THERE, AND INVITED U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH.

   BURIED AT THE HOUSE THEY FOUND 103 SHELLS FOR 60-MM MORTARS, 213
STICKS OF TNT, 405 ELECTRIC DETONATING CAPS, 150 FEET OF SLOW FUSES,
15 KNIVES, 3 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, 12,510 AK-47 SHELLS,
9,110 M-16 RIFLE SHELLS, 325 G-3 RIFLE SHELLS, AND DOCUMENTS.

   IN HER UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, CASOLO SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO
ANY SUBVERSIVE GROUP OR ASSOCIATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE
ARTICLES CAME TO BE IN HER HOUSE.

   ON 5 DECEMBER, CASOLO AND A GROUP OF SALVADORANS WERE ARRAIGNED
BEFORE A MILITARY JUDGE, WHO 5 DAYS LATER RELEASED THEM "FOR LACK OF
EVIDENCE."

   ON 9 DECEMBER, POLICEMEN ARRESTED A WOMAN NAMED RUTH ESPERANZA
AGUILAR MARROQUIN, ALIAS MARINA, WHO WAS FLEEING AFTER HAVING PLACED A
BOMB IN THE ENGINE OF A BUS. ON BEING QUESTIONED, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN
ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, THAT THE PERSON IN
CHARGE OF LOGISTICS WAS THE AMERICAN, CASOLO, AND THAT SHE HAD
OBTAINED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AT CASOLO'S HOME IN MIRALVALLE.

   THE POLICE HAVE DENIED CASOLO'S CHARGES THAT DURING HER DETENTION
SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE, BECAUSE IT

   AYACUCHO, 28 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT TOMAS EVANGELISTA, A LEADER OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) AND DIRECTOR OF THE AYACUCHO DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION, WAS SHOT DEAD BY TERRORISTS HERE TODAY.

   THE POLICE SAID THAT A GROUP OF HOODED INDIVIDUALS EARLY THIS
MORNING ENTERED EVANGELISTA'S HOUSE AND, AFTER TYING THE HANDS OF HIS
WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN, TOOK EVANGELISTA OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHOT HIM
AT LEAST 20 TIMES.

   EVANGELISTA, WHO WAS 50 YEARS OLD, HAD HELD THE MOST IMPORTANT
REGIONAL APRA POSTS FOR 30 YEARS.

   EVANGELISTA'S WIFE TOLD THE POLICE THAT BEFORE HER HUSBAND WAS
KILLED, THE HOODED MAN SHOUTED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PRO-MAOIST
SHINING PATH TERRORIST GROUP.  ANTHROPOLOGIST ABIMAEL GUZMAN, THE
FOUNDER OF THE SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, WAS EVANGELISTA'S
PROFESSOR AT THE HUAMANGA UNIVERSITY IN AYACUCHO.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT ON 26 JANUARY SHINING
PATH TERRORISTS MURDERED BROTHERS MARTIZA AND JOHN PAOLO PUZO OCHOA
AND THEIR MOTHER MARTA OCHOA IN THE TOWNSHIP OF CAMPINA, 60 KM SOUTH
OF AYACUCHO.

   WITNESSES TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE OCHOAS WERE KILLED BECAUSE THEY
REFUSED TO SUPPLY FOOD AND LODGING TO THE TERRORISTS.

   MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SO FAR THIS MONTH OWING TO THE ARMED
STRUGGLE THAT THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BEGAN IN 1980 AND THAT HAS
ALREADY CLAIMED THE LIVES OF AT LEAST 17,700 PEOPLE AND CAUSED DAMAGE
OF OVER $16 BILLION, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THE 70 PERCENT OF THE
PERUVIAN FOREIGN DEBT.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 22 JAN 90 (LA HORA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO
SAID TODAY THAT "THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES," THUS CONFIRMING
THE STATEMENT GIVEN YESTERDAY, 21 JANUARY, BY ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER RAUL
CASTANEDA.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED: "WHAT HAPPENED WAS A RESULT OF SPECULATION.
THE GAS STATION OWNERS EXPECTED THE PRICES WOULD INCREASE WHEN THE
QUETZAL'S EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN."

   HE SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED IN A SHORT TIME BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE DIFFERENTIAL SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION."

   REFERRING TO THE WORKERS' DEMANDS FOR A SALARY INCREASE, PRESIDENT
CEREZO SAID THAT "WE ARE FACING PROBLEMS IN GRANTING THE INCREASE
BECAUSE THE 1990 BUDGET HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED."

   CEREZO ADDED: "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
CONTACTS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY
REQUESTING A BUDGET EXTENSION AND GETTING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO GRANT
A SALARY INCREASE IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR."

   PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE
INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WHICH WAS CREATED LAST WEEK TO SOLVE THE
DOUBLE MURDER PERPETRATED ON 19 JANUARY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH
OF SALVADORAN POLITICAL LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND GUATEMALAN
LAWYER HILDA AMPARO FLORES AREVALO.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PERSONALLY ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT IN
STATEMENTS HE GAVE TO THE MEDIA THIS MORNING IN ONE OF THE NATIONAL
PALACE HALLWAYS.

   OQUELI COLINDRES WAS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT OF EL SALVADOR AND HE WAS ONE OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
SECRETARIES FOR LATIN AMERICA.

   THE INVESTIGATION COMMISSION IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY, AND THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND TREASURY POLICE DIRECTORS GENERAL.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID: "THE COMMISSION'S TASK IS TO CLEAR ALL
DOUBTS AND PROVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT ASSASSINATION OF THESE TWO
PERSONS."

   CEREZO REASSERTED THAT "ALL DOUBTS WILL BE CLEARED UP CONCERNING
THIS GRAVE ACT OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO PARTICIPATION
WHATSOEVER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ANYONE."

   THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION HAS IMMEDIATELY BEGUN WORK.  THE
PRESIDENT EMPHASIZED THAT "HE WILL PERSONALLY SUPERVISE THE WORK BEING
CARRIED OUT TO GUARANTEE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S FIRM INTENTION OF
NOT LETTING THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL THE SECTORS OF
THE NATION, GO UNPUNISHED."

   BOGOTA, 30 JAN 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] AT THIS
TIME, THERE IS HEAVY FIGHTING AND EVEN ARMY BOMBING OF FARC [REVOLUTIONARY
ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] CAMPS NEAR URIBE IN META DEPARTMENT. THE CLASHES
ARE TAKING PLACE IN JARDIN DE LAS PENAS, IN MESETAS MUNICIPALITY, NEAR WHERE
THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FARC SECRETARIAT IS LOCATED.

   THIS REACTION BY THE MILITARY IS IN ANSWER TO A FARC AMBUSH OF A
MILITARY PATROL ON 28 JANUARY, RESULTING IN FIVE SOLDIERS DEAD AND
SEVEN WOUNDED. IN ADDITION, THE ARMY'S INTENSIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO DUE
TO THE DESIRE TO PUT A STOP TO FARC ATTACKS AND KIDNAPPINGS OF
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEADERS IN THE AREA.

   LIMA, 30 JAN 90 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [REPORT] [EXCERPTS]
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS CALLED FOR CALM AND SERIOUSNESS IN THE
POLITICAL DEBATES AMONG THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.  HE DESCRIBED ONE
OF THEM AS BEING INTELLECTUALLY IMMATURE IN VIEW OF THE CONSTANT
ATTACKS THE LATTER ALWAYS MAKES.  THE RIGHT, GARCIA SAID, MUST BE
TAUGHT A LESSON OF MATURITY AND SERIOUSNESS.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE FIRST SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSION
WILL BE HELD FROM 5-6 FEBRUARY TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS INTERNAL BORDER
DELIMITATIONS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT NO NEW CENTRAL BANK DIRECTOR WILL BE
APPOINTED, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TO DO SO.

   FOR THE TIME BEING, THE PRESIDENT ADDED, HE CANNOT EITHER CONFIRM
OR DENY THAT HE WILL ATTEND THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE
THE SITUATION IN PANAMA COULD CHANGE IN THE REMAINING 15 DAYS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THERE ARE STILL 16 DAYS
UNTIL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT.  HAVE YOU MADE A FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER
YOU WILL ATTEND OR NOT?

   [GARCIA] NO, I HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION YET BECAUSE PERUVIAN
FOREIGN POLICY FOLLOWS ITS PRINCIPLES, WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC -- DESPITE WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY -- FOLLOWS HIS, AND THESE
PRINCIPLES ARE LOYAL TO CERTAIN ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS.

   WE ARE YET NOT COMPLETELY SURE THAT THE INVADING COUNTRY, THE
UNITED STATES, IS TOTALLY WILLING TO OR INTENDS TO WITHDRAW ITS
SOLDIERS FROM A SMALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.  AS LONG AS THIS DOES
NOT OCCUR, AS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, IT IS DESPICABLE AND NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ABUSING A
SMALL COUNTRY WITH HIS ALMIGHTY POSITION.  MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN
15 OR 16 DAYS.

   I AM NOT SAYING EITHER YES OR NO, BUT I THINK THAT THINGS MUST
SOMEHOW CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN ORDER TO HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING.
UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE PRESIDENTS
CAN HOLD A CORDIAL MEETING AS LONG AS ONE OF THEM IS PLACING AN ATOMIC
BOMB AND THE THREAT OF INVASION ON THE TABLE.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [GARCIA] YES, I THINK THAT THAT MAGAZINE IS WELL INFORMED, BECAUSE
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  AS YOU KNOW, EXPERTS FROM THE
FOUR COUNTRIES MET IN SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA, TO PREPARE A
DOCUMENT.  WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE READY TO SIGN THE FINAL
DOCUMENT, ONE OF THE COUNTRIES PROPOSED SOME MODIFICATIONS CHANGING
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONCEPT.

   THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, 4 AND 1/2 YEARS AGO, I
TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM OF HELICOPTERS OR
BULLETS.  THIS IS A PROBLEM OF BETTER PRICES FOR COCOA, COFFEE, AND
ANNATTO SEEDS.  THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESSING FACTORIES IN THE
HIGHER HUALLAGA VALLEY AREA AND AIRLINES THAT TRANSPORT THESE PRODUCTS
TO THE UNITED STATES.

   THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AFTER 4 AND 1/2 YEARS; WHEN IT WAS
FINALLY ABOUT TO BE PUT DOWN IN THE DOCUMENT IN SANTA CRUZ, ONE OF THE
COUNTRIES MODIFIED IT, THUS HINDERING FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE
NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS SUBJECT IS NOW BEING REVIEWED, AND THE SUMMIT
COULD BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL WE REACH FULL AGREEMENT ON
SUCH AN IMPORTANT SUMMIT, WHICH WAS PROPOSED BY THE PERUVIAN
PRESIDENCY.

   WE MUST GATHER AT THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL.
IT CANNOT BE SIMPLY A SOCIAL GATHERING.  WE ARE NOT TEENAGERS WHO ARE
ATTENDING THE MEETING SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WILL BE THERE.  WE CANNOT GO THERE AS
DESPERATE AND DAZZLED YOUNGSTERS TO HOLD HIS HAND.  WE MUST MAKE
CONCRETE PROPOSALS TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR PERU, WORK AND HONOR FOR THE
HUALLAGA VALLEY PEASANTS, AND RESPECT FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY SINCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE
PROBLEM IS IN THE CONSUMERS OF THE RICH COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE
UNITED STATES.  [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS TODAY REAFFIRMED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO AGREE ON A DATE TO RESUME
THE DIALOGUE AND THEY PROPOSED A CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR A
SUSPENSION OF U.S. AID.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE FROM THE GENERAL COMMAND, THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) EXPRESSED THE NEED TO "REORIENT" THE
TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION SO AS TO TURN THEM INTO A
NATIONAL PROCESS IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
FORCES CAN PARTICIPATE.

   "WE BELIEVE THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED
AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.
THE SUSPENSION OF THAT AID COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED.

   THE FMLN'S MESSAGE COINCIDED WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS, WHERE TODAY HE WILL MEET WITH JAVIER
PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO REQUEST HIS GOOD OFFICES TO ACHIEVE THE RESUMPTION
OF THE TALKS WITH THE REBELS, WHICH HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER.

   THE GUERRILLAS STATED THAT THEY HOPE THAT CRISTIANI'S MEETING WITH
PEREZ DE CUELLAR WILL LEAD TO SETTING A DATE FOR A FUTURE MEETING.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN RECALLED THE 11 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE AND
WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S INSISTENCE OF THE GUERRILLAS' ALLEGED
MILITARY WEAKNESS "WILL ONLY LEAD TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION."

   THE GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED THEIR "CONCERN" ABOUT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S MEDIATION ROLE,
DESCRIBING THE REJECTION AS "AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCEDURE DESIGNED TO
BRING SERIOUSNESS TO THE NEGOTIATING EFFORT."

   "ON OUR PART," THE COMMUNIQUE STATED, "WE ACCEPT THAT MEDIATION AND
WE HAVE MADE EFFORTS TOWARD ACHIEVING IT."

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WANTS PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO PLAY ONLY THE
ROLE OF OBSERVER IN THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   SINCE ALFREDO CRISTIANI TOOK OFFICE ON 1 JUNE, THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN HAVE HELD TWO ROUNDS OF TALKS, THE FIRST IN MEXICO IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND IN COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT THE FMLN SHOULD GIVE UP ITS WEAPONS
AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AS A PARTY.  HOWEVER, THE GUERRILLAS
DEMAND A PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES AND AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
IN EXCHANGE FOR A CEASE-FIRE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
[ALFREDO VILLAREAL] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED
FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, TODAY POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S
SITUATION DOES NOT WARRANT LIFTING THE CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE.  THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS EXPECTED TO DISCUSS WHETHER TO CONTINUE THIS
MEASURE NEXT WEEK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR STANCE IS COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE THROUGHOUT
OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY.  WE WILL MAINTAIN THIS POLICY WHETHER THERE IS A
STATE OF SIEGE OR NOT. [END RECORDING]

   THE TOP MILITARY LEADER COMMENTED ON THE DECISION THAT THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MUST MAKE ON 8 FEBRUARY.  COL PONCE SAID THAT
THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION AND WHATEVER THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
DECIDES WILL BE RESPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT
FULL GUARANTEES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE NONEXISTENT IF THIS
MEASURE IS REPEALED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE WILL RESPECT THE DECISION OF THE
INSTITUTIONS TASKED WITH MAKING THE DECISION.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION
IS NOT YET NORMAL ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE.
HOWEVER, THE DECISION IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSEMBLY OR THE GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS FOR
LIFTING THE STATE OF SIEGE?

   [PONCE] THE PLANS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN].  THE FMLN PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND
INDISCRIMINATE ACTIONS, AND ITS ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AND THE
COUNTRYSIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS.  THE SITUATION
IS NOT YET NORMAL. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR AN OFFENSIVE THAT THE FMLN HAD PLANNED FOR LAST WEEK, THE
MILITARY LEADER SAID THAT IT WAS FOILED BECAUSE ARMY INTELLIGENCE
DETECTED IT IN TIME.  COL PONCE ADDED THAT THE MOST RECENT GUERRILLA
ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL AIM TO FRIGHTEN CIVILIANS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN IS SEEKING TO MAINTAIN
A PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR AND COMPLETE INSECURITY AND DISTRUST AMONG THE
POPULATION, BECAUSE THIS WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR.  THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A
PURELY TERRORIST, SELECTIVE, AND INDISCRIMINATE SCHEME.  I HAVE MENTIONED
THE INDISCRIMINATE NATURE BEFORE.  THEIR RECENT ATTACKS ARE SELECTIVE.  THEY
SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT, CREATE DISTRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND
CREATE INSECURITY. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE VICTORIA AND MARTILLO OPERATIONS, COL PONCE SAID THAT
THE FMLN HAD SUSTAINED 2,352 DEAD FROM 11 NOVEMBER 1989 TO 30 JANUARY
1990, AND HE REGRETTED THE DEATH OF 537 ARMY TROOPS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COL GUILLERMO ALFREDO
BENAVIDES, PRIMARY PERSON IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND THEIR TWO EMPLOYEES, WAS OFFICIALLY REMOVED TODAY FROM HIS
POST AS DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY MILITARY SCHOOL.

   BENAVIDES' REPLACEMENT WAS PART OF A HIGH-LEVEL REORGANIZATION IN
THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCES,
REFLECTS AN INTENTION TO MAKE GRADUAL CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

   BENAVIDES, WHO IS ACCUSED OF HAVING GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL THE
JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN), WILL BE REPLACED AS
DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL BY COL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA, WHO
WAS FORMERLY COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, BASED IN THE
EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT.

   COL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, WHO TO DATE HAS BEEN DIRECTOR OF THE
TREASURY POLICE, WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO USULUTAN, A DEPARTMENT WHERE
GUERRILLAS ARE CONSTANTLY ACTIVE.  HERNANDEZ WILL BE REPLACED BY COL
CIRO LOPEZ ROQUE.

   IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND THE TREASURY POLICE, THE
CHANGES PRIMARILY AFFECT COMMANDERS IN THE AREAS OF PERSISTENT
GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, SUCH AS USULUTAN AND CHALATENANGO, AND THE ARCE
BATTALION, AN ELITE UNIT TO COMBAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), WHICH IS BASED IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF
SAN MIGUEL.

   THESE TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMENTS AFFECT A TOTAL OF 12 COLONELS AND,
ALTHOUGH THE ARMED FORCES DESCRIBED THEM TODAY AS "ROUTINE CHANGES,"
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES FEEL THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SEEK GREATER
EFFICIENCY IN MILITARY ACTION.  THE SOURCES FEEL THAT MORE CHANGES
WILL BE MADE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR.

   THE FIRST RESHUFFLING IN THE ARMED FORCES FOR 1990 WAS ANNOUNCED ON
1 JANUARY, THAT IS, SHORTLY AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE, THE SCALE OF
WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE ARMY ITSELF, AS MILITARY SOURCES ADMITTED.

   ON THAT DATE, GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS MOST OPENLY OPPOSED TO DIALOGUE
WITH THE FMLN, WAS RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES AND SENT TO EUROPE AS A
MILITARY ATTACHE.

   REPLACED WITH BUSTILLO WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY DETACHMENTS
OF CUSCATLAN AND LA UNION, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHIEF OF ARMY INTELLIGENCE.

   CLANDESTINE, 2 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. WE SEE AS POSITIVE THAT MR CRISTIANI HAS ACCEPTED UN SECRETARY
GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEGOTIATION
PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR.  WE FEEL THAT THE MEDIATION OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
SERIOUSLY COMMIT BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATION AND OFFER TRUE
POSSIBILITIES SO THAT THE PROCESS WILL LEAD TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT
WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.

   2. IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, IT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE THAT THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INCREASED IN THE FORTHCOMING
FISCAL PERIODS.  IF THIS DECISION IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IT
WOULD MEAN A DEFINITE DETERMINATION TO PROLONG THE WAR AND THE FAILURE
OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THE ASSISTANCE STRENGTHENS THE EXTREMISTS.  THE
POLITICAL PRESSURE MAKES IT NECESSARY TO TAKE POLITICAL ACTIONS AND
STRENGTHENS THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.

   3. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT PERMANENT MILITARY OFFENSIVES
AND REPRESSION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE A STATE OF SIEGE, MURDERS,
ARRESTS, AND PERSECUTION AGAINST PEOPLE'S AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS;
THE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE CONTROLLED; AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
CONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS THE EVACUATION OF FMLN WAR CRIPPLES IS NOT
ALLOWED.

   COL PONCE OPENLY PROCLAIMS HIS "VICTORY AND HAMMER" OFFENSIVE
AGAINST FMLN POSITIONS.  THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE, AS THE GOVERNMENT
WANTS THE FMLN TO UNILATERALLY SUSPEND OPERATIONS.  AS LONG AS THERE
ARE REPRESSION AND LARGE MILITARY OFFENSIVES, AND A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT
AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, WE ARE OBLIGED TO REMAIN AT WAR AND MAKE
OFFENSIVE USE OF OUR MILITARY FORCE IN ANY PART OF THE NATION TO
ACHIEVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATION THAT WILL FIND A JUST SOLUTION TO THE WAR.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 2 FEB 90 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] SOME PEOPLE NAIVELY THINK THAT A COUNTRY CURRY FAVOR WITH THE
U.S. JUST BY BEING DEMOCRATIC. SOME PEOPLE HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES AT
THE SERVICE OF THIS SUPERPOWER, AS LONG AS THE SUPERPOWER HAS HAD NEED
OF THEM.  HOWEVER, ONCE THEY HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS, NOT ONLY
ARE THEY ABANDONED, BUT NOW THEY ARE EVEN KIDNAPPED, JAILED, AND
SENTENCED.

   THIS HAPPENED TO PEREZ JIMENEZ OF VENEZUELA; LEONIDAS TRUJILLO OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE CIA; SOMOZA OF
NICARAGUA; AND LATELY NORIEGA OF PANAMA.

   THESE MEN ARE VALUED ONLY AS LONG AS THEY ARE USEFUL TO THE UNITED
STATES. ONCE THEY ARE NO LONGER USEFUL, THEY ARE NO LONGER REGARDED AS
MEN.  APPARENTLY SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENS WITH COUNTRIES.  IF A
COUNTRY HAS ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY, OR STRATEGIC VALUE, THAT COUNTRY
WILL ENJOY WASHINGTON'S PREFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE INTEREST NO
LONGER EXISTS, THE AID IS OVER. IF THE INTEREST DECREASES, THE AID
DECRESES.

   HONDURAS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS POLICY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.
THE POINDEXTER TRIAL SHOWED THAT OVER THE SENATE'S OBJECTION, SPECIAL
AID WAS GRANTED TO HONDURAS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVERTING IT INTO A
LEASED TERRITORY FOR CONTRA OPERATIONS.

   THE YEARS IN WHICH OUR TERRITORY SHAMEFULLY SERVED TO SHED BLOOD IN
ONE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, ARE YEARS IN WHICH HONDURAS WAS
REGARDED AS A COUNTRY DESERVING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID.

   WITH THE CHANGE OF U.S. POLICY, AFTER IT ACCEPTED ITS MILITARY
FAILURE AGAINST NICARAGUA, HONDURAS IS NO LONGER THE APPLE OF ITS EYE,
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES.  THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOT
ONLY GRUDGING ITS AID, BUT IS NOT EVEN GRANTING THE SCANT AID ALREADY
APPROVED, UNLESS HONDURAS AGREES TO ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.

   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS THE IMF'S MOST
IMPORTANT MEMBER AND SUPPORTER, IT HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN THE
SCREWS ON HONDURAS, AND TO EVEN LET HONDURAS USE UP ITS MEAGER GOLD
RESERVES UNTIL HONDURAS IS FORCED TO SAY, "FORGIVE ME, MASTER."

   AS WE CAN RECALL, WHEN THE GOLD STANDARD WAS ABANDONED FOR THE
DOLLAR STANDARD AND SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS, THE IMF, AND OTHER
MEASURES WERE CREATED, EACH COUNTRY DEPOSITED GOLD RESEVES TO BACK UP
ITS CURRENCY EXCHANGE.  THEREAFTER, ITS MONETARY BACKING WOULD DEPEND
ON ITS RESERVE OF DOLLARS AND OTHER STRONG CURRENCIES.

   THAT IS HOW GETTING FOREIGN RESERVES BECAME THE MAIN CONCERN OF
NATIONS, IF THEY WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY.

   AS A RESULT OF THE OIL CRISIS, WHICH ON THE ONE HAND SAVED THE
OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AND ON THE OTHER HAND DEALT A BLOW TO THE OIL
IMPORTERS, PLUS THE UNCONTROLLED FOREIGN DEBT THAT THE PETRODOLLARS
BOOM BROUGHT WITH IT, THE COUNTRIES WENT TO THE HILT IN DEBT.  AT THE
SAME TIME THEY LOST HUGE SUMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF
THE DROP IN THE PRICES OF COFFEE, SILVER, TIN, COPPER, AND OTHER
EXPORT PRODUCTS.

   IN SHORT, THE SOURCE OF EXCHANGE DECREASED FOR EVERYONE, EVEN
THOUGH PRODUCTION OF EACH ITEM INCREASED.  DEBTS GREW UNTIL THEY
BECAME NIGHTMARES THAT ABSORBED ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN
INCOME.  THE MONETARY RESERVES THAT WERE BACKING THE CURRENCIES FELL.
THAT IS WHY IN LATIN AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ONE DEVALUATION AFTER
ANOTHER, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY.

   IN THE BEGINNING THE IMF USED WHAT WAS CALLED A STAND-BY LOAN, WHICH
HELPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF RESERVES.  WITH THOSE EMERGENCY
LOANS THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY, UNTIL THEY COULD
BALANCE THEIR RESERVES.

   HOWEVER, COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS, WHICH WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED, BEGAN
TO FILL THEIR LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES WITH LOANS AND DONATIONS.
EVEN SO THE COUNTRY CONTINUED TO PAY ITS IMPORTS AND EXPENSES IN
FOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNTIL IT REACHED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH WE
CANNOT PAY THE DEBT. WE ARE OVERDUE $140 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON OUR
DEBT. OUR CREDIT IS NO LONGER GOOD. THE IMF HAS NO MORE MONEY TO GIVE
TO HONDURAS TO CONTINUE ITS VICIOUS CYCLE OF GETTING INTO DEBT TO PAY
OFF ITS DEBTS.  YET THE UNITED STATES HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN OUR
SCREWS.  [CONTINUED]

SANTANDER GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER]
[TEXT] [REPORTER] WE ARE SAYING HELLO AT THIS HOUR TO NORTH SANTANDER
GOVERNOR EDUARDO ASSAF ELCURE.  DR ASSAF, GOOD DAY.

   [ASSAF] GOOD MORNING, RCN [STATION CALL SIGN].

   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE DEPARTMENTAL
ADMINISTRATION HAVE ABOUT EVENTS DEALING WITH PUBLIC ORDER, SUCH AS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN ARBOLEDAS [MURDER OF ARBOLEDAS MAYOR PEDRO
JESUS HERNANDEZ].

   [ASSAF] THE OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE REGRETTABLE CASE IN ARBOLEDAS
AT NOON TODAY, AND THOSE CARRIED BY RCN AND OTHER STATIONS, DESCRIBING
THE WAY IN WHICH MAYOR PEDRO JESUS HERNANDEZ WAS MURDERED WHILE
INAUGURATING A DINING HALL FOR CHILDREN AT JUAN BUENO, ARBOLEDAS
MUNICIPALITY, LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING EXTREMELY SERIOUS IS
HAPPENING.  HERNANDEZ WAS GOING TO INAUGURATE ON 20-25 FEBRUARY FOUR
OR FIVE WORKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
COMMUNITIES AND HAD BEEN DEMANDED BY THEM FOR A LONG TIME.  THIS LEADS
US TO BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION IS REALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT OTHER
MEASURES WILL HAVE TO BE ADOPTED TO PREVENT A CONTINUATION OF THESE
REGRETTABLE ACTIONS, WHICH DESTABILIZE PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT.

   I THINK THAT AFTER THE PEACE TALKS WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] ARE
CONCLUDED NEXT WEEK, DR. OCTAVIO PARDO SHOULD IN SOME WAY PROMOTE A TRUCE
WITH THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY [ELN] AND THE EPL [POPULAR LIBERATION
ARMY] TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND KEEP THE BLOODSHED
FROM CONTINUING IN OUR COUNTRY, MOST PARTICULARLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT.  OVER
THE COURSE OF A MONTH, TWO MAYORS, WHO WERE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FIGHTINGEST
MAYORS -- IN THE SENSE THAT THEY LAUNCHED, EXECUTED, AND COMPLETED WORKS --
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN OUR DEPARTMENT.

   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, HOW MANY MAYORS DID YOU SAY HAVE BEEN
KILLED DURING THAT TIME?

   [ASSAF] WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   [REPOERTER] MR. GOVERNOR, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, FOR INSTANCE, CIVIC
OR POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE AREA OF NORTH SANTANDER CAN PARTICIPATE IN
TALKS WITH THE EPL AND THE ELN TO MAKE SERIOUS PROPOSALS TO THE
GOVERNMENT ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUCE, AS YOU SUGGEST?

   [ASSAF] IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT SITUATION, THAT IS, IN VIEW OF THE
FACT THAT A MONTH AGO THE MAYOR OF ABREGO WAS KILLED AND THE ARBOLEDAS
MAYOR WAS KILLED YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY IS PLEASED THAT
THE PACIFICATION PROCESS WITH M-19 WILL END THIS WEEK.  SO, WHY NOT
LOOK FOR AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE [1-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] AND THE EPL TO ESTABLISH A TRUCE, AT LEAST DURING THIS
ELECTORAL PERIOD, SO THAT ALL COLOMBIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF NORTH
SANTANDER, CAN FREELY EXERCISE THEIR SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN
AN ELECTION AND EXPRESS THEIR SATISFACTION WITH OR CONDEMNATION OF THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY GOVERNING THE MUNICIPALITIES?  [CONTINUED]

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH GARCIA BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD THE
OPINION, FOR EXAMPLE, OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, PROBABLY ALSO THAT OF ENCI
[NATIONAL ENTERPRISE FOR INDUSTRIAL MARKETING], CASA, THE CORA PROJECT
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE COCA GROWERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW DAYS
AGO STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT AGAINST THE ERADICATION OF COCA
PLANTATIONS BUT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE AGRARIAN BANK'S UNSATISFACTORY
SERVICE IN GRANTING LOANS.  THIS COMMUNIQUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE MEDIA
A FEW DAYS AGO.

   [GARCIA] YES, WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND ARE ANALYZING IT.  BUT THE
PROBLEM OF THE 200,000 HECTARES USED FOR ILLEGAL COCA GROWING BY FAR
EXCEEDS THE CAPACITY OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, OF THE NATIONAL COCA LEAF
ENTERPRISE [EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LA COCA], OR THE ENCI TO FINANCE
FERTILIZER.  THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED AT THE
CONTINENTAL LEVEL.  THE HUALLAGA VALLEY IS AN ENCLAVE OF THE U.S.
CONSUMERS.  IT IS A PERVERSE PROBLEM WITH ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS AND
IT IS DISTORTING AND DESTROYING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR PLANTING OTHER
CROPS IN THAT AREA.  THIS IS WHY WE MUST CONSIDER IT FROM A
CONTINENTAL VIEWPOINT, DISCUSSING IT WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE THE
PROBLEM ORIGINATES, WHERE IT IS CONSUMED.  THE ENCI AND THE AGRARIAN
BANK PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE OVERALL PROBLEM.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IS IT TRUE -- AS IT WAS SAID IN THE
UNITED STATES -- THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO REPLACE
THE PLANTATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY CONVENIENT?

   [GARCIA] NO, ACCORDING TO SOLID INFORMATION I HAVE AT HAND FROM THE
STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, OUR
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE GREATEST EFFORTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS TO
ERADICATE COCA PLANTATIONS.  A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY RELEASED A REPORT
TO THE U.S. MEDIA FROM MAY 1989 THAT SHOWED THAT PERU HAD BROKEN ALL
RECORDS FOR ERADICATING COCA IN 1988, IN KEEPING WITH ITS
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  PERU ERADICATED MORE THAN 5,000 HECTARES OF
COCA PLANTATIONS THAT YEAR, THUS STABILIZING THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF
HECTARES USED FOR COCA GROWING.  NOBODY, MUCH LESS THE UNITED STATES,
CAN SAY THAT PERU HAS DONE NOTHING.

   WE HAVE CARRIED OUT VAST OPERATIONS AND HAVE CONTINUED OUR SILENT
TASK TO ERADICATE THESE PLANTATIONS, SOMETIMES WITH REGRETTABLE
CONSEQUENCES.  THE PEASANT WHO IS FACED WITH BARE LAND AFTER THE COCA
IS UPROOTED EITHER ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR IS CONDEMNED TO
LIVE IN MISERY.  THIS IS WHY WE NEED AN OVERALL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVE THAT MUST BE PART OF A REEVALUATED LATIN
AMERICAN-U.S. RELATIONSHIP.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THE SITUATION IS NOW THE OPPOSITE TO WHAT
THE UNITED STATES IS DOING FOR [WORDS INDISTINCT] A MEETING PUT
FORWARD BY THE PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE THEY GIVE $1 TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING WHILE THERE ARE $100 FOR CONSUMPTION.

   [GARCIA] YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOTAL COST OF
COCAINE SOLD ON THE U.S. STREETS IS $100 BILLION.  ONLY $8 OR $9
MILLION IS BEING OFFERED TO FIGHT THE ILLEGAL PRODUCTION OF COCA AND
 TO REPLACE THE CROPS HERE IN PERU.  WHAT THE UNITED STATES -- THE       
MAIN CONSUMER -- HAS BEEN OFFERING IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM.

   IF THERE WERE NO CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PERU WOULD NOT
PRODUCE COCA LEAVES, EXCEPT FOR THE TRADITIONAL, ANCIENT USES OF
PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  THE PROBLEM BEGINS THERE.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
PROVIDING MASSIVE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ASSUMED THROUGH CONCERTED
DIALOGUE, NOT UNILATERAL MEASURES, BECAUSE THERE ARE HAWKS IN THE
UNITED STATES.  THE HAWKS ARE THE BOLDEST MILITARISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT
TROOPS CAN BE SENT TO THE HUALLAGA VALLEY, THUS SOLVING THIS SERIOUS
PROBLEM.

   SUCH AN ACTION WOULD REPRESENT THE VIOLATION OF A NATION'S
SOVEREIGNTY, AN UNWANTED UNILATERAL INTERVENTION.  WE WANT A SERIOUS,
RESPONSIBLE, CONCERTED, FAR-REACHING SOCIOECONOMIC POLICY.  THIS IS
OUR OBJECTIVE FOR CARTAGENA.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, CHANGING THE SUBJECT, THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN HAS ENTERED THE FINAL STRETCH.  OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE
CONSTANTLY MENTIONED YOUR NAME AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OR HAVE NOT
SAID.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE CAMPAIGN?

   [GARCIA] THOSE ARE MINOR SINS BY THE OPPOSITION.  THEY ARE USING
ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT TOTALLY LEGITIMATE, BUT I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME
PASSING JUDGMENT ON MY DEAR FRIEND ENRIQUE CHIRINO SOTO OR ON ANY OF
THE LAWMAKERS.  I UNDERSTAND THEIR DESIRE AND THEIR NEED TO BE
ELECTED.  OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD THEY DO IN THE FUTURE?  IF THEY WANT TO
USE MY NAME, LET THEM USE IT, EVEN IF IT'S IN A NEGATIVE WAY.  I HAVE
LISTENED TO SO MANY THINGS OVER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS IN OFFICE THAT I
AM ACTUALLY A LITTLE PLEASED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESPERATELY
USING MY NAME.  AT LEAST I AM HELPING THEM.

   [REPORTER] SINCE THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD ON 8 APRIL, WHEN WILL
SCHOOL CLASSES BEGIN?

   [GARCIA] I SAW THAT THE EDUCATION MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE ANNOUNCING
THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN ON 1 OR 2 APRIL.  I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TO
THE EDUCATION MINISTER THAT CLASSES BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL.  IT WOULD BE
MEANINGLESS TO BEGIN CLASSES AND TO THEN DISCONTINUE THEM IN ORDER TO
OPEN THE SCHOOLS FOR THE ELECTIONS.  CLASSES COULD THEREFORE BEGIN ON
10 APRIL OR WHEN THE MINISTRY DECIDES.  THIS SHOULD BE AFTER 8 APRIL.
WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ON OPENING THE VOTING SITES.
I AM ANNOUNCING THAT CLASSES WILL BEGIN AFTER 8 APRIL.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 90 (CNA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS
ROMERO SAID TUESDAY HONDURAS IS FACING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION
AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN HELP A GREAT DEAL IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS
CONFRONTING HIS COUNTRY.

   CALLEJAS, INAUGURATED ON JAN. 27, TOLD THE CNA HONDURAS IS FACING A
CRISIS WHICH HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION, WITH HELP AND SUPPORT FROM THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WILL BE ABLE TO TIDE OVER.

   HONDURAS LACKS FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO BUY OIL, MEDICINE AND FOOD FROM
ABROAD.  TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBTS TOTAL WELL OVER U.S.  DLRS
[DOLLARS] 200 MILLION.  "WE ARE FACING A STEEP SHORTAGE OF BASIC
FOODS, CORN IN PARTICULAR," CALLEJAS SAID.

   A POTENTIALLY RICH COUNTRY, HONDURAS CAN OVERCOME ALL ITS DIFFICULT
PROBLEMS AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY IN THE LONG RUN, BUT IT NEEDS A SHOT
IN THE ARM, CALLEJAS SAID.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, CALLEJAS APPEALED, CAN EXTEND "SHORT-TERM
BRIDGE LOANS" TO HONDURAS TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF ACUTE SHORTAGE
IN FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES.  "A SHORT-TERM CREDIT OF DLRS 5
MILLION, FOR INSTANCE, CAN HELP US MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTAGE AND THEN
WE CAN MOVE AHEAD," CALLEJAS SAID.

   "THE SITUATION IS A CRITICAL ONE," CALLEJAS SAID, "BUT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO COPE WITH IT AND SURGE AHEAD FOR GREATER PROSPERITY, AND WHAT
WE NOW NEED IS A SHORT-TERM HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE REPUBLIC OF
CHINA."

   HE SAID THE PEOPLE OF HONDURAS HAVE YET TO SENSE THE CRISIS THEY
ARE FACING NOW.  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, IN PARTICULAR, IS COMPARABLE TO
THE ONE THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FACED IN AND SHORTLY AFTER 1950.

   "MY ADMINISTRATION KNOWS WHAT SHALL BE DONE," CALLEJAS SAID.  HE
WILL LET THE PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS AND CULTIVATE A SENSE
OF CRISIS THAT IS NEEDED TO RALLY THEMSELVES BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT TO
MOVE FORWARD.

   THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAVE SET A "GOOD EXAMPLE" FOR
OTHER NATIONS IN CRISIS TO FOLLOW, CALLEJAS SAID.  "OVER THE PAST 40
YEARS," HE POINTED OUT, "YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO
OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY."

   ASIDE FROM THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT, THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN SEND A
HIGH-LEVEL MISSION TO ADVISE HONDURAS ON HOW TO SOLVE ITS LONG-TERM
FINANCIAL PROBLEM, CALLEJAS SAID.  "YOUR COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE IN
THIS FIELD," HE ADDED, "AND WE HOPE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR
EXPERIENCE."

   ANOTHER FIELD OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS TRADE AND
INVESTMENT, CALLEJAS SAID.  HONDURAS IS SETTING UP AN INDUSTRIAL PARK,
AND INVESTMENT FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS MORE THAN WELCOME, HE
ADDED.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS OPENING ITS MARKET TO FOREIGN IMPORTS, AND
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TAIWAN'S TOBACCO MARKET, IF HONDURAS CAN EARN
IT, "WILL HELP A GREAT DEAL AND START A CHAIN ACTION OF DEVELOPMENT,"
CALLEJAS SAID.  THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF
TOBACCO CAN BE USED TO PAY BACK SOME OF TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBT.
THE REPAYMENT WILL EARN MORE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, WHICH IN TURN
SUPPORTS OTHER PROJECTS OF DEVELOPMENT.

   THE PRESENCE OF A U.N. MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP IN HONDURAS,
CALLEJAS SAID, WILL HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
THE MISSION IS TO HELP EASE THE TENSION ALONG THE BORDERS OF EL
SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED BY GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES.

   CALLEJAS HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TWICE BEFORE.  HE TOURED
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN 1968 AND
AGAIN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PARTY IN 1988.

   ASKED IF HE WOULD ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION IN TAIPEI ON
MAY 20, CALLEJAS SAID HE WOULD "TRY MY BEST TO GO (TO TAIPEI) MYSELF."
IF HE IS UNABLE TO ATTEND, HE ADDED, HE WILL SEND HIS PRESIDENT OF THE
NATIONAL CONGRESS, RODOLFO IRIAS NAVAS.

   "IF I CANNOT VISIT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN MAY," CALLEJAS SAID, "I
WILL MAKE A VISIT TO YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR."  MOST
LIKELY, HE ADDED, HE WILL PAY A STATE VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA
IN NOVEMBER.

   IN RETURN, CALLEJAS SAID, "WE WILL BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT LI, VISIT US."

   RELATIONS BETWEEN HONDURAS AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ARE "EXTREMELY
CLOSE ONES," CALLEJAS SAID.  "AND WE IN HONDURAS HOPE TO FURTHER
CEMENT THOSE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONS," HE POINTED OUT.

   SUCH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE MONOPOLIZED BY THE
GOVERNMENTS, CALLEJAS SAID.  "WE NEED MORE CONTACT AMONG THE PEOPLE IN
ALL WALKS OF LIFE, ON CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LEVELS, SO THAT
WE MAY CONTINUE IMPROVING THE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS
EXISTED BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES," HE POINTED OUT.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 6 FEB 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]
THIS MORNING PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HOSTED A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE
PRESIDENT'S PALACE OFFICE.  THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE HUMAN
RIGHTS SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY.  IN ADDITION, [WORDS INDISTINCT]
PRESENTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS RAPPORTEUR OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] [WORDS INDISTINCT] OF THE COMMISSION THAT HAS
ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IN 1989
THERE WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TERRORISM AND
[WORDS INDISTINCT].  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AND IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL AND
POLITICAL CASES, IT WAS DECIDED THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT CONTINUES
PROGRESSING, BUT THERE IS AN EVEN BETTER WAY YET.  THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS THAT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE MAKING
MORE PROGRESS EACH DAY AND BECOMING MORE OPERATIONAL.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE
BECOMING MORE COOPERATIVE EVERY DAY WITH THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM FOR LOCATING MISSING
PEOPLE.  WE HAVE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO LOCATE MANY MISSING
PEOPLE, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].

   FRANKLY SPEAKING, [NAME INDISTINCT] IS A SERIOUS MAN WHO DESERVES
ALL OF MY TRUST AND RESPECT FOR HIS CAPABILITIES.  HE HAS SAID THAT WE
HAVE PROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING SOME TERRORIST GROUPS, AND WHAT WE NEED
IS ASSISTANCE IN IMPROVING OUR EFFICIENCY.  HE HAS POINTED OUT SOME
DEFECTS IN OUR PENAL PROCEDURES WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO KEEP
THESE PEOPLE IN PRISON.

   HOWEVER, HIS CONCLUSIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE ARE
GETTING WORSE.  THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE NEWS.  HIS
CONCLUSIONS NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT HE HAD TO
MAKE AS UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER FOR GUATEMALA, THE SITUATION IN OUR
COUNTRY HAS OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED, COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS.  WE
ARE TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION.  THIS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN
A WRITTEN REPORT THAT WILL BE NOTED IN GENEVA IN ORDER TO CONSIDER
TREATMENT FOR GUATEMALA.  [CONTINUED]

   GUATEMALA CITY, 24 JAN 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] A
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL MISSION, MADE UP OF PROMINENT LEADERS OF THAT
ORGANIZATION, ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY ON 23 JANUARY TO "DEMAND" THAT
THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT CONDUCT AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
MURDER OF SALVADORAN OPPOSITION LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES AND
GUATEMALAN GILDA FLORES.  THEIR KIDNAPPING AND SUBSEQUENT MURDER TOOK
PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY AND THUS, GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES, WITHOUT ANY
KIND OF MEDDLING, SHOULD SOLVE THIS CASE.  GUATEMALAN COURTS OF
JUSTICE HAVE THE DUTY TO REQUEST, AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE
TESTIMONIES OF WITNESSES AND CONCLUSIONS OF EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE
CASE.  ACCORDING TO GUATEMALAN LAW, THERE IS A PERIOD ALLOTTED FOR
INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS DURING WHICH NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE
OR PRESSURES EXERTED WHICH MIGHT HAMPER THE COURSE OF JUSTICE.

   THIS IS WHY THE FACT THAT A DELEGATION, WHICH IS MADE UP OF
RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE OUR ADMIRATION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF
THEIR OUTSTANDING POLITICAL VIRTUES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THEIR HONEST
BEHAVIOR AS CITIZENS, IS COMING TO "DEMAND" THAT OUR AUTHORITIES
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME, AS IF THEY WERE NOT ALREADY OFFICIALLY DOING
SO, IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAMPERING JUSTICE.  IT HAPPENS THAT THE
ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS CAME HERE WITH THE EVIDENT GOAL OF ACCUSING THE
ALLEGED AUTHORS OF THE DOUBLE CRIME.  IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS, THEY HAVE
ALREADY SAID THAT "FORCES OF THE GUATEMALAN AND SALVADORAN EXTREME
RIGHT" MURDERED THEM.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE AS UNCALLED FOR AS THOSE
UTTERED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IN EL SALVADOR WHEN HE SAID THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE SIX UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] JESUITS
WERE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
GUERRILLAS AND WAS LATER FORCED TO RETRACT, WHEN THE INVESTIGATIONS
REVEALED THAT MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES CARRIED OUT THE
MURDER.

   IN THE FACE OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, AND THE
COMDEMNATION OF THE BRUTAL MURDER OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS,
PRESIDENT CEREZO DECIDED TO ESTABLISH AN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION TO
WHICH HE PLANS TO ADD A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATION.  ON 23 JANUARY THE SOCIALIST DELEGATE WHO IS IN THE
COUNTRY (WITHOUT NAMING IT) CLEARLY REFERRED TO A LEGALLY REGISTERED
GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTY, WHICH ENJOYS FULL POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS THE
"NANNY" PARTY OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA, OF EL
SALVADOR.  HE IS LEVELLING SERIOUS CHARGES, WHICH COULD EVEN CREATE
LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR, BY
INSISTING THAT THE CRIME WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, WHICH SEEMS TO BE
EVIDENT, AND BY LINKING THE CRIME TO POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE TWO
COUNTRIES.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION
DESERVES, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE CONSULTED ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE NEXT BECAUSE THE CASE IS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF
GUATEMALAN COURTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN JUTIAPA JURISDICTION.  THOSE
COURTS SHOULD BE THE ONES TASKED WITH COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE, ISSUING
THE SUMMONS, AND MAKING THE NECESSARY STATEMENTS.  ANYTHING ELSE
CONSTITUTES INTERFERING WITH JUSTICE.  IN THIS REGARD, THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT CEREZO IS GUESSING ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE AUTHOR OF THIS
REPUDIABLE BLOODY MURDER IS INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS NOT HIS DUTY
TO DO SO, EVEN IF THE SOCIALISTS THREATEN TO SEEK CONDEMNATION AGAINST
GUATEMALA AT THE UNITED NATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH
ARE LOOMING OVER HIS GOVERNMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE,
CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CATEGORICALLY DENIED
TODAY THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND
U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED THIS WEEK BY THE U.S. MEDIA.

   "I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.  OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL," PONCE SAID TO JOURNALISTS, ADDING, "THE U.S.
ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE
ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US."

   THE MILITARY OFFICER STATED: "THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO
FORCE OR BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES."

   REPORTS FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS SAID THAT THE ARREST OF EIGHT ARMY
MEMBERS LINKED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO
WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER HAS PROVOKED SERIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SOME
MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE U.S. ADVISER CORPS DETACHED TO THE
COUNTRY.

   PONCE PARTICIPATED ON WEDNESDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, IN THE CEREMONY TO
TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL TO COLONEL RICARDO CASANOVA,
REPLACING COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, ONE OF THE MEN INVOLVED IN THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS.

   PONCE REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME ARE
IMPRISONED AT THE NATIONAL POLICE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE AND ARE RECEIVING A SALARY WHILE THE COURTS
ISSUE A RULING ON THIS CASE.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 5 FEB 90 (LA PRENSA) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT]
DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR CONTINUISM,
DANIEL ORTEGA, HAS BEEN INSISTING ON HIS INTENTION OF A QUICK
RECONCILIATION WITH THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAYS SO
AMID SLANDER AND THREATS THAT INVALIDATE THE SINCERITY OF HIS REMARKS.

   FOR ORTEGA AND HIS SPOKESMEN, TO BE RESPECTED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND TO MANAGE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW
HIS PARTY'S "BEST GUARANTEE," THAT PARTY'S GREAT ELECTORAL OFFER.  THE
ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS INCOHERENT AND CONTRADICTORY
ATTITUDE IS AS A REELECTION STRATEGY, REALIZING THE POPULARITY OF THE
IDEA OF NORMALIZING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ORTEGA HAS NOT WANTED TO REMAIN DISTANCED FROM THAT ASPIRATION, WHICH
THE PEOPLE JUDGE AS INDISPENSABLE TO IMPROVE THE CRISIS THEY ARE IN.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY UNNECESSARY DISTANCING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SANDINISTS WAS DUE TO THE LATTER'S
INITIATIVE.

   EVERYONE KNOWS THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOTH MR BOWDLER AS WELL AS
LAWRENCE PEZULLO TO ATTAIN CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT THAT FOLLOWED SOMOZA DEBAYLE'S.  THE STRONG PRESSURES ON
THE DICTATOR TO RESIGN WERE DECISIVE IN HIS DEPARTURE.  THE CARTER
GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE AND EARLY AID WAS DECISIVE IN STABILIZING THE
REVOLUTIONARY REGIME.

   THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] NATIONAL
DIRECTORATE, HOWEVER, HAD OTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM HAVANA.  AS SOON AS
THEY GOT OUT OF THE AIRPLANE, THEY TOOK IT OUT ON THE "YANKEES, ENEMY
OF HUMANITY," WHICH WERE ONLY SEEKING AN UNPREJUDICED RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE NEW LEADERS.  THAT RHETORIC WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS OBVIOUS IF
IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THAT CONFRONTATION CAMPAIGN
WAS TO JUSTIFY ITS MISSION OF SETTING CENTRAL AMERICA ON FIRE AND THUS
DISTRACTING THE UNITED STATES WITH A STRATEGY OF DESTABILIZING THE
AREA, WHICH IS CONVENIENT TO USSR INTERESTS.

   THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GENERAL
STAFF MOVED TO NIACARAGUA, AND THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION
VENCEREMOS BEGAN BROADCASTING FROM MANAGUA WHILE THE WHOLE COUNTRY
BECAME A SANCTUARY FOR SALVADORAN TERRORISTS AND A LOGISTICS RESUPPLY
BASE.

   THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION MADE ONE LAST EFFORT AT MANZANILLO, BUT
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER TINOCO ONLY WENT TO READ A PREPARED TEXT,
USING THAT BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY AS A CENTER STAGE FOR PROPAGANDA AND
DISTURBANCE.

   MENAWHILE, THE SLOGAN "IF NICARAGUA WON, SO WILL EL SALVADOR,"
FLOODED RADIO STATIONS, BANNERS, WATCHWORDS, GRAFFITI, AND BOASTFUL
SPEECHES, WHILE THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY BANDS DID
LIKEWISE, DEVASTATING EL PETEN.

   DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE ENDERS CAME HIMSELF TO HOLD TALKS WITH
THE FSLN'S GENERAL DIRECTORATE, PROPOSING AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD
GUARANTEE STABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR MESSIAH-LIKE PROJECT OF
SUBVERTING THE REGION.

   WHEN THESE TALKS FAILED, WHAT FOLLOWED WAS INEVITABLE AND IS
REGRETTABLE.

   NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE SANDINISTS MAY TRY AFTER 10 YEARS TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME, TRYING TO PUT THINGS RIGHT, THE RECIPE CONTINUES TO BE
THE SAME: ONE, "GENUINELY FREE AND JUST" ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, AND
TWO, THE REMOVAL OF THEIR INCITING HANDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.  ON
THESE LINES, SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER'S DECLARATION LAST WEEK
WAS CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL: CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE
HONEST, "SOMETHING VERY HARD TO DETERMINE, UNLESS ORTEGA ALLOWS
CONGRESSINAL OBSERVERS," AND CONVICING PROOF THAT NICARAGUA HAS
STOPPED SENDING ARMS TO EL SALVADOR.  IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FRAUDULENT,
SENTENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED: "THE UNITED STATES COULD MAKE
NICARAGUA'S SITUATION TOUGHER."  IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WOULD CONFIRM
HIMSELF ONLY AS A GUARANTOR OF WAR AND MISERY.

CONTRERAS] [TEXT] PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET SAID HERE THAT THIS IS
THE LAST CITY HE WILL VISIT DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS NATIONWIDE
TOUR TO BID TAKE LEAVE OF THE CITIZENRY AS CHIEF OF STATE.  HE ALSO
THANKED THE CHILEAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR HARD WORK TO MAKE PROGRESS.

   THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE OPTIMISM AMONG THE
PEOPLE IN THE NORTHERN REGION AS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.  PINOCHET
SAID IN COPIAPO THAT THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES AND FORCES OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE.  HE MADE THESE
STATEMENTS DURING A PUBLIC CEREMONY AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATRE IN
COPIAPO, WHERE HE WAS HONORED FOR HIS GOVERNMENT WORK IN THE PAST 16
YEARS.  AFTER ENUMERATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE THIRD REGION, THE
PRESIDENT REFERRED TO HIS COMPLETED MISSION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PINOCHET] WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR MISSION BECAUSE WE
HAVE BEHAVED IN KEEPING WITH THE ARMED FORCES TRADITION.  WE
MAINTAINED THE HONOR WE INHERITED FROM OUR HISTORIC HEROES.  THOSE WHO
IGNORE THE GREAT WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE INSTITUTIONS
ARE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE WITH HISTORY.

   THOSE WHO TRY TO TARNISH THE HONOR OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FORCES
OF ORDER ARE AGAINST CHILE AND ITS ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS.  THIS IS
NOT ACCEPTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [APPLAUSE] [END RECORDING]

   BEFORE MEETING WITH THE COPIAPO CITIZENRY, THE PRESIDENT ALSO
REFERRED TO THE VIOLENT ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE IN SANTIAGO.  HE SAID
THAT THESE ATTACKS WILL NOT HINDER THE TALKS ON THE TRANSFER OF POWER.
HE ADDED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE FULL REPORTS ON THE SUBVERSIVE ATTACK.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PINOCHET] I THINK IT IS NORMAL, A SITUATION IN
KEEPING WITH THE DYNAMICS OF CURRENT POLITICS.  I DO NOT FORESEE
GREATER CONSEQUENCES TO IT.  WHEN I GET BACK THERE POSSIBLY [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT]

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THERE HAS BEEN A TERRORIST
ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

   [PINOCHET] I CANNOT TELL YOU, I HAVE BEEN TOLD OVER THE PHONE, BUT
IT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WHICH I CANNOT REPEAT, BUT I DO NOT
THINK IT IS TOO SERIOUS.

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THAT DOES NOT BREAK AWAY [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT].

   [PINOCHET] ACCORDING TO WHAT I KNOW SO FAR, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
THAT COULD TURN INTO ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS.  THINGS ARE GOING ALONG
JUST THE SAME, WITH THE SMALL PROBLEMS THAT ARISE DAILY WITHIN THE
DYNAMICS OF POLITICS, BUT AS I JUST SAID, I DO NOT THINK [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTACK WAS
COMMITTED BY THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM THE SANTIAGO PRISON?

   [PINOCHET] THAT IS WHAT I MEAN; I DO NOT THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
SINCE REACTIONS OF VIOLENCE HAVE INCREASED.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN THEM.
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I GOT, IT COULD BE SERIOUS BUT NOT AS
MUCH AS TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD. [END RECORDING]

   FINALLY, PRESIDENT PINOCHET SAID HE STILL HAD NO FURTHER REPORTS ON
THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN WHICH ANOTHER CARABINERO WAS SLAIN, AND HE
REGRETTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER]
WHICH WAS A SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATION WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE
TERRORIST CELLS.

   THE CHIEF OF STATE WILL END HIS TOUR OF NORTHERN CHILE IN SERENA.
HE WILL RETURN TO SANTIAGO TODAY.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COL. RENE EMILIO PONCE,
CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, SAID TODAY THAT
145 GUERRILLAS AND 53 SOLDIERS HAD BEEN KILLED IN 386 CLASHES IN
JANUARY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATION
"VICTORIA."

   COL. PONCE SAID THAT THE ARMY HAD DESTROYED 61 CAMPS AND THWARTED
48 LOGISTICAL GUERRILLA OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN JANUARY,
WHILE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SAID IT HAD
INFLICTED 532 ARMY CASUALTIES, INCLUDING 10 OFFICERS, IN ARMED
CONFRONTATIONS DURING THE MONTH.

   COL. PONCE HELD THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "MURDER"
OF 19 PEOPLE AND ADDED THAT 22 REBELS HAD DESERTED FROM THE FMLN
RANKS.  HE STATED THAT THE REBELS HAD CONDUCTED 235 SABOTAGE
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE TELEPHONE, ENERGY, AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,
AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE PROPERTY.

   OPERATION "VICTORIA," WHICH BEGAN IN JANUARY, WAS AIMED AT
ATTACKING THE GUERRILLA GROUPS THAT STAYED BEHIND IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF
SAN SALVADOR AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN CITIES AFTER THE REBEL OFFENSIVE
OF 11 NOVEMBER 1989.

   PONCE SAID THAT 45 PERCENT OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY (APPROXIMATELY
30,000 SOLDIERS) IS PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONWIDE OPERATION
"VICTORIA."

   THE ARMY CONFISCATED 186 WEAPONS OF VARIOUS CALIBERS DURING THE
CONFRONTATIONS IN JANUARY.

   PONCE ADDED THAT 1,980 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM YOUTHS, HAVE BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY THE REBELS SINCE 11 NOVEMBER AND ARE RECEIVING GUERRILLA
TRAINING IN CHALATENANGO, MORAZAN, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, IN THE LAST DECADE THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLA MOVEMENT HAS CAUSED ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE COUNTRY OF
APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION AS A RESULT OF TELECOMMUNICATION AND ENERGY
SABOTAGE OPERATIONS.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 10 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER
JULIO LONDONO PAREDES SAID TODAY THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO THINK OF SOME
IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS "WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THE
INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT COLLAPSES AND TARIFFS AND OBSTACLES ARE
RAISED AGAINST OUR NATIONS' EXPORT PRODUCTS."

   IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE VENEZUELAN DAILY NEWSPAPER
EL NACIONAL, LONDONO NOTED THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT SCHEDULED TO BE
HELD IN CARTAGENA NEXT WEEK IS IMPORTANT IN THAT THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY AND SEVERAL COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE
BEGUN TO REALIZE THAT "THE DRUG PROBLEM IS UNIVERSAL."

   "IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS DECLARING US
SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEMS ONLY FOUR YEARS
AGO, BE REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT AT A MEETING WITH HIS COLOMBIAN,
PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS, AND THUS PROPERLY ASSUME ITS ROLE
AS COPARTICIPANT AND A PARTY JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE IN THIS MATTER," HE
SAID.

   IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE
GOOD-NEIGHBOR COMMITTEES IN HIS COUNTRY AFTER HE STEPS DOWN DUE TO THE
CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IN COLOMBIA, LONDONO SAID:

   "THE COLOMBIAN COMMISSION -- AND I KNOW THE VENEZUELAN COMMISSION
TOO -- IS MULTIPARTISAN.  I KNOW IT INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
LIBERAL PARTY AND ITS VARIOUS FACTIONS, FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY,
AND ALSO FROM THE PATRIOTIC UNION.  IT IS A NATIONAL, NOT PARTISAN,
COMMISSION, AND THEREFORE, SINCE WE HAVE PRESENTED SOME ACHIEVEMENTS
TO THE TWO COUNTRIES, I AM CONVINCED THAT THE SAME POLICY WILL
CONTINUE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND
THEIR LEADERS."

   FOR HIS PART, VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER REINALDO FIGUEREDO
PLANCHART ASSERTED THAT THE PROBLEM OF DELIMITING SEA AND UNDERSEA
AREAS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES, IS
EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA, ALTHOUGH IT MUST NOT BE
FORGOTTEN THAT OTHER VERY IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE ALSO PENDING. "THERE
ARE MANY OTHER THINGS FOR WHICH THE COMMUNITIES AT THE BORDERS WANT
SOLUTIONS, AND THESE ARE THE MATERS WE ARE GOING TO ATTEND TO ON A
PRIORITY BASIS," HE SAID.

   WHEN ASKED IF THE DELIMITATION PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED DURING THE
ADMINISTRATIONS OF PRESIDENTS VIRGILIO BARCO (COLOMBIA) AND CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ (VENEZUELA), HE ASSERTED THAT "WE MUST NOT SET FIXED
DEADLINES ON MATTERS."

   THIS WEEK LONDONO AND FIGUEREDO TOURED THE EXTENSIVE FRONTIER
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND DIRECTLY LEARNED ABOUT THE SITUATION AT
THE COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN BORDER, WHERE SMUGGLING OF GOODS, DRUG
TRAFFICKING, AND KIDNAPPINGS PROLIFERATE.

BARCO VARGAS SAID HE WILL ASK U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH -- DURING THE
15 FEBRUARY DRUG SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN CARTAGENA -- FOR GREATER
ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA AND PERU, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PRODUCERS OF COCA
LEAVES.

   DURING AN INFORMAL TALK WITH NEWSMEN, BARCO SAID THAT AT THE SUMMIT
HE WILL ASK PRESIDENT BUSH TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE
TO FIGHT THE "WAR" HE HIMSELF DECLARED ON DRUG- TRAFFICKING MAFIAS
AFTER VARIOUS TERRORIST ACTIONS LAST AUGUST.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFY THE KIND OF AID OR HOW IT SHOULD BE
PROVIDED, BARCO VARGAS SAID THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HE WILL ASK FOR
WOULD CONCENTRATE ON A GREATER OPENING OF THE U.S. MARKET TO EXPORTS
FROM ANDEAN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY PRODUCTION AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING
OF COCAINE.

   IN ADDITION TO PRESIDENTS BUSH AND BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME
PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL ALSO ATTEND THE
SUMMIT.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PRESENT PROPOSALS ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF
OTHER CROPS FOR COCA LEAVES -- THE BASE FOR MAKING COCAINE -- WHILE
BEARING IN MIND THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF
PEASANTS ENGAGED IN THIS ACTIVITY.

   THE FOUR PRESIDENTS WILL MEET FOR NO LONGER THAN FIVE HOURS AND
WILL SIGN A DOCUMENT IN WHICH THEY WILL DEFINE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP
AN OVERALL STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL REPORTS, THE POINTS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED
IN THE JOINT DOCUMENT INCLUDE STRENGTHENING ANDEAN ECONOMIES BY
INCREASING EXPORTS, AND THE "TOTAL STRUGGLE" AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
DRUG-TRAFFICKING GANGS BY REDUCING DEMAND, CONSUMPTION, AND SUPPLY OF
HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS.

   BARCO VARGAS SAID INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS SHOULD "ESPECIALLY HELP
THE FRATERNAL COUNTRIES OF BOLIVIA AND PERU, WHICH HAVE GREAT NEEDS."

   ONE OF THE COLOMBIAN OBJECTIVES AT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT WILL BE TO
MAKE THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTAND ITS CORESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERIOUS
COCAINE-TRAFFICKING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF ITS ALMOST 14.5 MILLION DRUG
ADDICTS AND BECAUSE OF ITS SALES OF WEAPONS AND CHEMICAL COMPONENTS --
WHICH SEEM TO HAVE NO OFFICIAL CONTROL -- TO MAFIAS.

   AT LEAST 5,000 MEN FROM COLOMBIAN SECURITY CORPS ARE ALREADY
PATROLLING STRATEGIC SITES IN CARTAGENA TO PREVENT ANY ACT OF
TERRORISM THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED BY THE DRUG CARTELS DURING THE
SUMMIT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE DIRECTOR OF A
SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP HAS SAID THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE DOES NOT HELP ATTAIN PROGRESS IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN
EL SALVADOR "BECAUSE THE ARMY IS BEING BLACKMAILED WITH MILITARY AID."

   "LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE" DIRECTOR MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ HAS SAID
THAT FOR YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPORTED THE THESIS THAT THERE
HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR.

   DURING A MEETING WITH FOREIGN PRESS CORRESPONDENTS HERNANDEZ SAID:
"THAT IS A THESIS BASED ON ITS OWN PREMISES.  IT IS SELF-DECEIVING."

   DURING THE PAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS PROVIDED $4.5 BILLION
IN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH ALLOWED EL
SALVADOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INCREASE ITS ARMY FROM 12,000 TO
56,000 MEN.

   ACCORDING TO MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ, "THE ARMED FORCES ARE EVEN MORE
ARROGANT AND HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS"
UNDER THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) GOVERNMENT THAT TOOK
POWER LAST JUNE.

   SHE REPORTED THE REAPPEARANCE OF "DEATH SQUADS," AND MAINTAINED
THAT THOSE GROUPS WERE ALWAYS "INVOLVED" WITH THE MILITARY.

   "THERE HAS NEVER BEEN OR EVER WILL BE A DEATH SQUAD TOTALLY ALIEN
TO THE ARMY, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A POWER INDEPENDENT OF THE ARMED
FORCES," HERNANDEZ SAID.

   ACCORDING TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE STATISTICS CITED BY MARIA
JULIA HERNANDEZ, 218 PEOPLE WERE REPORTED MISSING IN 1989, AND 31
ASSASSINATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF PROMINENT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS,
WERE BLAMED ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] TODAY, 11
FEBRUARY, AT 0900, THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BEGAN BOMBING AND FIRING
ROCKETS AGAINST A SETTLEMENT OF REPATRIATES IN HUANCORA, SAN ISIDRO
LABRADOR JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, WITH TWO A-37 PLANES
AND FOUR HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, KILLING SIX PERSONS, WOUNDING THREE
OTHERS, AND DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES.  IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE
FMLN STATES:

   1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT
PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE
AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF
PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE
VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY.

   3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR
FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION [TO THE CONFLICT].  THE
PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE
NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.

   WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT
THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND
TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES DENIED TODAY THAT THEIR PLANES HAD BOMBED A REFUGEE CAMP AND
CIVILIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CHALATENANGO AND MORAZAN,
LOCATED NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR, AS RELIGIOUS SOURCES HAD
REPORTED YESTERDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES STATES THAT FIVE PERSONS,
INCLUDING FOUR MINORS, WERE KILLED, NOT AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS,
"BUT AS A RESULT OF THE CLASHES" BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS AT
THE "CORRAL DE LAS PIEDRAS" REFUGEE CAMP IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THE ARMED FORCES ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF FIRING ROCKETS "THAT HIT
SEVERAL HOUSES," AND IT REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER AND SIX GUERRILLAS
WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES, WHICH LASTED BETWEEN 0600 AND 1400.

   HOWEVER, EDUARDO ALAS, THE BISHOP OF CHALATENANGO, TOLD THE MEDIA
TODAY THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND AT LEAST 14 CIVILIANS WERE
WOUNDED WHEN THE CAMP WAS ATTACKED FROM THE AIR.

   "ACCORDING TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY," ALAS SAID, "A ROCKET OR A
GRENADE-TYPE DEVICE FELL ON ONE OF THE HOUSES WITH MANY PEOPLE INSIDE,
INCLUDING CHILDREN.  I SAW THE MUTILATED BODIES OF THE CHILDREN AND
HOLES IN THE ROOF.  THERE WAS A LOT OF MACHINEGUN FIRE."

   MOREOVER, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)
CONDEMNED THE "COWARDLY ATTACK" ON THE REFUGEE HOMES, WHICH, HE SAID,
WERE "HIGLY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIAN HOUSING."

   "THIS INCIDENT SHOWS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE ARMED FORCES
TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, AND IT REAFFIRMS THE NEED TO MAINTAIN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO USE MILITARY POWER TO REACH A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED," THE FMLN SAID IN A
COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY.

   THE FMLN ALSO CONDEMNED AN ALLEGED BOMBING OF THE TOWN OF
CACAOPERA, IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DENIED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED AND A SUGAR CANE
HARVEST WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMBS, BUT ACCORDING TO COL MAURICIO
VARGAS, MILITARY CHIEF OF THE REGION, "THERE WAS NO BOMBING, BUT
CLASHES WITH A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS WITH THE SUPPORT OF HELICOPTERS."

   THE MILITARY CHIEF PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO CARRY OUT THE "PERTINENT
INVESTIGATIONS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REGION."

DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS] HAS REVEALED A
TERRORIST PLAN THAT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, ELN, WAS PLANNING TO CARRY
OUT IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN COLOMBIA IN MARCH, AND ADDED THAT THIS
SUBVERSIVE GROUP IS DIVIDED BY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITS LEADERS.

   A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THIS SECURITY ORGANIZATION STATES THAT,
FOLLOWING AN EXHAUSTIVE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED
THAT THIS GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IS DIVIDED, BECAUSE AN ELN FACTION
REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE DECISIONS OF FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ
MARTINEZ.

   IT ALSO STATES THAT THE DISSIDENT GROUP HAS ACCUSED THE FORMER
SPANISH CLERGYMAN AND TOP ELN LEADER OF MONOPOLIZING ECONOMIC
RESOURCES, PREVENTING THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RANK AND FILE,
MAINTAINING A SECURITY GROUP MADE UP OF CRIMINALS, ASSUMING
PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES, AND USING THE MARXIST IDEOLOGY FOR HIS OWN
BENEFIT.

   THE REPORT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE INSURGENT ORGANIZATION WAS
PLANNING TO CARRY OUT A SO-CALLED KEY OPERATION IN NORTHERN AND
EASTERN COLOMBIA THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE KIDNAPPING OF
PERSONALITIES, THE OCCUPATION OF TOWNS, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF TOP
ARMED FORCES OFFICERS.

   MEANWHILE, TROOPS OF THE NATIONAL ARMY'S 5TH BRIGADE HAVE
INTENSIFIED SEARCH AND CONTROL OPERATIONS IN A RURAL AREA OF SAN
VICENTE DE CHUCURI MUNICIPALITY, MIDDLE MAGDALENA, SANTANDER
DEPARTMENT, AFTER KILLING SIX ELN SUBVERSIVES AND SEIZING ABUNDANT WAR
MATERIEL.

   ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE MINISTRY'S ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT, THERE
WAS A CLASH BETWEEN UNITS OF THE (LUCIANO DE LUGER) BATTALION AND
GUERRILLAS OF THE ELN'S CAPTAIN PARMENIO FRONT IN LA TEMPESTUOSA PATH,
SAN VICENTE DE CHUCURI MUNICIPALITY, SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.  SIX

HAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED ITS REGRET OVER THE DEATH OF SEVERAL CHILDREN
AND CIVILIANS IN THE GUANCORITA CANTON, CHALANTENGO DEPARTMENT, ON 11
FEBRUARY, AND HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THE CASE, WHICH
IS BEING BLAMED ON THE AIR FORCE.  THE MASSACRE TOOK PLACE AT A CAMP
OF SALVADORAN REFUGEES WHO HAD BEEN IN HONDURAS.  ACCORDING TO
RESIDENTS, SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS STRAFED THE CAMP FOLLOWING
A CLASH BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT.

   MEANWHILE, AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA DENIED
THE ACCUSATIONS BUT ADMITTED SOLDIERS BELONGING TO A DETACHMENT
STATIONED IN CHALANTENANGO HAD RECEIVED AIR SUPPORT. "THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE AIR FORCE IS EFFECTED ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS,
WHICH IS WHY IT COULD NOT HAVE BOMBED CIVILIANS," VILLAMARIONA SAID.

   IN THE WAKE OF THIS GRAVE INCIDENT, CHALANTENANGO DIOCESE BISHOP
MSGR. EDUARDO ALAS HELPED TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE WOUNDED AND HEARD
TESTIMONIES FROM RESIDENTS.  THEY SAID THAT THE HELICOPTERS HAD
DROPPED "ROCKETS," ACCORDING TO THE BISHOP.

   ON MONDAY, MILITARY SOURCES CONFIRMED HEAVY FIGHTING HAD TAKEN
PLACE IN THE AREA KNOWN AS CORRAL DE PIEDRA, GUANCORITA CANTON, SOME
80 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THAT SEVERAL CIVILIANS WERE KILLED
AND AT LEAST 15 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHTING.  MASS GROUPS HAVE
DEMANDED PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE, SINCE THE VICTIMS,
MOST OF THEM MINORS, WERE REPATRIATES FROM HONDURAS WHO HAD SETTLED
BETWEEN GUARJILA AND SAN JOSE LAS FLORES, WHICH IS WHERE THEY HAD COME
FROM.

   THE ARMY STATES THAT IT ALSO CAPTURED A REBEL IDENTIFIED AS ABEL
DUBON CHEVARRIA, WHO ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT DISCLOSED THAT
THE REBELS HAD USED THEIR CATAPULTS AGAINST THE HOUSES IN THE TOWN.

MARQUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, TODAY SAID IN
CARTAGENA DE INDIAS THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE "EXTRADITABLES," A
GROUP THAT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST GROUP OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE
COUNTRY, ARE WILLING, AS THEY HAVE CLAIMED, TO ACHIEVE PEACE.

   MAZA MARQUEZ, WHO ARRIVED IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS ALONG WITH
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO -- THE HOST OF THE DRUG "SUMMIT" THAT WILL BE
HELD IN THIS CITY ON COLOMBIA'S CARIBBEAN COAST -- ADDED THAT THE
PARTIAL TURNOVERS THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE MADE OF RAW MATERIALS
AND WEAPONS IN RECENT WEEKS "PROVE VERY LITTLE."

   ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN GENERAL, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "TURN OVER
ONE TON (OF DYNAMITE) BUT THEY HIDE SEVEN TONS."

   THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS),
THE SECRET POLICE AT THE SERVICE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MADE THIS
STATEMENT IN REGARD TO THE VOLUNTARY TURNOVERS MADE BY THE MEDELLIN
CARTEL, THE LARGEST COCAINE-EXPORTING GROUP IN THE WORLD.

   THE "EXTRADITABLES" BEGAN THEIR TURNOVERS DURING THE LAST WEEK OF
JANUARY, AFTER ANNOUNCING THEIR SURRENDER TO THE STATE, AS PROOF OF
THEIR "GOOD WILL" -- TO EARN THEM "LESS STRICT TREATMENT" BY COLOMBIAN
SOCIETY.

   TODAY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS "DELIVERED" THREE LABORATORIES, WITH A
CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING 20,000 KG PER MONTH, TO 25 COLOMBIAN
JOURNALISTS.

   THE FACILITIES, LOCATED IN THE CHOCO JUNGLE REGION ON THE
PANAMANIAN BORDER IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, HAVE BEEN TERMED BY THE
JOURNALISTS AS "THE BIGGEST" LABS AVAILABLE TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE TURNOVER WAS MINIMIZED BY THE DAS DIRECTOR, WHO
SAID THAT THESE PRODUCTION CENTERS "HAVE NOT BEEN USED FOR A LONG
TIME."

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE PRIOR TO THE MEETING BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENTS OF BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES, AND PERU, MIGUEL
MAZA MARQUEZ EMPHASIZED TODAY THAT THE COLOMBIAN STATE'S "GOAL" IS
STILL "TO CAPTURE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND TURN THEM OVER TO COLOMBIAN
JUSTICE."

   THE CHIEF OF THE SECRET POLICE INSISTED THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO
INDICATE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING A DIALOGUE OR REACHING
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NARCO-TERRORISTS.

   THE ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT WILL BE HELD TOMORROW IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS
WITH THE INTENTION OF COORDINATING JOINT POLICIES TO END THE
PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, AND EXPORT OF COCA LEAVES AND COCAINE IN LATIN
AMERICA.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL LAST ONLY FOUR HOURS, AND IT WILL
CONCLUDE WITH THE SIGNING OF A DOCUMENT THAT, JUDGING FROM THE DRAFT,
WILL STRENGTHEN MULTILATERAL RELATIONS TO COUNTER THE PRODUCTION,
EXPORT, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.

   LONDON (UK), 15 FEB 90 (LONDON PRESS ASSOCIATION) -- [ARTICLE] [TOM
MCMULLAN, PRESS ASSOCIATION DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT] [TEXT] BRITAIN
AND ARGENTINA TONIGHT AGREED TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WHICH
WERE BROKEN OFF IN 1982 AFTER THE INVASION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE TONIGHT IN LONDON, BUENOS AIRES AND MADRID,
WHERE TWO DAYS OF TALKS BETWEEN SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE HAMMERED OUT THE
DEAL.  THE FOREIGN OFFICE STRESSED THE DECISION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT
ON BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS, WHERE 1,000 BRITONS WERE
KILLED AND WOUNDED DURING THE WAR.

   BRITAIN HAS AGREED TO LIFT THE 150-MILE MILITARY PROTECTION ZONE
AROUND THE FALKLANDS FROM MARCH 31.  AT THE SAME TIME NEW MUTUALLY
AGREED SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL COME INTO FORCE.  THESE WILL INVOLVE
25 DAYS ADVANCE NOTIFICATION BY EACH SIDE OF MILITARY MANOEUVRES IN
CERTAIN AREAS.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN AGREED THERE SHOULD BE 48-HOURS
NOTICE FOR NAVAL SHIPS WHICH WANT TO APPROACH CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN
50 NAUTICAL MILES AND 70 NAUTICAL MILES FOR AIRCRAFT.

   FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL COME INTO FORCE AS SOON AS THE
PROTECTING POWERS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED.  BRITAIN'S
INTERESTS IN ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY SWITZERLAND SINCE
1982.  ARGENTINA'S INTERESTS IN LONDON HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY BRAZIL
FROM THE SAME PERIOD.

   TALKS ON FISHERIES AROUND THE FALKLANDS WILL CONTINUE.  A WORKING
GROUP ON SOUTH ATLANTIC AFFAIRS IS TO BE SET UP.  ITS FIRST MEETING
WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AN ARGENTINE VISIT TO WAR
CEMETERIES IN THE FALKLANDS WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD.  THIS WILL BE
WORKED OUT THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.

   BOTH SIDES HAVE ALSO AGREED THAT VISAS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE
ABOLISHED.  BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE ALSO AGREED TO COOPERATE ON
DRUGS AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

   THE BRITISH DELEGATION TO THE TALKS WAS LED BY SIR CRISPIN TICKELL,
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION BY SENOR
GARCIA DEL SOLAR, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM.

   THE AGREEMENT IS THE OUTCOME OF A SERIES OF CONTACTS BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  IN OCTOBER, IT WAS AGREED TO
ESTABLISH CONSULAR RELATIONS.  AIR LINKS BETWEEN BUENOS AIRES AND
LONDON RESUMED A FEW WEEKS AGO.  A PARTY OF BRITISH MPS AND PROMINENT
PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM BUENOS AIRES AFTER THE
INAUGURAL FLIGHT BY BRITISH AIRWAYS.  AN OBSTACLE TO THE RESUMPTION OF
RELATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS THE ARGENTINE REFUSAL TO DECLARE
THAT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE AT AN END.  HOWEVER,
THE NEWLY-ELECTED ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MADE CLEAR LAST YEAR THAT SUCH
HOSTILITIES COULD NOW BE CONSIDERED AT AN END.  BRITAIN, AFTER TALKS
LAST OCTOBER, AGREED TO RAISE NO OBSTACLES TO ARGENTINE EFFORTS TO
ESTABLISH CLOSER TRADING RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE
ARGENTINE ECONOMY IS NOW SEEN TO BE IN A SEVERE PLIGHT.  PRESIDENT
MENEM HAS WATCHED HIS POPULARITY DECLINE AS ARGENTINA INFLATION HAS
REMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL.

   BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A DIRECT COMMUNICATION
LINK BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  THE PURPOSE IS TO
REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCIDENTS AND TO LIMIT THEIR CONSEQUENCES IF
SUCH INCIDENTS SHOULD OCCUR.  ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THIS HOTLINE
WILL INCREASE COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH
ATLANTIC.  THE LINK WILL BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ARGENTINE AND
BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTRIES.  BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT
ADEQUATE DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE FALKLANDS.

   FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER TIMOTHY SAINSBURY RETURNED TO LONDON LAST
WEEKEND AFTER A VISIT TO THE FALKLANDS WHERE HE REASSURED ISLANDERS
THERE WAS NO WEAKENING IN BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO THEIR DEFENCE.

   FOREIGN SECRETARY DOUGLAS HURD TONIGHT DESCRIBED THE AGREEMENT WITH
ARGENTINA AS "VERY SATISFACTORY" AND THAT IT "UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT
WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH ARGENTINA".  HE SAID: "THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF SOVEREIGNTY.  I HOPE IT IS A TURNING POINT
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA."
MR HURD TOLD REPORTERS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE: "I HOPE THAT TRADE
BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA CAN BE ACCELERATED.  IT IS FOR THE
FALKLAND ISLANDERS TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN CONTACTS WITH THE MAINLAND."

   ASKED IF THE INSTABILITY IN ARGENTINA MIGHT LEAD TO A NEW ATTEMPT
TO SEIZE THE FALKLANDS, HE SAID: "I THINK THAT IS BECOMING LESS AND
LESS LIKELY."  HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION THAT THE READINESS OF THE
GOVERNMENT IN ARGENTINA TO MAKE THIS ADVANCE WHICH BRITAIN HAD
RECIPROCATED.  "THE OUTCOME IS VERY SATISFACTORY," HE SAID.  THE
BRITISH PROTECTION ZONE HAD BEEN REPLACED "WITH SOMETHING FROM A
SECURITY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS BETTER.  WE HAVE REPLACED IT WITH AN
ADVANCE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ON THE APPROACH OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT.
THAT FROM A SECURITY VIEWPOINT IS AN IMPROVEMENT."  HE HOPED THAT THE
AGREEMENT WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN THE FALKLANDS AND NOTED THAT THE
FALKLAND ISLANDERS HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AN ASSURANCE OF BRITAIN'S
CONTINUED COMMITMENT.

   THE EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS AND THE ENDING OF VISAS WOULD TAKE
PLACE QUITE SOON.

   ASKED IF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS COULD EVER BE DISCUSSED WITH
ARGENTINA HE SAID: "I DO NOT SEE HOW THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED BY US GIVEN
THE HISTORY AND PRINCIPLE THAT IS INVOLVED."

   LABOUR WELCOMED THE MOVE TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  MR
GEORGE FOULKES, A FRONT BENCH SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SAID IT
MEANT THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE NOW ALMOST BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
POSITIONS BEFORE THE 1982 CONFLICT.  BUT HE ADDED: "WE MUST NOW PULL
OUT ALL THE STOPS IN DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES."  THIS INCLUDED CONSIDERING ALL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH
INVESTMENT IN ARGENTINA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL, SPORTING AND
OTHER LINKS.

   LA PAZ, 9 FEB 90 (PRESENCIA) -- [ARTICLE] [GREGORIO LANZA] [TEXT]
THE SANTA CRUZ PREPARATORY MEETING WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY
MEASURES AND ITS CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN KEPT UNDER STRICT SECRECY.
THIS VEIL OF SECRECY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LIFTED WHEN THE MORNING
NEWSPAPER HOY PUBLISHED A LONG AGENDA UNDER THE HEADING "TOTAL WAR
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING."  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NEITHER
CONFIRMED NOR REJECTED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT.  (SILENCE IS
GOLDEN).  AT A MEETING AT THE INTERIOR MINISTER'S OFFICE ON 31
JANUARY, THE MINISTER TOLD COCA PRODUCERS THAT HOY DID NOT REPORT THE
PRELIMINARY AGENDA...  AND THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CRITERION OF "COCA IN
RETURN FOR DEVELOPMENT" HAS PREVAILED.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, AND IF
THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THIS POSITION, WHY HASN'T THE COUNTRY BEEN
INFORMED?

   THE SITUATION HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE REMARKS BY
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, WHO SAID THAT "WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED
TO HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON" ONE OF THE COUNTRIES INTRODUCED CHANGES THAT
HAVE "CHANGED THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE ISSUE."  WHAT IS THIS NEW
CONCEPT?  IS IT ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY OR INDEPENDENCE?

   THE PROGOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA HAS MONOTONOUSLY REITERATED OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS THAT TO GOVERN MEANS TO INFORM.  FINE.  WE AGREE THAT TO
INFORM IS PART OF THE ART OF GOVERNING.  TO INFORM, HOWEVER, ALSO
MEANS TO TELL THE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IF IT DEALS WITH AN ISSUE THAT IS
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF BOLIVIANS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CONSISTENT, AT LEAST WITH THIS PRINCIPLE.

   PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA HAS REPEATEDLY PROPOSED THE REPLACEMENT
OF COCA PRODUCTION THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  YET THE REMARKS BY
U.S. EMBASSY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARILYN MCAFEE HAVE DEALT AN
ANTICIPATED BLOW THAT HAS CAUSED SOME OFFICIALS TO HESITATE.  "THERE
IS $15 MILLION FOR REPLACEMENT," SHE SAID.  (THERE IS $60 MILLION FOR
REPRESSION).  BARELY RECUPERATED FROM HIS SURPRISE, THE FOREIGN
MINISTER SAID THAT THE U.S. HELP IS A "BILATERAL ISSUE AND,
CONSEQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED" AT THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT.  THE INTERIOR MINISTER, WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE
OF SITUATION, DID NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MCAFEE'S STATEMENT AND
STRESSED THAT "MORE EXACT FIGURES WILL BE MENTIONED AT THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT."  WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?  WILL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT ADDRESS
THE ECONOMIC AID?

   AFTER THIS PECULIAR SITUATION, THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO HAVE
CHOSEN INTERDICTION AND ERADICATION -- REPRESSION -- TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  THE STRATEGY OF "WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING
TERRORISTS" HAS PREVAILED.  THIS STRATEGY LENDS ITSELF TO
INTERVENTIONIST MILITARY POLICIES, SIMILAR TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S.
MARINES IN BOLIVIA IN THE PAST, OR, IN THE FUTURE, THE CREATION OF A
MULTINATIONAL MILITARY FORCE THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE REGIONAL POLITICAL
AND MILITARY STABILITY.

   WHEN THE TRAFFICKING OF COCAINE WAS CARRIED OUT AS A COVERT
OPERATION (1984-87) INVOLVING THE CIA AND THE U.S. ARMY -- FOR THE
PURPOSE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE CONTRAS -- COCAINE
TRAFFICKING WAS NOT A CRIME.  THE LINKS BETWEEN NORIEGA AND DRUG
TRAFFICKING WERE A MATTER OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE AS LONG AS HE
PROVIDED INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA.  BUT
NOW THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT MIND INVADING PANAMA OR TURNING
COLOMBIA INTO AN INFERNO TO CAPTURE NORIEGA OR SOME OF THE MAJOR
COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS ON THIS CRUSADE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT
IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-FACED MORALITY.

   ANOTHER SCANDAL HIT U.S. SOCIETY LAST WEEK.  MARION BARRY, THE
MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, THE CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE AND ALSO THE CAPITAL OF
CRIME, WAS CAUGHT IN AN FBI TRAP.  HE WAS FILMED CONSUMING COCAINE.
HIS FOLLOWERS CLAIM THAT IT IS A WHITE CONSPIRACY TO PREVENT A BLACK
MAYOR FROM RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TERM.

   BUT THE INTERESTING POINT FOR US IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
BENNETT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STRATEGIST FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING (THE BENNETT PLAN), AND WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF FULWOOD.
WHILE BENNETT HAS QUESTIONED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE,
CLAIMING THAT THIS AREA RECEIVES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT
FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FULWOOD HAS SAID THAT
BENNETT IS WASTING TIME "TALKING WITHOUT DOING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING"
(NEWSWEEK, 29 JANUARY).  THE NEWSWEEK JOURNALIST SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE
THE BARRY SCANDAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE BENNETT PLAN HAD
BECOME "ONLY A DIRTY BATTLE OF WORDS."  BENNETT'S STRATEGY FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
A TOTAL FAILURE.  BENNETT THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO
COVER HIS FAILURE IS TO TURN TOWARD LATIN AMERICA TO RELIEVE THE FURY
OF HIS IMPOTENCE, ORDERING WARSHIPS AND PLANES TO CONTROL MARITIME AND
AIR TRAFFIC.  AS USUAL, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE "BACKYARD" HAVE TO
PAY FOR THE MISTAKES OF U.S. POLICY.

   THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUSPENSE.  THE SUSPENSE HAS BEEN CREATED BY
THE ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO KNOW THE
CONCLUSIONS OF THE SANTA CRUZ SUMMIT.  OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE TO
ACCEPT THAT A SMOKE SCREEN HAS BEEN DEPLOYED OVER THE CARTAGENA
SUMMIT.

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] THE
DEBT AND ITS INTEREST HAVE STEADILY GROWN, BUT THE VALUE OF OUR
PRODUCTION HAS DECREASED, SO IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PAY THE DEBT.  THEREFORE, WE ARE FACED WITH THE SAME OLD STORY: LEND
ME 100 MILLION AND I WILL PAY YOU 110 MILLION AND STILL OWE YOU 120
MILLION WITH THE NEW INTEREST.  THIS ROTATION OF CREDIT DOES NOT
PRODUCE ANY MATERIAL ASSETS LIKE RAW MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY PLANTS DID
IN THE PAST.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THIS RELATION IS NO LONGER FEASIBLE; IT IS USELESS.
WE HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POOR, AND WE OWE MORE AND MORE.  WHY NOT
CHANGE TO MORE RATIONAL RELATIONS LIKE IS BEING DONE BY CIVILIZED
PERSONS WHO KNOW HOW TALK MULTILATERALLY?  WE WOULD THUS ELIMINATE THE
FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, WHICH NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO PAY AND,
CONSEQUENTLY, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT.  THAT IS WHAT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT.

   FINANCIAL CAPITALISM NO LONGER PRODUCES MATERIAL ASSETS AND DOES
NOT GENERATE ANYTHING -- BUT IT CERTAINLY CONTINUES TO IMPOVERISH US
-- SO AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL FORCE IS ACCUMULATING IN
THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, AND JAPAN.  THEY HAVE NO ONE TO SELL IT TO
BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POOR.  SUDDENLY THEY HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THEY ARE THERE, FULL OF ILLUSIONS
ABOUT CREATING NEW MARKETS IN THAT AREA -- AND THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT LATIN AMERICA, WHICH PURCHASED MACHINERY FROM THE UNITED STATES
AND EUROPE FOR 50 YEARS.

   I THINK THAT IS UNJUST AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS A WHOLE.  THE
UNITED STATES HAS... CHANGES THOUGHT WHAT MORE DOES IT WANT, IF IT HAS
THE RESOURCES THAT IT NO LONGER SPENDS ON ATOMIC BOMBS OR ON MEN AND
WEAPONS IN EUROPE?  IT HAS TO INVEST THOSE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY MAY
YIELD SOMETHING.  WHERE?  IN POLAND?  IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA?  WHY?  WHY
NOT IN LATIN AMERICA?  WE ARE HERE AND WE HAVE COMMON PROBLEMS LIKE
DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.

   [AMAT] WHAT ARE PERU'S REVENUES, IN DOLLARS, FOR THE COCA CROPS?

   [GARCIA] THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS APPROXIMATELY $700
MILLION.

   [AMAT] WITH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO REPLACE THAT $700 MILLION IF THE
COCA CROPS ARE ABOLISHED?

   [GARCIA] THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHY WE CAME TO
TALK.  IT IS OBVIOUS, IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE AN ETHICAL AND MORAL
OBLIGATION TO END IT, BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT I HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE
PEASANTS' COCA CROPS TO ACHIEVE THIS.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT ABOUT THE PEASANTS OF PERU AND BOLIVIA?
COLOMBIA'S CASE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE COCA IS PROCESSED HERE.  WOULD
THE PEASANTS BE WILLING TO CHANGE THOSE CROPS FOR OTHERS?

   [GARCIA] IF THEY ARE GIVEN A LONG-TERM GUARANTEE, YES.

   [AMAT] BUT WOULD THEY CHANGE COCA FOR TOMATOES, ORANGES, AND CACAO?

   [GARCIA] IT IS NOT EASY TO CHANGE IT FOR COFFEE, TOBACCO, CACAO,
ANNATTO, OR PALM TREES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STUDIED ALL THIS.
I HAVE A 600-PAGE REPORT FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT DISCUSSES THE
ALTERNATIVES FOR REPLACING THE 80,000 HECTARES IN THE GUAYAGA VALLEY
-- WHICH IS THE LARGEST COCA-PRODUCING AREA IN THE COUNTRY.  IT
WOULD COST $600 MILLION TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE AREA ON A LONG-TERM
BASIS.

   [AMAT] BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, COCA PRACTICALLY GROWS WILD; IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE MUCH WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HOW CAN A GOVERNMENT LIKE YOURS
CONVINCE A FARMER TO INVEST MUCH MORE MONEY IN A PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE
MUCH LESS PROFITABLE?

   [REPORTER] LET ME ADD SOMETHING TO THAT...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] EXCUSE ME.  IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE.  THE
PEASANT PRODUCES COCA BECAUSE HE HAS NO MONEY.  I WILL NOT ASK HIM TO
INVEST MONEY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE PRODUCT.  THE UNITED
STATES HAS TO BUY THE NEW PRODUCT TO ACHIEVE THIS.  THE UNITED STATES
HAS TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BUY THE PRODUCT.  LOOK, HOW MANY
TRILLIONS DOES THE UNITED STATES BUY AS IMPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES? A
FRACTION OF THIS WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINY OF COLOMBIA, PERU, AND
BOLIVIA.

   THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SAY: IF I BUY $600 BILLION IN PRODUCTS
ABROAD, I WILL BUY $10 BILLION -- OF ANYTHING -- IN PERU, COLOMBIA,
AND BOLIVIA.  IT COULD BE TOMATOES, PALM OIL, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE BARS,
ANYTHING.  THIS WOULD CHANGE THE HISTORY OF THESE COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] I
HAVE SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF MY POLITICAL LIFE SAYING THINGS
CLEARLY.  MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBE THAT ATTITUDE AS VEHEMENCE OR
RADICALISM.  I DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW.

   WHEN THE UNITED STATES INVADED PANAMA -- AND I WAS AWARE OF WHAT
NORIEGA WAS -- I SAID THAT DESPITE THAT FACT, THE INVASION HAD BEEN A
CRIME.  WE DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS.  I
SAID THAT IF THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL DID NOT TAKE PLACE, I WOULD NOT
ATTEND THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT, BECAUSE I COULD NOT SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT WHILE A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY REMAINED
INVADED.  AND IT HAPPENED.  IT HAPPENED.  THE TROOPS HAD TO WITHDRAW.
AND WE HAVE HELD A CORDIAL MEETING FOR THAT REASON.

   [AMAT] MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE CONVINCED US [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THINGS THE WAY YOU SEE AND FEEL ABOUT THEM.  WILL YOU TELL US FRANKLY
-- FRANKLY -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE SUMMIT?  WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE SUMMIT?  WHAT IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED AT THE SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] FRANKLY, AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE.  IT CREATED A
MULTILATERAL ATMOSPHERE, AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY.  AS FOR ME
PERSONALLY, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET A CONTINENTAL POLITICIAN
LIKE BUSH, AND I FOUND HIM TO BE A PRAGMATIC PERSON.  I PROBABLY
DISAGREE WITH HIM ON MORE THAN HALF OF THE THINGS HE THINKS, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE OBLIGED TO BE IDENTICAL. WHAT IS
IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT EACH PERSON FOR HIS GOOD POINTS -- HOWEVER FEW
OR MANY THEY MAY BE -- TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT ON THAT BASIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS BEING PLANNED?  WHAT IS NEXT?  WHAT IS GOING TO
BE DONE TO CONTINUE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] IN ORDER FOR THE PRESIDENTS
TO KEEP IN CONSTANT TOUCH TO FULFILL WHAT THEY SIGNED?

   [GARCIA] WELL, THERE WILL BE CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.  IT IS EASY TO
TALK WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT, WHO IS NOT GOD.  THERE ARE TELEPHONES TO
DO THAT.  MR. BELL INVENTED A LITTLE GADGET OVER A CENTURY AGO CALLED
THE TELEPHONE AND WE, THE PRESIDENTS, COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER --
WITH BARCO, PAZ ZAMORA, AND PRESIDENT BUSH, TO ASK: WILL WE OR WILL WE
NOT DO WHAT WE PLEDGED TO DO?  IF WE DO NOT, AT LEAST IT WILL NOT BE
MY FAULT OR THAT OF THE LATIN AMERICANS.

   [AMAT] WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, AND
THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT IS ALSO FACING AN ELECTORAL PROCESS...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] AND YOU KNOW THE CANDIDATE, FORTUNATELY.
[CHUCKLES]

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO
DEFEAT YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY?

   [GARCIA] IT IS A POSSIBILITY, IT IS TRUE.

   [AMAT] WHY?

   [GARCIA] LOOK, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO YOUR QUESTION WOULD THINK THAT
FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASSUMED POWER, PERU WAS A COUNTRY FULL OF GOLD,
VERY RICH, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE SPANISH CONQUEST -- ORDERLY, AND
WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  FIVE YEARS AGO IT HAD A DEVELOPED TERRORIST
PROBLEM.  IT HAD A FOREIGN DEBT OF 14.5 BILLION AND WAS EXTREMELY
POOR.  FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED.  I EXPLAINED TO YOU ONCE
 THAT I TRIED TO MAKE IT GROW AT GREAT SPEED AND MANAGED TO DO SO.
THEN WE FACED A DECLINE, AND WE ARE NOW STABILIZING THE SITUATION.

   HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT A PERSON CAN SOLVE MANY THINGS
BECAUSE OF THE IMPETUOSITY IN HIS PERSONALITY.  SOMETIMES THIS IS THE
PROBLEM OF BEING HONEST OR HAVING AN IMPETUOUS PERSONALITY OR
HARBORING MANY HOPES -- OR SELLING THEM.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT -- LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO -- WE HAVE A POOR COUNTRY,
A COUNTRY THAT OWES MONEY, A COUNTRY THAT HAS JUST AS MUCH OR MORE
SUBVERSIVE TERRORISM, AND THIS MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.  I CANNOT
UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER, THAT IS WHAT WE POLITICIANS ARE FOR -- TO
BURN OUT IN OUR WORK FOR DEMOCRACY TO SURVIVE.  I WILL BE REPLACED BY
SOMEONE ELSE WHO THINKS LIKE ME OR TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ME.  HE WILL
REPLACE ME AND DEMOCRACY WILL STAY, A CIVILIZED SYSTEM. THIS IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING.  [CONTINUED]

SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT EARLY THIS MORNING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, SET ON FIRE TWO COTTON PROCESSING
PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL, SOME 142 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR, CAUSING GREAT
PROPERTY DAMAGE, ACCORDING TO MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOURCES.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, FMLN MEMBERS ATTACKED THE "CANESSA" AND "EL
OBRAJUELO" COTTON PLANTS IN SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, DESTROYING HEAVY
EQUIPMENT, WAREHOUSES WHERE HUNDREDS OF QUINTALES OF COTTON WERE
STORED, AND THE MAIN BUILDINGS.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS HURT.

   SPOKESMEN REPRESENTING THE OWNERS REPORTED MUCH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND
NOTED THAT THE INCIDENT IS PART OF THE FMLN'S CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE
AGAINST THE ECONOMY.

   HEAVY CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE
COUNTRY'S NORTHEASTERN REGION, DURING WHICH AT LEAST TWO SOLDIERS WERE
KILLED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE HAS NOT REPORTED
THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING.

   SEVERAL TOWNS IN EASTERN EL SALVADOR ARE WITHOUT POWER SINCE 14
FEBRUARY DUE TO SABOTAGE ACTIONS.  ELECTRICITY IS ALSO BEING RATIONED
IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF SAN SALVADOR, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF FIVE
HIGH TENSION LINES, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   HOWEVER, BOMB ATTACKS ON SHOPPING CENTERS IN SAN SALVADOR ARE LESS
FREQUENT.  RECENT ATTACKS HAD CAUSED GREAT CONCERN AND PROMPTED A
STRONG PROTEST FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES OF EL

A FEW HOURS AFTER LEARNING OF A NEW GUERRILLA ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT
DAYBREAK ON 7 FEBRUARY, AGAINST THE TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO POLICE GARRISON.
THE GUERRILLAS STOLE FOUR .38 CALIBER REVOLVERS, FOUR M-1 CARBINES, AND .30
CALIBER AMMUNITION AND TOOK POLICE PATROL CAR NO.  CH-02.

   DURING WEDNESDAY'S NEWS CONFERENCE, THE ARMY RELEASED A SUMMARY OF
GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES STARTING IN EARLY DECEMBER, WHEN SUBVERISVE
COMMANDOS DESTROYED THE BRIDGE SPANNING THE COYOLATE RIVER.  DURING A
FOUR-DAY PERIOD IN DECEMBER, THE GUERRILLAS SABOTAGED AN ELECTRICAL
TOWER OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AND SET FIRE TO A VEHICLE BELONGING TO THE
TECHNICAL-AGRICULTURAL TRAINING INSTITUTE ON THE ROAD TO SOLOLA.

   TWO MORE ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS TOOK
PLACE THE FIRST WEEK IN JANUARY.  A FEW DAYS LATER, THREE
GOVERNMENT-OWNED VEHICLES WERE SET ON FIRE -- ONE BELONGING TO BANDESA
[NATIONAL AGRICULRURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK] AND TWO BELONGING TO THE
PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTRY, WHICH WERE TRANSPORTING VACCINES TO A CLINIC.
DURING THE LAST DAYS OF JANUARY, THERE WAS ANOTHER ACT OF SABOTAGE
AGAINST THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN QUEZALTENANGO AND AN ATTACK ON THE
VILLAGE OF POCHUTA THAT CAUSED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SINCE THE WEEKEND, A POST AT THE KILOMETER 42 ROAD MARK ALONG ROUTE
CA-9 WAS ATTACKED AND A CIVILIAN WAS KILLED.  AT DAYBREAK ON 14
FEBRUARY, THE NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON AT TECPAN, CHIMALTENANGO WAS
ATTACKED, BUT NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' NEW
DIRECTIVES CAME FROM A RECENT MEETING HELD IN A CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRY, WHICH THE MILITARY COMMANDER DID NOT IDENTIFY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GRAMAJO] THEY ASK ME [WORDS INDISTINCT]
INTERNATIONALISTS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED INFORMATION THAT A MEETING WAS
HELD IN ONE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN OCTOBER 1989.  NORTH
VIETNAMESE ADVISERS -- ONE OF THEM IS NOW A VIETNAMESE GENERAL, BUT
THE MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY VIETNAMESE AND CUBAN GENERALS BASICALLY --
MET WITH SUBVERSIVE LEADERS AND DISCUSSED THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN AREA UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION THEY ARE SUFFERING.
THUS THEY DECIDED ON A DESPERATE PLAN WHERE THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S
WAR WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON TAKING TO ITS OWN AND ONLY COMING TO TOWNS
TO MAKE ITS [WORD INDISTINCT].  EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD GET THE

PURE TERRORISM BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND ALSO

PANAMA

   IN HIS "LIGHTING" COLUMN, LUIS ARDINES STATES THAT "I DO BELIEVE
THAT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA WILL YIELD VERY POSITIVE RESULTS.
THE MAIN COCAINE PRODUCERS (COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU) AND THE
UNITED STATES, WHICH IS THE MAIN CONSUMER, WILL HAVE TO REACH AN
AGREEMENT THAT WILL GIVE US HOPE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ERRADICATE THE
SCOURGE OF DRUGS, WHICH IS KILLING THE YOUTH OF THE CONTINENT."

PERU

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW AFTER THE
SUMMIT THAT "I AM SATISFIED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL STATEMENT OF THE
DECLARATION OF CARTAGENA.  I HOPE IT BECOMES REALITY AND THAT THERE IS
SERIOUSNESS IN THE APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES TO REPLACE AND LIMIT
DRUG TRAFFICKING."

   WHEN ASKED TO SUMMARIZE THE SUMMIT'S RESULTS, HE SAYS: "FRANKLY,
AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE.  IT CREATED A MULTILATERAL
ATMOSPHERE AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY." IN CONCLUSION, HE SAYS THAT
COLOMBIANS "MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH
THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING."

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA DURING A VISIT TO SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIA
TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR, SAYS THAT THE MEETING IN
CARTAGENA "OPENS DOORS TO MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS INSTEAD OF THE
BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE POWERFUL UTILIZED TO DIVIDE LATIN
AMERICA."

   VENEZUELAN TELEVISION CARRIES A VIDEO REPORT REVIEWING THE SUMMIT
AND ITS RESULTS, HIGHLIGHTING THAT IT ENDED "WITH A POSITIVE RESULT,"
NAMELY "THE JOINT DECLARATION SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENTS" TO "FIGHT
TOGETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING TRADE" AND THE UNITED STATES' PLEDGE TO
"PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO REPLACE THE COCA CROPS."  THE VIDEO REPORT

BETANCUR EMPHASIZED THAT "THE UNITED STATES SELLS THE CHEMICAL
COMPONENTS NEEDED TO PROCESS" THE COCAINE, NOT TO MENTION THAT THIS
COUNTRY "IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DRUG CONSUMER" IN THE WORLD.  

COLOMBIA

   FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT BELISATIO BETANCUR PARTICIPATED IN A
LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRATIZATION SYMPOSIUM HELD IN CARACAS AND TERMED AS
"POSITIVE" THE CARTAGENA DRUG SUMMIT, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE "IT
RESULTED IN SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS" WHICH "HAVE FILLED OUR COUNTRIES
WITH HOPE."

   DIEGO GARCIA, PRESIDENT OF THE ANDEAN LAWYERS COMMISSION, TERMED
THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT AS "RHETORICAL AND INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT WAS
CENTERED ON REPRESSION RATHER THAN STRUCTURAL CHANGES," ADDING THAT
THE AMOUNT PLEDGED BY THE UNITED STATES FOR THE ANTI-DRUG STRUGGLE WAS
"VERY LITTLE."  GARCIA ADDED THAT "THE IDEA IS NOT FOR DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO GIVE MONEY" TO LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, BECAUSE THE IDEAL
THING WOULD BE TO "ESTABLISH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC RELATIONS, REDUCE
TAXES, GIVE PREFERENCE" TO LATIN AMERICAN PRODUCTS, AND "DEFINE THE
QUOTA SYSTEM."

   "WE KNOW," PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID, "THAT THE FMLN HAS ASKED FOR
TWO WEEKS TO STUDY AND RESPOND TO OUR LATEST PROPOSAL."

   THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO AN ATTACK LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS
MORNING ON AN ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATION IN NORTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR,
DESCRIBING IT AS "A PUBLICITY PLOY TO IMPRESS THE UN SECRETARY
GENERAL."

   "WE ARE INSISTING ON A HALT TO HOSTILITIES" BECAUSE OF SUCH
ACTIONS, WHICH "CONSTITUTE ONLY TERRORISM AND DO NOT REPRESENT A
MILITARY THREAT," THE PRESIDENT SAID.

   THE PRESIDENT DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC
AID IN OTHER REGIONS BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF FRG AID AND BECAUSE
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF U.S. AID CUTS.

   "THIS VISIT TO TAIWAN HAD BEEN SCHEDULED SINCE BEFORE THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER.  I RECEIVED THE INVITATION FROM THE TAIWAN
GOVERNMENT WHEN I TOOK OFFICE IN JUNE," CRISTIANI SAID.

   HE ADDED THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT IS TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS
AND TRADE WITH A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS TO EXPRESS THANKS FOR
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TAIWAN HAS PROVIDED.

   REGARDING AID FROM THE FRG, HE SAID "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO
REESTABLISH IT.  THE FRG GOVERNMENT IS CONDITIONING ITS AID ON RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE
COUNTRY."

   REFERRING TO U.S. AID, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAID HE IS NOT
AWARE THAT OFFICIAL DECISIONS OR PLANS EXIST.  INSTEAD, THERE ARE
PERSONAL POSITIONS OF CONGRESSMEN OR SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS, BUT THIS
MUST BE FULLY DISCUSSED AT THE TIME OF THE VOTE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL
YEAR, WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINS IN OCTOBER.

   THE PRESIDENT ALSO DEFENDED THE RECENT ECONOMIC MEASURES, WHICH
HAVE LED TO PROTESTS AGAINST THE GENERAL INCREASE IN PRICES OF
STAPLES.  HE SAID THESE MEASURES WERE NECESSARY FOR THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY, WHICH WAS AFFECTED LAST YEAR, FIRST, BY THE OVERALL CUTS IN
U.S. AID TO THE REGION, A REDUCTION OF $55 MILLION FOR EL SALVADOR;
SECOND, BY THE DROP IN INTERNATIONAL COFFEE PRICES, WHICH CAUSED $150
MILLION IN LOSSES FOR EL SALVADOR; AND THIRD, BY THE DAMAGE FROM THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER.

   BEFORE LEAVING ON HIS TRIP AND IN RESPONSE TO NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS,
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO DEFENDED THE ARMED FORCES, STATING THAT THE
ACTIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED RECENTLY HAVE NOT WEAKENED
THEM AND, ON THE CONTRARY, HAVE STRENGTHENED THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE
ERRORS HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE BEING PROSECUTED,
SUCH AS IN THE CASES OF THE JESUITS AND THE CIVILIANS WHO WERE KILLED
ON 11 FEBRUARY IN CHALATENANGO.

   CRISTIANI SAID THAT IN THE LATTER CASE THERE HAVE BEEN NO PRESSURES
AND THAT FROM THE MOMENT THAT THERE WAS NEWS ABOUT THE TRAGEDY, THE
COMMISSION THAT INVESTIGATES CRIMINAL ACTS WAS ORDERED TO UNDERTAKE
THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY.
HE SAID IT CONCLUDED THAT THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A HELICOPTER
ROCKET, BUT THERE WAS NO BOMBING, ALTHOUGH THE CIVILIANS WERE VICTIMS
OF WAR ACTIONS.

   CRISTIANI CRITICIZED THE FMLN FOR WAGING BATTLES IN POPULATED AREAS
BECAUSE THIS ENDANGERS CIVILIANS.

   IN CONCLUSION, CRISTIANI SAID THE FMLN WILL NEVER GIVE UP ITS
ATTEMPTS TO WEAKEN OR DIVIDE THE ARMED FORCES, BUT HE ADDED THAT THE
ARMED FORCES ARE BECOMING MORE PROFESSIONAL EVERY DAY.  


DEV-MUC3-1124 (UNISYS)

   BOGOTA, 18 FEB 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED
FORCES OF COLOMBIA'S (FARC) GENERAL STAFF STATED THAT ALL THE
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS AGREE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHOULD
SERVE AS MEDIATOR IN A BROAD PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS.

   THE FARC'S STATEMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY THAT
WAS SENT TO CARDINAL ALFONSO LOPEZ TRUJILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS RESPOND TO RECENT
STATEMENTS BY THE PRELATE, INTERPRETED BY THE FARC AS A MEDIATION
OFFER.

   ALTHOUGH THE DECLARATION IS ONLY SIGNED BY THE FARC COMMANDERS, IN
CERTAIN PARAGRAPHS THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AS IF THEY WERE SPEAKING
FOR THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD, FOUNDED IN
SEPTEMBER 1987.

   IN ADDITION TO THE FARC, THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING
BOARD IS MADE UP OF THE PRO-MAO POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL), THE
PRO-CASTRO CAMILISTA UNION OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (UC-ELN), THE
PRO-TROTSKY REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS' PARTY (PRT), AND THE INDIAN GROUP
QUINTIN LAME.

   THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), WHICH HAS A LEFTIST - NATIONALIST
ORIENTATION AND WHICH WAS PART OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA
COORDINATING BOARD, BEGAN 16 MONTHS AGO, OF ITS OWN ACCORD, A PEACE
PROCESS WITH VIRGILIO BARCO'S LIBERAL PARTY GOVERNMENT.

   THIS PEACE PLAN, WHICH HAS STUMBLED ACROSS SEVERAL POLITICAL
OBSTACLES THAT HAS PRECLUDED TOTAL COMPLIANCE, COULD END ON 28
FEBRUARY WITH THE M-19 HANDING OVER THEIR WEAPONS TO A SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL (IS) COMMISSION, THE FINAL PHASE BEING POSTPONED ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS SINCE LAST DECEMBER.

   "YOUR RECENT STATEMENTS, CARDINAL, ON OPENING NEW ROADS TOWARD
PEACE SEEM IMPORTANT TO US," THE FARC COMMANDERS STATE IN THEIR LETTER
TO CARDINAL LOPEZ TRUJILLO.

   "YOUR EMINENCE SAYS THAT IT WOULD MEAN GREAT PROGRESS FOR THE
COUNTRY IF THE FARC WERE TO TAKE PART IN A COHERENT PEACE PROCESS,"
THE NOTE GOES ON, ADDING: "YOUR EMINENCE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT EVER SINCE BELISARIO BETANCUR'S (FORMER
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT) AMNESTY, WHICH STOPPED A 25-YEAR WAR."

   IN 1984, UNDER BELISARIO BETANCUR'S SOCIAL - CONSERVATIVE
GOVERNMENT (1982 - 1986), A PEACE PROCESS BEGAN THAT RESULTED IN THE
CREATION OF THE LEGAL LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) MOVEMENT --
INITIALLY COMPRISED OF FORMER FARC GUERRILLAS -- AND AN AGREEMENT
RENDERING THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S GENERAL STAFF CAMP INVIOLABLE.

   THE FARC LEADERS SAY IN THEIR LETTER TO THE CARDINAL THAT THE BARCO
GOVERNMENT "DID NOT WANT OR COULD NOT CONTINUE BETANCUR'S POLICY OF
PEACE AND RECONCILIATION."

   "IF THE COLOMBIAN CHURCH, JUDGING BY THE CARDINAL'S STATEMENTS,
SERVES AS AN ITERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS, WE
APPLAUD THAT HUMANISTIC AND PATRIOTIC DECISION," THE FARC GENERAL
STAFF'S LETTER SAYS.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE YESTERDAY PROPOSING THAT
THE BARCO GOVERNMENT DECLARE A GENERAL CEASE-FIRE FOR THE 11 MARCH
LEGISLATIVE AND 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
HAS NOT YET RESPONDED.

   HOWEVER, WITH PREVIOUS REQUESTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS LIMITED ITSELF
TO ASKING THE GUERRILLAS FOR UNILATERAL TRUCES TO PROVE THEIR DESIRE
FOR PEACE, WHICH HAS ONLY WORKED OUT IN THE CASE OF THE M-19.

   ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD,
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UC-ELN, DECLARED UNILATERAL TRUCES DURING
THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

   THE PRO-CASTRO GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE A
SABOTAGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ELECTIONS, CHARACTERIZED BY KIDNAPPINGS,
ATTACKS ON RURAL VILLAGES, THREATS TO OFFICIALS, AND POLICE AND ARMY
AMBUSHES.

   LIMA, 18 FEB 90 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPT] PERU HAS FACED THE GREAT ADVERSITY OF
FOREIGN IMPERIALISM.  PERU, A POOR AND WEAK BUT SOVEREIGN COUNTRY, HAS
RAISED ITS VOICE TO FACE THE POWER AND GREED OF THE INTERNATIONAL
BANKING SECTORS. PERU AND THE PERUVIAN STATE HAVE REFUSED TO PAY AN
UNJUST DEBT.  THIS WILL BE FOREVER REGARDED AS THE PIONEER AND
VANGUARD ATTITUDE OF THE THIRD WORLD.

   NO ONE WILL EVER FORGET THAT, IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF MY
ADMINISTRATION, THE PERUVIAN RESOURCES THAT WERE SCHEDULED TO BE USED
TO PAY THE FOREIGN DEBT WERE INSTEAD USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF PERU. ALL
PERUVIANS ADMITTED AT THE TIME THAT WE HAD BEGUN A PROCESS OF
CAPITALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT.

   I HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO DELIVER SOME TRACTORS.  BUT I WANT TO
TELL YOU THAT DURING THE APRA [AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY
ALLIANCE] ADMINISTRATION THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS HAS DOUBLED.  WHEN THE
APRA ASSUMED POWER IN 1985, THERE WERE 5,060 TRACTORS IN PERU.  BUT
AFTER I DELIVER THESE ITALIAN TRACTORS, THERE WILL BE 11,200.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF LAND BEING FARMED MECHANICALLY IN PERU HAS
DOUBLED.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN"

   THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN
EQUIPMENT OPERATING IN PERU TODAY IS THE SAME MONEY THAT, IN A
SOVEREIGN DECISION, THE FATHERLAND REFUSED TO SEND ABROAD TO FOREIGN
INTERNATIONAL BANKS.  SHOUTS OF "WELL DONE" THE ANTI-IMPERIALISTIC
IDEAL THAT WE UPHOLD IS BASED ON THIS MAIN PRINCIPLE: TO RETAIN OUR
RESOURCES WITHIN PERU.

   WE HAVE ALSO RAISED OUR VOICES TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND
INTEGRITY OF OUR CONTINENT, BECAUSE WE ARE A PROUD AND FREE CONTINENT.
WHEN WE SAW MILITARISTIC IMPERIALISM THREATEN AND INVADE A BROTHER
COUNTRY, WE HAD THE HONOR -- THE SAD HONOR -- OF BEING THE ONLY ONE TO
RAISE ITS VOICE AND TO MAKE IMPERIALISM, DUE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE
PERUVIAN STANCE, HEED OUR DEMANDS AND WITHDRAW ITS INVADING TROOPS
FROM PANAMA."

   I REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF 20 DECEMBER 1989, WHEN AT 0500 GMT I WAS
INFORMED FROM WASHINGTON THAT 24,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD OCCUPIED
PANAMA. I RECEIVED MANY PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME: IT IS A
DONE DEED.  LET THEM INVADE THE COUNTRY.  WE DO NOT NEED TO CONFRONT
THEM.  I RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN PERU AND ABROAD TELLING
ME THAT WE COULD NOT CONFRONT THEM, THAT WE COULD NOT MAKE ANY
DEMANDS.  THEY SAID FOR US TO ACT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.  LET US
RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE PUT IN POWER.  BUT I SAID NO.
PEOPLE SHOUT "WELL DONE" I WAS TOLD: IF YOU KEEP SILENT, YOU CAN SOLVE
YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE IMF. BUT I SAID NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF A
NATION IS NOT FOR SALE.  NO, BECAUSE THE DIGNITY OF LATIN AMERICA
CANNOT BE BOUGHT.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS OF "ALAN, ALAN"

   CAUSING FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE IN PERU AND
THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA, I SAID: WE ARE POOR. WE HAVE NO GREAT
MILITARY POWER. WE HAVE NO PLANES OR BOMBS.  WE HAVE NO BANKS FILLED
 WITH MILLIONS.  BUT WE HAVE THE POWER OF REASON, WHICH IS MORE
POWERFUL.  WE HAVE THE POWER OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS GREATER.  WE HAVE
THE POWER OF FREEDOM, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT.  I SAID THAT WE WOULD
RECALL THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR FROM WASHINGTON.  WE WOULD WITHDRAW       
FROM THE MILITARY ALLIANCE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES,
WHICH ALLOWED IT TO PERPETRATE THIS INVASION. WE WOULD TELL THE
UNITED STATES THAT UNTIL THE LAST SOLDIER WAS WITHDRAWN, WE WOULD
NOT SIT AT ANY NEGOTIATING TABLE, NOT ON DRUGS OR ON ANY OTHER
SUBJECT.

   BUT THE PERUVIAN RIGHTIST SECTORS DESCRIBED EVERYTHING I SAID ON 21
DECEMBER, EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE PANAMANIAN INVASION, AS INSANE.  THEY
DESCRIBED IT AS DEMAGOGIC THEATRICS.  THEY SAID WE SHOULD COMPLY WITH
THE U.S. ACTIONS.  BUT I SAID NO. ALTHOUGH WE RESPECT THE UNITED
STATES AND ITS PEOPLE, WE DO NOT TOLERATE IMPERIALISTIC IMPOSITIONS.
WE DO NOT TOLERATE OTHER COUNTRIES INTERVENING IN THE SOVEREIGN
AFFAIRS OF SISTER-NATIONS.

   I CAN STATE WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT, 24 HOURS BEFORE THE
CARTAGENA SUMMIT AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE INVASION, THE LAST U.S.
SOLDIER WITHDREW FROM PANAMA.  THIS WAS THE SINE QUA NON CONDITION FOR
MY ATTENDANCE AT THE SUMMIT.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS

   THIS PROVES THAT YOU CAN BE POOR AND ECONOMICALLY WEAK, BUT THAT
YOU CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM REASON, FROM MORAL
PRINCIPLES; THAT YOU CAN HAVE JUSTICE ON YOUR SIDE; THAT YOU CAN
SUCCEED, THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  PERHAPS JUSTICE
MAY COME LATE, BUT IT COMES.  WHEN I SEE THE OLIGARCHIC ATTACK OF THE
PREPOTENT ECONOMIC POWER HITTING PERU, I TELL THE PEOPLE THAT THE
RIGHTIST SECTORS MAY BE VICTORIOUS. BUT IT WILL BE AN EPHEMERAL,
TEMPORARY, AND MOMENTARY VICTORY BECAUSE IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL
SUCCEED, THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CONQUER, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT,
THE PEOPLE HAVE JUSTICE ON THEIR SIDE, AND BECAUSE PERU BELONGS TO THE
PEOPLE.  APPLAUSE, CHEERS [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 18 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP
ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS DEPLORED YESTERDAY THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED RECENTLY "BECAUSE THEY WILL AFFECT POOR
SECTORS ONLY," AND INSISTED ON THE NEED TO END THE WAR.

   RECALLING FROM THE CATHEDRAL'S PULPIT THE PROMISE PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI MADE IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH THAT HE WOULD "STRUGGLE FOR THE
POOREST OF THE POOR," MONSIGNOR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THE MECHANISMS
USED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT THE MOST ADEQUATE ONES TO RESOLVE THE
SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR.

   "IF WE WANT TO HELP THE POOREST AMONG THE POOR, WE MUST NOT ONLY
HONESTLY AND OBJECTIVELY EXAMINE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT MODEL, BUT
SEEK A DEFINITIVE SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF WAR," THE PRELATE
EXCLAIMED.

   THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN EL SALVADOR
SAID THAT, IN EXAMINING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION, "THE
TERRORIST ACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CANNOT BE IGNORED."

   RIVERA Y DAMAS WARNED: "IF WAR CONTINUES TO BE WAGED IN THE
COUNTRY, IT WILL CONTINUE TO STRIKE AT US MERCILESSLY AND INHUMANLY,
HOUR AFTER HOUR."

   THE SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOP REITERATED THAT THE "ONLY WAY OUT" OF THE
ARMED CONFLICT IS DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, BECAUSE "VIOLENCE BEGETS
ONLY VIOLENCE."

   HE ALSO SAID: "THE BLOOD SHED IN THE WEE HOURS OF 16 NOVEMBER BY
THE JESUIT CHURCHMEN WHO WERE BRUTALLY MOWED DOWN IS WORKING FOR THE
POOR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THEIR ACADEMIC AND THEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES
SERVING THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION."

   HE WAS REFERRING TO THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE
KILLED BY MILITARY MEN, NOW UNDER TRIAL.

THREE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE CENTERS WOUNDING FIVE POLICEMEN.

   SIMILARLY, TWO BOMB ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS AND CENTRAL
DE LOS LLANOS ORIENTALES OIL PIPELINES CONDUCTED BY ELN REBELS HAVE
RESULTED IN PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE MILLIONS.  THE TWO ATTACKS OCCURRED
IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF NORTHERN SANTANDER AND META, RESPECTIVELY.

   TWO REBELS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND FOUR OTHERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED

   SANTIAGO, 5 FEB 90 (HOY) -- [ARTICLE] [GILBERTO VILLARROEL] [TEXT]
ON THE EVENING OF 20 MAY 1986, THE JENKA, A DANISH CARGO SHIP WITH AN
EMPTY HOLD, WAS ANCHORED IN VALPARAISO BAY.

   THE SHIP, WHICH WAS SPECIALLY FITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS, HAD BEEN
"WAITING INTO LINE" FOR 120 DAYS, MEANING -- IN PORT OPERATION JARGON
-- THAT IT WAS WAITING FOR ITS TURN OR FOR THE ARRIVAL OF ITS CARGO.

   THE FIVE-MAN CREW WAS UNEASY. THEY WERE WAITING FOR A SHIPMENT OF
400 "WASP" CLUSTER BOMBS PRODUCED BY FERRIMAR [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] -- A
SUBSIDIARY OF FAMAE (ARMY ORDNANCE) -- AND BOUND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE DESTINATION OF THE SHIPMENT WAS IRAN. THE USERS: THE ARMED FORCES
OF IMAM RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI.

   THE SECRET SHIPMENT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS ON LAND.

   THE FIVE CREW MEMBERS MADE A DECISION THAT NIGHT, TAKING ON FUEL
AND FOOD AND FLEEING TOWARD PANAMA. IN THE DARK NO ONE NOTICED THE
SHIP'S DEPARTURE, NOT THE SHIPPING COMPANY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE
SHIP NOR THE PORT'S CAPTAIN -- A NAVY OFFICER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO
AUTHORIZE THE MOVE. THE JENKA LEFT AN UNPAID DEBT OF $30,000 OWED TO
THE SHIPPING COMPANY.

   THE CASE WAS REPORTED BY THE PRESS AND FERRIMAR RUSHED TO SAY THAT
IT WAS SELLING WEAPONS TO PAKISTAN AND NIGERIA. IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT, FOR ETHICAL REASONS, WOULD NOT ALLOW THE ENTERPRISE TO
OFFER THE "WASP" BOMBS TO IRAN. IN FACT, CHILEAN BUSINESSMAN CARLOS
CARDOEN WAS ALREADY SELLING "CLUSTERS" [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH] TO
IRAQ. DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TWO SIDES CONFRONTING EACH
OTHER IN THE LONG PERSIAN GULF WAR WAS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.

   THE DEAL, HOWEVER, WAS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS. COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND THE USSR WERE KNOWN
TO BE SELLING WEAPONS TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THE USSR WAS DIRECTLY
SELLING WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND SUPPLYING IRAN THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. CHILE
KNEW OF A SIMILAR EXAMPLE: DURING THE BEAGLE CHANNEL CONFLICT, WHICH
ALMOST ENDED IN A WAR WITH ARGENTINA, ISRAEL SOLD MISSILES TO BOTH
SIDES.

   THEREFORE, IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED OPERATION, FERRIMAR AND FAMAE
WERE ABLE TO SELL CLUSTER BOMBS TO IRAN.

   THE MIDDLEMAN WOULD BE FRENCHMAN BERNARD STROIAZZO, THE SAME PERSON
WHO THREE YEARS LATER WOULD CAUSE THE "IRAN-CORFO" [PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION] SCANDAL (HOY, NO. 655).

   IT IS ONLY NOW THAT STROIAZZO'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AN
ENGINEER HIRED BY IRAN'S NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, HE SERVED AS A
REPRESENTATIVE OF FERRIMAR AND FAMAE TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE
SALE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN 1986. AFTER TWO SHIPMENTS OF DEFECTIVE BOMBS,
THE IRANIANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD CAUSE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG THEIR
OWN MEN THAN AMONG ENEMY TROOPS. STROIAZZO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE FOR 18
MONTHS.

   HE MANAGED TO LEAVE AND TRAVELED TO CHILE. WITH THE HELP OF CNI
[NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER] DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL HUGO SALAS,
HE CONTACTED CORFO OFFICIALS WHO HELPED HIM ARRANGE COMPENSATION. HE
ARRANGED A PRELIMINARY ACCORD FOR ESTABLISHING A TOXIC WASTE RECYCLING
PLANT IN CHILE, BUT THE DEAL FAILED. HE THEN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST
CORFO IN THE 19TH CIVIL COURT OF SANTIAGO.  CORFO HAS NOT YET BEEN
NOTIFIED OF THE LAWSUIT. THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE TOXIC
WASTE PLANT IS CONCERNED, WILL BE INHERITED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT --
WHICH WILL TAKE OVER ON 11 MARCH -- AND BY CORFO.

   DID FERRIMAR LIE TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT?

   THIS ENTERPRISE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE
AUTHORITIES. AMONG THE PARTNERS OF FERRIMAR OWNER ALDO PESCE WERE
RETIRED GENERAL MANUEL CONTRERAS SEPULVEDA, FORMER CHIEF OF THE
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, DINA; GENERAL RAUL REYES, FAMAE
DIRECTOR, AND COLONEL CARLOS CARRENO, WHO WAS A FAMAE EXECUTIVE AND AN
ADVISER TO FERRIMAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE "WASP" BOMBS. (A LAWSUIT
FILED WITH THE 14TH CRIMINAL COURT OF SANTIAGO UNDER "ROBBERY OF
INDUSTRIAL SECRETS" CHARGES CLAIMS THAT THE BOMBS WERE BUILT WITH
PLANS STOLEN FROM CARLOS CARDOEN BY ONE OF CARDOEN'S TRUSTED MEN.)

   TO EXPORT ITS BOMBS, FERRIMAR NEEDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
DEFENSE AND FOREIGN MINISTRIES. THE COMPANY HAD TO PROVIDE WHAT IS
KNOWN IN THE INTERNATIONAL WEAPONS MARKET IS KNOWN AS AN "END-USER
CERTIFICATE" OR "FINAL-USER CERTIFICATE." FERRIMAR GOT ONE. IT WAS
SIGNED IN AUGUST 1985 BY A NIGERIAN ARMY OFFICER WHO, ACCORDING TO
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE CASE, HAD RETIRED A LONG TIME AGO. A "TRIANGLE
OPERATION" WAS CARRIED OUT TO CONCEAL THE TRUE OPERATION. IT IS NOT
KNOWN WHETHER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HAS INDICTED ANYONE OVER THE
DECEPTION BY WHICH IT WAS VICTIMIZED.

   AT THE END OF JANUARY 1986, THE FIRST 100 BOMBS WERE SHIPPED BY
PLANE TO BANDAR ABBAS AIRPORT IN IRAN. EACH BOMB WEIGHED 227 KG AND
CONTAINED 248 AMMUNITION PACKAGES, SOME OF THEM FOR IMMEDIATE
DISCHARGE AND OTHERS FOR DELAYED ACTION.  THESE WERE CAPABLE OF MINING
LARGE AREAS FOR UP TO 72 HOURS AFTER A BATTLE.

   THE FIRST SHIPMENT WAS WORTH $7 MILLION; $1 MILLION WAS FOR
STROIAZZO AND $1.5 MILLION WENT FOR THE COST OF THE BOMBS. THE PRICE
OF THE BOMBS ABROAD WAS $14,000 EACH, BUT THEIR REAL COST WAS ONLY
$3,000. THE CHILEAN CONTACT IN THIS OPERATION, FERNANDO PEREZ, WAS TO
HAVE RECEIVED $4.5 MILLION.

   A TEST WAS PERFORMED IN IRAN AND THE BOMBS DID NOT WORK. THE
IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ASKED THAT NEW TESTS BE CARRIED OUT IN CHILE.

   BOGOTA, 20 FEB 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] U.S. AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA
THOMAS MCNAMARA HAS BEEN DECLARED A PRIORITY "MILITARY TARGET" OF THE
MARXIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLA GROUP, THE ELN
ANNOUNCED TODAY IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO EFE IN BOGOTA.

   THE COMMUNIQUE WAS DELIVERED IN THE MIDST OF AN ELN OFFENSIVE THAT
HAS LASTED FOR OVER THREE WEEKS.  IT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY
KIDNAPPINGS, ATTACKS ON TOWNS, MOBILE ROADBLOCKS ON THE MAIN HIGHWAYS,
AND AMBUSHES SET FOR MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA GROUP, THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK IS TO
PROTEST U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA, TO SABOTAGE THE MUNICIPAL AND
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 11 MARCH, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS ON 27 MAY, AND TO DENOUNCE THE "DIRTY WAR."

   IN TODAY'S MESSAGE THE ELN LISTS "AMBASSADOR THOMAS MCNAMARA" AS A
"PRIORITY" MILITARY OBJECTIVE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST.  IT ADDED THAT
OTHER TARGETS ARE "U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS," "U.S. CITIZENS WHO HEAD
THE MULTINATIONAL TEXAS AND OCCIDENTAL OIL COMPANIES," AND "ALL
AMERICANS WHO INTERVENE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN OUR NATION'S INTERNAL
CONFLICT."

   THIS PRO-CASTRO GUERRILLA GROUP IS HOLDING U.S. CITIZENS DAVID
LESLIE KENT AND JAMES ARTHUR DONELLY, WHO WERE KIDNAPPED IN MEDELLIN
ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY, TO PROTEST U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT

THE "DRUG SUMMIT."

   U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO AMICO FERRARI, KIDNAPPED ON 15 FEBRUARY IN
CALI, WAS RELEASED ON 19 FEBRUARY BY THE ELN WITH A MESSAGE ABOUT
"OPERATION COLOMBIA," WHICH DENOUNCES U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE "DIRTY
WAR" WITH WHICH COLOMBIA IS AFFLICTED.

   IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE THE GUERRILLAS SAY "THE UNITED STATES HAS
MILITARY ADVISERS IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS TO DIRECT THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRTY WAR."

   THEY ALSO DENOUNCE "THE DIRECT LEADERSHIP OF U.S. ADVISERS IN
INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY REPRESSION OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS OF
CONFLICT."

   THE ELN IS ALSO STILL HOLDING SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE SENATOR JORGE
SEDANO GONZALEZ, KIDNAPPED ON 9 FEBRUARY NEAR BUCARAMANGA, IN THE
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH HIS SECRETARY JORGE MESA,
WHO WAS RELEASED ON MONDAY.

   THE ELN RELEASED MESA WITH A MESSAGE FOR FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA (1970-1974), REITERATING THAT SEDANO WILL BE
RELEASED ONLY IF HE DECLARES THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO THE DIRTY WAR AND
REVEALS THE WHEREABOUTS OF FERNANDO PORRAS, AN ELN MEMBER WHO
DISAPPEARED IN BUCARAMANGA ON 5 FEBRUARY.  ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS, PORRAS WAS ARRESTED AND "DISAPPEARED" BY THE 5TH ARMY
BRIGADE, WHICH DENIES THIS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS PERSISTED IN
THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  THE FIVE OTHER REBEL GROUPS HAVE DECLARED
UNILATERAL TRUCES TO GUARANTEE A CLIMATE OF PEACE FOR THE UPCOMING
ELECTIONS.

   THESE GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA, THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, THE TROTSKYIST
[REVOLUTIONARY] WORKERS PARTY, AND THE INDIAN "QUINTIN LAME" MOVEMENT,
IN ADDITION TO THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT, WHICH IS ABOUT TO CONCLUDE A

   "WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT EVEN IF THE UNO [NATIONAL
OPPOSITION UNION] WINS, WAITING FOR PROFOUND DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND AN
END TO THE REPRESSIVE REGIME IMPOSED BY THE SANDINISTS," SAID THE
CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE (RN).

   THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF
ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE
POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD
HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED.

   NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO.

   THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS
TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE.

   "IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE
IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND
REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS,"
GALEANO SAID.

   "IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A
SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF
RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE," HE ADDED.

   THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT "IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A
SANDINIST VICTORY, "WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING."

   HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN
THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.

   GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY
30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO
"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY
300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING.

   GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE
ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE
DEPLOYED.

   "EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS
FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES," HE SAID.

   GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND
BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, "NOT MOVING,BUT
JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS" IN NICARAGUA.

   THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL
PRAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE
ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

   "THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING
CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN
CIVIC LIFE," HE ADDED.

   GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT "DEPEND OF
A SIMPLE ELECTIONS," BUT RATHER ON "THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER
COMPLETELY."

   THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT "WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN
THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED.  THERE
STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED
BY THE SANDINISTS."

   HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY
ELECTIONS, "WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION.  THE
NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE
THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS.
THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR
OWN WEAPONS."

   THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN
NICARAGUA.

   FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE
TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT.

   HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT "ANY OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND
SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA."

   HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN
YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS.

   "IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE
(FOR NICARAGUA), BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES," HE ADDED.

   THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT
ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVORS ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA.

   HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT
DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THIS IS A FAIT
ACCOMPLI.  


DEV-MUC3-1134 (UNISYS)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 18 FEB 90 (PRAVDA) -- [ARTICLE] [PAVEL BOGOMOLOV]
[TEXT] THE ANNALS OF THE COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA LIST THREE
EXTREMELY FIERCE SIEGES.  BACK IN 1586, THE "JEWEL OF THE CARIBBEAN"
WAS CAPTURED BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, WHO DID NOT BURN THE CITY TO THE
GROUND ONLY BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A RANSOM OF 10 MILLION PESOS.  A
CENTURY LATER CARTAGENA WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH.  FINALLY, IN 1741,
THE CITY'S DEFENDERS SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT OFF AN ASSAULT BY A HOST OF
27,000 PIRATES HEADED BY SIR EDWARD VERNON...

   THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBED THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF
THE UNITED STATES, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU HELD A FEW DAYS AGO IN
CARTAGENA AS A KIND OF ASSAULT.  DESPITE SOME EXAGGERATION, THIS
GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION WAS BASED ON PERFECTLY SERIOUS GROUNDS.  AFTER
ALL, THE CONFERENCE DID DISCUSS IMMEDIATE TASKS AND EVEN A DETAILED
SCHEDULE FOR A JOINT OFFENSIVE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES
AGAINST CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE PECKING
ORDER OF CRIME.

   IT IS INDEED NECESSARY TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT AGAINST THE DRUG
MAFIA'S STRONGHOLDS, WHETHER IN MEDELLIN, "FAMOUS" FOR UNBRIDLED
GANGSTERISM, OR IN CARTAGENA ITSELF, WHOSE STATUS AS A RESORT IS
THREATENED BY THE SELFSAME "COCAINE BARONS."  AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THIS TOURIST CENTER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE
EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS IN THE "HILTON" HOTEL, IN
STORES, OR AT ITS MARINAS.  IT IS NO WONDER, AS REUTER REPORTS, THAT
NOT A SINGLE CRUISE SHIP HAS DROPPED ANCHOR THERE THIS SEASON.

   YES, THE SITUATION IS HIGHLY ALARMING, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE
WHOLE OF COLOMBIA AND EVEN TO THE ENTIRE REGION.  IN THESE CONDITIONS
THE FIRM RESOLVE DISPLAYED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CARTAGENA
MEETING DESERVES UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT: THE RESOLVE TO FINALLY
POOL THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND TO
JOINTLY PLACE A RELIABLE BARRIER IN ITS PATH.  THESE ARE THE
INTENTIONS SHOWN IN THE JOINT STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS
AND BY THE SERIES OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.

   THE AIM OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS NOBLE INDEED: TO BESIEGE THE DRUG
MAFIA IN ITS NESTS, TO CUT OFF THE "LAUNDERING" OF DRUG DOLLARS, AND
TO DEPRIVE THE MERCHANTS OF "SLOW DEATH" OF BROAD ACCESS TO THE "BLACK
MARKET" IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LION'S
SHARE OF SOUTH AMERICA'S POISONOUS EXPORT IS CONSUMED.  IN OTHER
WORDS, AN IMPORTANT STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COMBAT ONE OF THE MAIN
"EVILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY," AND IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE
MEETING'S RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY APPRAISED BY UN SECRETARY GENERAL J.
PEREZ DE CUELLAR.

   HERE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION: EMPHASIS IN CARTAGENA WAS PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICE MEASURES AND ON WASHINGTON'S PRIMARILY
MILITARIZED FORMS OF COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN STATES, BUT DOES THIS
CONFORM WITH THEIR LONG-TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS, WITH THEIR DESIRE TO
PUT AN END TO BACKWARDNESS AND ATTAIN A QUALITATIVELY NEW LEVEL OF
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  AFTER ALL, A RADICAL SOLUTION OF THE DRUG
PROBLEM PRIMARILY DEMANDS NEITHER COMBAT AIRCRAFT NOT ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS, BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.  IT IS NECESSARY TO
CHANGE THE ECONOMIC PROFILE OF VAST PROVINCES WHERE THE CULTIVATION OF
COCA AND MARIJUANA IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE POPULATION'S EXISTENCE.

   TRUE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW EXPRESSED READINESS TO
ASSIST ALSO IN THIS SPHERE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ALMOST
TOTAL LACK OF READINESS TO IMPORT FROM SOUTH AMERICA THE CROPS WHICH
COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, SQUEEZE OUT COCA AND MARIJUANA.  IT WAS NOT FOR
NOTHING THAT COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THE WHITE HOUSE'S
CLOSEST ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS, WAS FORCED TO DECLARE IN
CARTAGENA THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGID PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ARE
JEOPARDIZING THE VERY FUTURE OF "ALTERNATIVE" SECTORS OF TROPICAL CROP
FARMING -- THE CULTIVATION OF COFFEE, FLOWERS, AND SUGAR CANE.  AND SO
THE "SENIOR PARTNER" APPEARS TO BE TIGHTENING WITH THE ONE HAND THE
VISE IN WHICH THE DRUG MAFIA NOW FINDS ITSELF, WHILE USING THE OTHER
HAND TO PROTECT ITS MARKET FROM LEGAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPORTS.

   FINALLY, THE LAST BUT, I THINK, MOST SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT.
ACTUALLY, IT ALSO CASTS AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF CONSISTENT
FIGHTER AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA WHICH WASHINGTON HAS NOW ASSUMED.  THIS
ARGUMENT IS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED IN JUST ONE SHORT WORD: "PANAMA."
INDEED, DID THE RECENT AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS SOVEREIGN STATE, ONE OF
WHOSE MAIN MOTIVES WAS ACTUALLY "TO PUNISH THE DRUG BUSINESS BOSSES,"
NOT DEMONSTRATE ALL THE FLAWS OF WASHINGTON'S "STRONGARM APPROACH"
TOWARD LATIN AMERICA?  AND ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THE PENTAGON
WILL NOT START "COPYING" ITS PANAMANIAN EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IN THE CONTINENT ON THE PRETEXT OF PURSUING THE "COCAINE BARONS"?

   THESE ARE FAR FROM RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, AND IT IS A PITY THAT
CARTAGENA SIMPLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLEAR-CUT
ANSWERS TO THEM.

   TEGUCIGALPA, 22 FEB 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS
CHARGED IN TEGUCIGALPA TODAY THAT ON 19 FEBRUARY THE SANDINIST AIR
FORCE USED AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO BOMB SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN
ZELAYA, MATAGALPA, AND JINOTEGA DEPARTMENTS, IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN
NICARAGUA.

   THE REBELS DID NOT REPORT ANY DEAD OR WOUNDED IN THE ALLEGED
ATTACKS, WHICH THE CONTRAS SAY ARE PART OF AN OFFENSIVE BEGUN IN THE
DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE CONTRAS INDICATED THAT THEIR FIGHTERS ARE NOT
ATTACKING SANDINIST MILITARY TARGETS, AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE
NICARAGUAN MILITARY ACTION WAS TO "CREATE CONFUSION" REGARDING THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, COMMANDER "FRANKLIN" OF THE NICARAGUAN
RESISTANCE (RN) GENERAL STAFF SAID THAT THE RN WILL REMAIN "INTACT,"
EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THE ELECTIONS ARE WON BY VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO,
CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION (UNO).

   "WE WILL REMAIN INTACT TO SEE IF THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSMISSION OF
POWER ON 25 APRIL, IN WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE IN-DEPTH
REFORMS, PARTICULARLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM," HE
ADDED.

   THE RN MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR "STEAL"
THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A "SOCIAL UPRISING" IN NICARAGUA AGAINST
THE SYSTEM, AND THERE WILL BE "A HARSHER STRUGGLE THAN THAT OF PAST
YEARS."

   "FRANKLIN" SAID THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED SOME 30,000
TROOPS TO DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER"
UNO SYMPATHIZERS.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTRAS WILL NOT PUT DOWN
THEIR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THOSE
FORCES -- THE SANDINISTS' ASCENT TO POWER -- "HAS NOT YET
DISAPPEARED," AND "THE REPRESSION CONTINUES."

   HE ADDED THAT HIS FIGHTERS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THE CAMPS IN
EASTERN HONDURAS IF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTS THAT THEY DO SO,
BUT THEIR FAMILIES WOULD REMAIN.

   BUENOS AIRES, 22 FEB 90 (DYN) -- [TEXT] A RELIABLE SOURCE TODAY
DISCLOSED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF CHILEAN ARMED FORCES TO SOUTHERN
CHILE, INCLUDING ARMORED UNITS, AND THE IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND
QUALITY OF THE WEAPONS OF THE CHILEAN ARMED FORCES ARE CAUSING CONCERN
IN THE DEFENSE AREA.

   THE SOURCE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MANUFACTURE OF A HELICOPTER
BY A PRIVATE CHILEAN FACTORY AS WELL AS THE PURCHASE OF SPANISH AND
U.S.-MADE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS.

   THE HELICOPTER, WHOSE PROTOTYPE HAS ALREADY FLOWN A LARGE NUMBER OF
HOURS, HAS RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF THE U.S. "AVIATION AGENCY"
[PRECEDING TWO WORDS IN ENGLISH], AN INDISPENSABLE REQUIREMENT FOR
SUBSEQUENT SALES ABROAD. IT IS MANUFACTURED BY THE PRIVATE CHILEAN
FACTORY CARDOEN WHICH PRODUCES CLUSTER BOMBS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL
THAT CHILE EXPORTS TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT, DUE TO ITS EASY MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND
LOW COST, THIS HELICOPTER IS IDEAL FOR EXPORT TO TRADITIONAL CHILEAN
MARKETS SINCE SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCTION IS EASY TO ACHIEVE.

   THE SOURCE ALSO INDICATED THAT IN NOVEMBER, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF
CHILEAN ARMY AVIATION, THREE SPANISH-MADE CASA 235 AIRPLANES, WHICH
CAN BE USED TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS AND CARGO, AND 15 U.S.-MADE
ENSTROM 280 HELICOPTERS WERE PRESENTED.

   THE SOURCE DID NOT DISCLOSE "OTHER DATA," WHICH "REVEALS A
STRENGTHENING OF THE CHILEAN NAVAL, AIR, SEA, AND COMBAT AVIATION
RECENTLY."

ALLEGED GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDOS MACHINEGUNNED POLICEMEN AT THE
INTERSECTION OF NO. 5 WEST STREET AND NO. 5 NORTH AVENUE.  AN ARMY MEMBER

   IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT AN OFFICER AND FOUR SOLDIERS WERE
SERIOUSLY WOUNDED DURING A HEAVY CLASH WITH GUERRILLAS AT NO. 79 NORTH
AVENUE.  THE SKIRMISHES TOOK PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY AT APPROXIMATELY

   BOGOTA, 24 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE RECENT CEASE-FIRE OFFER BY
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC) WAS ACCEPTED TODAY
BY THE SO-CALLED COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, WHOSE MEMBERS ARE FIVE FORMER
PRESIDENTS, AND CHURCH AND BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.

   HOWEVER, IN A MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO THE GUERRILLAS' CENTRAL COMMAND,
THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES SAID THAT, ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS PUT INTO
EFFECT, THE FARC WILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE "WITH UNEQUIVOCAL DEEDS,"
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO INITIATE PEACE TALKS.

   THE FARC -- THE COUNTRY'S OLDEST AND LARGEST GUERRILLA GROUP -- HAS
EXPRESSED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THEIR INTENTION OF DECREEING A
CEASE-FIRE, ALTHOUGH YESTERDAY, ACCORDING TO ARMY SPOKESMEN, A FARC
COLUMN KILLED SEVEN SOLDIERS AND KIDNAPPED 15 DURING AN ATTACK ON AN
ARMY GARRISON.

   A FEW DAYS AGO, THE COMMISSION OF NOTABLES, MADE UP OF FORMER
PRESIDENTS CARLOS LLERAS RSTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ MIC HELSEN, JULIO
CESAR TURBAY, MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, AND BELISARIO BETANCUR, AS WELL
AS CARDINAL MARIO REVOLLO BRAVO AND BUSINESSMAN FABIO ECHEVERRI
CORREA, TOLD THE FARC THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD A RIGHT TO FIGHT THEM.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY HOLDING PEACE TALKS ONLY WITH
THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), WHICH WILL SOON BE DEMOBILIZING THEIR
FRONTS TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT THIS YEAR IT WILL STEP UP ITS ATTACKS IN AN EFFORT TO
SABOTAGE THE 11 MARCH MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND THE 27
MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   MEDELLIN, 24 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] TWO U.S. CITIZENS, WHO HAD BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY GUERRILLAS ON 12 FEBRUARY IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT IN
NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA, WERE RELEASED TODAY.

   JAMUS ARTHUR DONELLY, AN AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS SALESMAN, AND
PROFESSOR DAVIS LESLIE KENT, WHO SPOKE TO NEWSMEN IN MEDELLIN,
REVEALED A MESSAGE FROM THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION,
(ELN) WHICH HELD THEM HOSTAGE FOR 12 DAYS.

   "THE NEXT TIME THERE IS A MASSACRE OR THE GOVERNMENT CAUSES THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE OF OUR COMPANIONS, SUCH AS JUAN FERNANDO PORRAS,
THE ELN WILL PUNISH THE WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE OLIGARCHY OF COLOMBIA,"
THE EXTREMIST GROUP'S MESSAGE STATED.  BOTH DONELLY, 62, AS WELL AS
KENT, 40, SAID THEY WERE TREATED WELL BY THE REBELS, WITH WHOM THEY
HAD BROAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA.

   ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS, THE ELN KIDNAPPED THEM AS PART
OF THE SO-CALLED "OPERATION COLOMBIA" TO PROTEST THE RECENT PRESENCE
OF U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IN COLOMBIA, WHICH HOSTED THE RECENT 15
FEBRUARY ARTIDRUG SUMMIT IN CARTAGENA, AND WHAT THEY CALLED
"INCREASING U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA."

   DONELLY AND KENT WERE TURNED OVER BY THE ELN TO A COMMISSION MADE
UP OF OFFICIALS OF THE ANTIOQUIA REGIONAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
AND MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IN A REGION NEAR COCORNA,
80 KM SOUTHEAST OF MEDELLIN.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 FEB 90 (LA VOZ PANAMERICANA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WITH
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT] [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE BELIEVE THAT THE
ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA WILL MARK A NEW PHASE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
SITUATION.  THINGS WILL NOT BE THE SAME IN THAT NEIGHBORING NATION AND
I BELIEVE THAT THE EVOLUTION WILL FAVOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE AT
THE REGIONAL LEVEL.  MOREOVER, THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS AT THE WORLD
LEVEL THAT ALSO ALLOW US TO HAVE HOPE.  LET US NOT FORGET THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS PARTICULARLY IS STRIVING TO ORGANIZE A NEW ROUND OF
TALKS.  THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE BEING SET SO
THAT PEACE MAY BE ACHIEVED THIS YEAR.  THE CHURCH URGES THOSE WHO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS DECISION TO DO IT AND THUS PAY HOMAGE TO OUR
ARCHBISHOP MSGR [OSCAR ARNULFO] ROMERO, WHO DIED 10 YEARS AGO, AND A
MAN WHO STRUGGLED FOR PEACE, ENGINEER [JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE.  THAT
WAS OUR PROPOSAL IN TODAY'S HOMILY.

   [REPORTER] WILL THERE BE ANY DEMAND FOR AN INVESTIGATION OR
RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH MSGR ROMERO WAS ASSASSINATED 10
YEARS AGO?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE SOLUTION OF THIS CASE
BASICALLY DEPENDS ON A POLITICAL DECISION TO DO IT.  THEREFORE, IT
COULD REMAIN UNSOLVED OR IT COULD BE QUICKLY SOLVED.  WE WOULD LIKE TO
THINK THAT A POLITICAL DECISION WOULD BE ADOPTED, BUT WE HAVE NO
INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT THIS WILL BE SO.  INSTEAD, IT IS MORE A
WISH, I BELIEVE IT IS A LEGITIMATE WISH, OF ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
THEY WANT THE CASE TO BE SOLVED AND, ABOVE ALL, THEY WANT JUSTICE.
THIS BLOOD SHOULD BEAR FRUIT BY ACHIEVING PEACE AND RESPECT AMONG MEN,
AS A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL COEXISTENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  VIOLENCE SHOULD
NO LONGER EXIST AMONG US AND RECONCILIATION SHOULD QUICKLY BECOME A
REALITY AMONG SALVADORANS.

   [REPORTER] A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE REVEALED THAT COL.  [GUILLERMO
ALFREDO] BENAVIDES HAS RECENTLY BEEN SEEN AT A SEASIDE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRIALS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY WILL BE
ANOTHER TEST [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH] FOR SALVADORAN JUSTICE.  IT
HAS FAILED ALMOST ALL OTHER TESTS [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH].  LET US
SEE HOW IT FARES THIS TIME, NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF ITS PRESTIGE, BUT
ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE HONOR OF SUCH A MUCH-SACRIFICED PEOPLE AND
THE NEED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE HOPE.  I BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT STEPS HAVE
BEEN TAKEN, BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO PROVE THAT THESE STEPS WILL LEAD
TO A TRULY JUST CONCLUSION -- OR IF THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN BE CUT SHORT.
LET US HOPE THAT PROGRESS WILL BE ACHIEVED AND, AS WE HAVE STATED ON
OTHER OCCASIONS, THAT THE NAMES OF THE INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF THIS
CRIME WILL ALSO BE KNOWN.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 FEB 90 -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH MSGR GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, WITH UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, REFERRING TO THE WEEK'S
EVENTS, YOU DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION CASE MENTIONED BY THE
GOVERNMENT.  WHAT IMPLICATIONS MIGHT THIS CASE HAVE?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT
MAY BE BEHIND THIS NEW SITUATION.  WE MUST WAIT AWHILE FOR SOME TIME
AND LEARN THE DETAILS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH
SHOULD BE SOLVED.  WE WOULD NOT LIKE TO EXPAND ON THIS.  ALL WE WOULD
LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE THINK THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE SHOULD KNOW TO
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE THIS WEEK.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK A FRAUD CAN BE PERPETRATED IN THE
NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE THINK THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS IN NICARAGUA,
IT WILL REPRESENT A POSITIVE STEP FOR THAT COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE
REGION.  THE NICARAGUAN CHURCH SHARES OUR VIEWS, MEANING THE PASTORS
OF THAT NATION.  THAT IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE
COULD BE NEAR FOR EL SALVADOR.  HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF WE AVAILED
OURSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.

   [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL ASSISTANCE HAS
HELPED CLEAR MANY DEATHS IN EL SALVADOR.  MONSIGNOR ROMERO WAS KILLED
10 YEARS AGO.  DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE
OFFICE HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO MIGHT BE BEHIND THIS DEATH?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THAT THERE ARE MANY CLUES
WHICH LEAD TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS BUT, ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT LEGAL
SYSTEM, THOSE CLUES CANNOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE.  THUS, ONE CAN BE
CERTAIN OF WHO THE KILLERS ARE AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE IT.
THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT FRUSTRATIONS CREATED BY OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.  IT
IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL IDEAS, WHICH WE HAVE COMMENTED ON MANY
TIMES, OF WHO THE MONSIGNOR'S KILLERS MAY BE.  ONCE MORE I SAY THAT
THIS IS A MATTER OF MAKING A POLITICAL DECISION, PARTICULARLY TO CLEAR
THE CASE OR LET IT REMAIN UNSOLVED.

   [REPORTER] MONSIGNOR, FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE HAS DIED.  WHAT IS
YOUR OPINION OF DUARTE'S ROLE CONCERNING THE CHURCH?

   [ROSA CHAVEZ] WE WILL STATE IT THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE SPECIAL
MASS WITH ALMOST ALL THE BISHOPS OF EL SALVADOR.  THAT ANSWERS YOUR
QUESTION.  I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SEE THREE LEVELS: THE MAN, THE
CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN.  THE LETTER THAT THE ARCHBISHOP SENT TO
DUARTE'S WIDOW, MRS. INES, STATES SOME IDEAS ON THE MAN, THE
CHRISTIAN, AND THE POLITICIAN.  THIS AFTERNOON THE ARCHBISHOP WILL
HAVE A SPECIAL HOMILY AND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY GIVE A MORE COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH'S VIEWS.  WE CAN ADD THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO
TRIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH.  HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS
OPEN TO THE CHURCH'S PROPOSAL.

   BOGOTA, 26 FEB 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL
HOPEFULES, LIBERALS ERNESTO SAMPER PIZANO AND HERNANDO DURAN AND
CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS
TODAY TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE
MEDELLIN CARTEL, AFTER THE EXTRADITABLES VOICED THEIR DESIRE FOR SUCH
TALKS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ASKED THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY TO COME UP
WITH THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TURN THEMSELVES IN
TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, SUCH AS SURRENDERING THEIR WEAPONS, AMMUNITION,
AND EXPLOSIVES, ACCORDING TO A LETTER DELIVERED TO THE GROUP OF
NOTABLES, A GROUP OF MEDIATORS.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES REJECTED THE
PROPOSALS MADE BY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THERE WILL BE NO MECHANISMS AND NO COMMISSIONS OTHER THAN THE
COURTS, LEMOS SAID WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SENT TO THE GROUP
OF NOTABLES FROM MEDELLIN.

   THE GROUP OF NOTABLES IS COMPOSED OF FORMER LIBERAL PRESIDENTS
ALFONSO LOPEZ AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY, FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA, BOGOTA ARCHBISHOP AND CARDINAL MARIO
REVOLLO, AND DIEGO MONTANA, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION
(UP).

   LIBERAL SENATOR SAMPER PIZANO, AFTER LEARNING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' PROPOSAL, SAID THAT THERE ARE
CERTAIN WARMONGERING SPIRITS IN THE GOVERNMENT, WHO MUST CHANGE THEIR
ATTITUDE SO AS TO PUT AN END TO THE WAR.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ADDED THAT THE OFFERS MADE BY THE
EXTRADITABLES COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE DE JURE STATE
OR THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS.

   HERNANDO DURAN DESCRIBED THE PROPOSAL AS A STEP FORWARD IN THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
AND HE WARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS OFFICERS MUST RESPOND TO
THIS PROPOSAL.

   I BELIEVE THE NEW OFFER TENDS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF DETENTE
BETWEEN THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF, DURAN SAID.

   SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE RODRIGO LLOREDA SAID THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS THE OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO THE EXTRADITABLES, AND HE
ADDED THAT WHEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL DO SO.

   HOWEVER, LLOREDA CAICEDO SAID THAT THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR
REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON THEIR SURRENDER IS TO HAVE THOSE WHO
COMMITTED CRIMES TURN THEMSELVES IN AND BE JUDGED BY THE COLOMBIAN
JUSTICE SYSTEM.  HE ADDED: IT IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR THEM TO COMPENSATE
THE VICTIMS OF THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS; THERE SHOULD BE GUARANTEES FOR
THE DISMANTLING OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS; THERE SHOULD BE A
SUSPENSION OF THE PROCESSING AND SHIPMENT OF COCAINE ABROAD; AND
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN TO VERIFY THE PROCESS.

IN AYACUCHO THAT AT LEAST 16 MEMBERS OF THE "PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL"
(THE CIVILIAN MILITIA THAT FIGHTS SUBVERSION) DIED AND ANOTHER 30 WERE
WOUNDED DURING AN ATTACK BY A "SHINING PATH" COLUMN.

   TRUCK DRIVERS WHO TRANSPORT FREIGHT TO THE ZONE AND WHO ARRIVED
TODAY FROM MACHENTE (LA MAR PROVINCE), 196 KM NORTHEAST OF AYACUCHO,
HAVE REPORTED THAT THE SHINING PATH ATTACK TOOK PLACE UNEXPECTEDLY ON
FRIDAY NIGHT.  THE DRIVERS REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN DENIED NOR CONFIRMED
BY MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.  THEY REPORTED THAT THEY SAW
AMBULANCES CARRYING THE WOUNDED TO THE HOSPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO, LA
MAR PROVINCE.

   THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU NOW STANDS AT
MORE THAN 600 THIS YEAR, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED SINCE
THE "SHINING PATH" BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980 NOW TOTALS 18,000
ACCORDING TO A CONGRESS COMMISSION WHICH IS STUDYING THE CAUSES OF
VIOLENCE IN PERU.

   POLICE SOURCES TODAY REPORTED IN AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF
LIMA, THAT ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY RELATIVES, OVER THE PAST WEEK 30
YOUNG MEN WERE ABDUCTED BY SHINING PATH COLUMNS THAT INTERCEPT
PASSENGER BUSES AND PRIVATE VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAYS IN THE
DEPARTMENT.

   THE SOURCES ADDED THAT THE MAOIST GROUP IS RECRUITING PEOPLE LIKE
THAT FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION, UNDER THREATS OF DEATH.

   THE GOVERNMENT TODAY EXTENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR 60 DAYS IN
NINE OF THE 24 DEPARTMENTS INTO WHICH PERU IS POLITICALLY DIVIDED,
AMONG THEM AYACUCHO, BECAUSE OF THE TERRORIST ACTION THAT PERSISTS IN
THOSE AREAS.

   THIS MEASURE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL 2 WEEKS AFTER THE GENERAL
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS THAT ARE SCHEDULED FOR 8 APRIL 1990.  


DEV-MUC3-1144 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] MARIA DE DOLORES ARJAC.

   [ARJAC] IT IS SAID THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR WAS STOPPED [WORD
INDISTINCT] FOR AID TO PANAMA. COULD IT NOT HAPPEN -- WITH MRS.
CHAMORRA'S VICTORY -- THAT READJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IN AID TO SEVERAL
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING EL SALVADOR?  IN THIS RESPECT,
THE FRG GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY RENEWED AID TO EL SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO
OTHER COUNTRIES.  HOW DO YOU SEE THIS SITUATION?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, THIS COULD WELL HAPPEN, AS, OBVIOUSLY, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE FREE TO
GIVE AID TO WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO.
CERTAINLY THERE IS A NEW SITUATION, AND MANY HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY THAT
THEY ARE WILLING TO HELP NICARAGUA, AS WELL AS PANAMA AND OTHERS.
THIS SITUATION COULD PERFECTLY WELL LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF AID TO EL
SALVADOR.  THIS IS A POSSIBILITY.

   [MODERATOR] JUAN BURGOS OF INTERPRESS SERVICE.

   [BURGOS] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] UN SECRETARY GENERAL THAT ARE
INTERPRETED AS THAT PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO YOU AND TO THE ARMED
FORCES COMMANDERS BY SOME POLITICAL LEADERS.

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL CAN TESTIFY TO MY STATEMENTS, THAT OUR POSITION HAS
BEEN FITTING AND CONSISTENT AND THAT WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE
EXPRESSED TO HIM AT PRESENT.  WE DID PLACE AS A PRE-CONDITION THAT THE
FMLN STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS.  IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS, AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CONDEMNED TERRORISM, CANNOT
BACK OUR POSITION, AS WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE FMLN TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  BUT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR POSITION, AND IT IS THE SAME ONE
WE EXPRESSED TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [MODERATOR) MARGARITA ARTEGA OF ACAN-EFE.

   [ARTEAGA] MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THE
MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS TODAY [WORDS INDISTINCT] COULD BE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE STATE OF SIEGE IS ABOUT TO LIFTED, AS,
SUPPOSEDLY, CONCENTRATIONS AND MOBILIZATIONS ARE PROHIBITED?

   [CRISTIANI] IT DEPENDS ON THE SECURITY SITUATION.  THE STATE OF
SIEGE IS NOT PERMANENT.  WE MUST ANALYZE THE CONTEXT OF THE THREAT
THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH REGARD TO SECURITY.  WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS,
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED THEM, CLAIMING THAT THE FMLN HAS SAID
THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO LAUNCH ANY MORE OFFENSIVES.  IT IS A GOOD
SIGN THAT THE FMLN IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO A DIALOGUE, AND THIS COULD
PRODUCE THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE.  AS YOU KNOW, THE STATE OF
SIEGE HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED.  IT IS NOT THE SAME.  WE HAVE BEEN
REDUCING IT PROGRESSIVELY AND IT IS NOW STRICTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY.

   [MODERATOR] FRANCISCO ESPINOSA FOR ABC NEWS.

   [ESPINOZA] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.  I BELIEVE THAT FOR A DIALOGUE TO
TAKE PLACE, THE PRE-CONDITION HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF NICARGUAN
ELECTION RESULTS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FMLN.  OUR POSITION IS
BASED ON PRINCIPLES, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE NOT CONTINUE TO
SUFFER THE VIOLENCE GENERATED BY FMLN TERRORISM.  THUS, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTIONS.  OBVIOUSLY,
I BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS WILL AFFECT THE FMLN
IN SOME MEASURES, AND THIS COULD INCLUDE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I DO NOT
KNOW.  WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT POSITION THEY WILL TAKE IN THE
FUTURE, BUT IT COULD BE.  OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AND WILL
HAVE AN IMPACT AND COULD MOVE THE FMLN TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1145 (UNISYS)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] AND, THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT IS A
TOTAL ADVANCEMENT IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT
VERY DEMOCRATIC TO HAVE THE ARMED FORCES OF A COUNTRY UNDER THE
CONTROL OF ONE OF ITS POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE ARMED FORCES OF A
COUNTRY SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND TO THE GOVERNMENT
THAT IS LEGITIMATELY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.  AND THEREFORE, THIS WOULD
CURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO
CONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE
POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY.  SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT
WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH
RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.
AND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE.
OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA
THAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT
IT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE
RESULT IN ITSELF.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS
CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE
SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE
FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR
THEM.  AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM.

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS
AGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES
WAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN
THAT PIECE.  AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT
HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE
WAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE
TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL
GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT
GOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE
THE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID
THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO
STEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT [WORD INDISTINCT]?  SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
SHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE
DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS
WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU
CONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES.  IT IS
YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE
DETERMINING FACTOR.

   SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST
FOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS, [CHUCKLES] THAT ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM.  SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS
NOT REALLY THE POINT.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF
DEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE.  I THINK THAT THEY ALL
ARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS,
BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING
OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN [WORDS
INDISTINCT] ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE?  AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?

   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE
BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS,
WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  YOU JUST MENTIONED THE
FACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE
COUNTRY.  JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
HURT.  TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION.
SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP.  THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST
ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY.  THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED
AGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES.  SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT
CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR --
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE
COUNTRY.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 1 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT
MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS HAS HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE MARXIST
GUERRILLA GROUP ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION [ELN] WHO HAVE MURDERED THE 77
FOLLOWERS OF THE LEFT-WING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC UNION [UP].

   LEMOS SAID: I CAN EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THE ELN.  HE ADDED THAT HE
BELIEVED THAT THIS GROUP MAKES NO EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT WANTS TO KILL
SOMEONE.

   THE UP HAS BLAMED PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT AND THE
MILITARY FOR THE ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITS MEMBERS, DEMANDING
GUARANTEES FOR THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WITH LESS THAN TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE.

   THE UP MADE THE REPORT FOLLOWING THE MURDER ON 26 FEBRUARY OF
APARTADO MAYOR DIANA CORDOBA SALDARRIAGA -- APARTADO IS LOCATED 480 KM
TO THE NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA -- AND THE MURDER ON THE EVENING OF 27
FEBRUARY OF SIX MORE UP FOLLOWERS IN UNGUIA, A VILLAGE IN CHOCO
DEPARTMENT.  WHEN BLAMING THE ELN, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAID THAT
THESE INDIVIDUALS WANT TO BRING ANARCHY AND INSTABILITY TO THE
COUNTRY.  LEMOS ADDED THAT AS PART OF THE ELN'S DESTABLIZATION
CAMPAIGN, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE
THE MURDER PEOPLE OF OTHER LEFT-WING SECTORS AS THEIR GOAL, AND
ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF THREATS AGAINST VARIOUS
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING HIMSELF.  WHEN REFERRING TO THE UP'S
REPORTS HOLDING THE MILITARY RESPONSIBLE, HE SAID THAT THIS WAS ABSURD
AND ADDED THAT IT IS INTENDED TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS ASTRAY AND TO
TRY TO STOP THE ELECTIONS IN COLOMBIA.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO HAS ACCUSED U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK OF
INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   "IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR AN AMBASSADOR OF ANY COUNTRY TO OPENLY
INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY," SAID CEREZO
TODAY IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. DIPLOMAT.  STROOK HAD EXPRESSED HIS
CONCERN THIS WEEK OVER THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND THE
GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS' INCOMPETENCE IN CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.

   CEREZO REQUESTED THAT STROOK DEFINE HIS STATUS, "WHETHER AS AN
AMBASSADOR OR A PRIVATE PERSON."  HE ALSO ASKED STROOK TO "CONSULT
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS AN OFFICIAL POLICY OR NOT."

   "IF IT IS, WE WOULD HAVE TO OPEN UP A DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT," SAID THE PRESIDENT.  HE ADDED THAT HE IS HANDLING THE
MATTER WITH "PRUDENCE AND SENSITIVITY, BUT WITH FIRMNESS."

   CEREZO ALSO NOTED THAT IF STROOK "WANTS TO GIVE PERSONAL OPINIONS
ABOUT GUATEMALAN PROBLEMS, HE WILL HAVE TO DO SO INDEPENDENTLY FROM
HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR."

   DURING A SPEECH GIVEN TO ROTARY CLUB MEMBERS ON 27 FEBRUARY, THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED HOW THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
DEALT WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION.

   THE DIPLOMAT STATED THEN: "I WOULD NOT BE SINCERE IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
NOT SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION."

   "THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF STUDENTS, POLITICAL LEADERS,
PEASANTS, AND WORKERS HAVE US DEEPLY WORRIED," HE ADDED, NOTING THAT
"THE CONTINOUS REPORTS ABOUT UNKNOWN PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED OR
KIDNAPPED IN THE COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS HAVE NOT ONLY GREATLY DISTURBED
PEOPLE IN GUATEMALA, BUT ALSO THE WORLD OVER."

   STROOK STATED HE WAS SURPRISED THAT IN NONE OF THE CASES HAD THE
GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AND TAKE TO COURT "THE
VILE AND COWARDLY CRIMINALS WHO HAD COMMITTED THESE ABOMINABLE ACTS."

   DURING HIS SPEECH THE DIPLOMAT ALSO CRITICIZED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
SITUATION IN GUATEMALA AND "THE SAD SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REALITY" OF
THE COUNTRY, WHERE MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S 9 MILLION INHABITANTS LIVE IN
ABJECT POVERTY.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 3 MAR 90 (CIRCUITO RPC TELEVISION) --
[REPORT] [JULIO MILLER, DIRECTOR OF RPC NEWS DEPARTMENT] [TEXT] DEAR
TELEVISION AUDIENCE, WE BRIEFLY INTERRUPT OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING TO
OFFER YOU A REPORT OF GENERAL INTEREST.  THE FILM CLIPS WE WILL SEE IN
A FEW MINUTES WERE TAKEN THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT AT THE
RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN BELLA VISTA CORREGIMIENTO, EL
CANGREJO NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN PEOPLE WERE STAGING A PEACEFUL
DEMONSTRATION PROMPTED BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO
GRANT SAFE-CONDUCTS TO SOME OF THE PANAMANIANS CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  AMONG THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE GRANTED SAFE-CONDUCTS ARE MARCELA TASON,
FORMER PRIVATE SECRETARY OF OUSTED PANAMANIAN DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO.
CAPTAINS HERACLIDES SUCRE, AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, INVOLVED IN THE
KILLING OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI ARE ALSO AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  THE
FILM CLIPS SHOW PART OF THE INTENSE PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR, OR
RATHER ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN
PANAMA CITY.

   DEMONSTRATORS THREW STONES AT THE EMBASSY WINDOWS AND LATER SET
FIRE TO PART OF THE RESIDENCY INSTALLATIONS.  [CROWD SHOUTS: "THIS
DAMNED THING IS ON FIRE!" THREE TIMES] DURING THE PROTEST NOT ONE OF
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE DIPLOMATIC
QUARTERS.  PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS AND EVEN THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE AT THE RESIDENCY REMAINED
INSIDE.  PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE UNITS UNSUCESSFULLY TRIED TO CONTROL
DEMONSTRATORS.  DURING THE INCIDENT, A PUBLIC FORCE MEMBER WHO TRIED
TO PREVENT THE INCIDENT WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED.  THESE SCENES WERE
FILMED THIS AFTERNOON AND DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS BY OUR
CAMERAMAN JOSE CASIS JR. AND SHOW PART OF THE PROTEST ACTIONS AGAINST
THE RESIDENCY.

   MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, FORMER DEFENSE FORCES PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICER, AND THE OTHER CAPTAINS WE MENTIONED BEFORE ARE
CURRENTLY AT THE RESIDENCY.  LET US LISTEN TO PART OF THE STATEMENTS
BY THE WIDOW OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ADELA DE GIROLDI] HE [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] TOLD US
THAT HE WILL TAKE US TO FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO
ARIAS CALDERON.

   [REPORTER] DID YOU AGREE TO THAT?

   [GIROLDI] I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE KILLED.  I THINK THERE
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE KILLED.  I BELIEVE THE PRESSURE WE HAVE
EXERTED IS ENOUGH.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL BE YOUR POSITION WHEN YOU TALK TO THE
MINISTER?

   [GIROLDI] I WANT THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION SO THAT
THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES TURN THOSE PEOPLE OVER TO THE PANAMANIANS.  I
THINK IT IS A MATTER OF FIRMLY DEMANDING THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT
TURNS THIS PEOPLE OVER TO PANAMA.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, IF THERE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE TODAY,
BY THE AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT MEASURES WILL YOU ADOPT?
WILL YOU CONTINUE PROTESTING?

   [GIROLDI] OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE PROTESTING.  WE WILL CONTINUE
PROTESTING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WE ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT THESE
PEOPLE SURRENDER TO PANAMANIAN JUSTICE SO THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED
BECAUSE THEY KILLED....[CHANGES THOUGHT] HERACLIDES SUCRE FIRED AT MY
HUSBAND, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, HE MACHINEGUNNED MY HUSBAND IN COLD
BLOOD.  OTHER OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO TOOK PART IN THE 3 OCTOBER
COUP WERE TORTURED, CUT WITH MACHETES. [END RECORDING]

   THE FOLLOWING FILM CLIPS SHOW A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC GUILLERMO ENDARA, VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
THE WIDOWS OF OFFICERS AND MILITARYMEN MISSING OR KILLED ON 3 OCTOBER
1989 IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP.  THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT, THE
VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE DEMONSTRATORS WAS POSITIVE.  DEMONSTRATORS
PROMISED TO REMAIN CALM AND WAIT UNTIL PANAMANIAN JUSTICE DETERMINES
THE RESPONSIBILITY, AND ISSUE SENTENCES FOR THOSE CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  LATER ON VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
PRESIDENT ENDARA MADE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  WE WILL LISTEN FIRST
TO STATEMENTS BY VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON.  [CONTINUED]

[REPORT] [JULIO MILLER, DIRECTOR OF RPC NEWS DEPARTMENT] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARIAS] THE PRESIDENT AND MYSELF
VIGOROUSLY DEPLORE WHAT TRANSPIRED THIS AFTERNOON AT THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY.  I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TALK TO
MRS.  GIROLDI, AND SHE ASSURED US THAT HER ONLY INTENTION WAS TO STAGE
A PEACEFUL PROTEST AND AT NO TIME DID THEY PLAN TO INCLUDE ANY VIOLENT
ACTS.  MRS. GIROLDI SAID THAT SHE IS VERY SURPRISED THAT SOME PEOPLE
WHOM SHE DOES NOT KNOW AND HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE PROMOTED VIOLENT
ACTS.  SHE TOLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC THAT SHE WILL TALK TO
THE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AND THAT
VIOLENCE IS NOT THE AIM.

   THE PRESIDENT AND I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE IS DOING; WE UNDERSTAND
HER PAIN.  WE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT AUTHORIZED
ANY SAFE-CONDUCTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER.
THOSE CASES ARE BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE
MINISTER OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.

   [REPORTER] IS A BREAK IN RELATIONS EXPECTED BETWEEN PANAMA AND
PERU DUE TO THE VIOLENT ACTIONS?

   [ARIAS] NOT AT ALL.  I TALKED TO THE PERUVIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES
AFTER OUR FOREIGN MINISTER TALKED TO HIM.  HE KNOWS THAT THE NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT PROFOUNDLY REGRETS WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED; THAT THE PEOPLE WHO
WERE PROTESTING THERE, SUCH AS MRS GIROLDI, HAD NO PLANS TO CARRY OUT
VIOLENT ACTIONS.  UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE, WHOSE IDENTITY WE WILL TRY TO
DETERMINE, URGED THE THROWING OF FIRE BOMBS AGAINST THE EMBASSY.  THE
FOREIGN MINISTER AND MYSELF EXPRESSED OUR APOLOGIES TO THE PERUVIAN
GOVERNMENT FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES OR INSECURITY FELT BY ITS PERSONNEL.

   [ENDARA] THESE ARE VERY REGRETFUL INCIDENTS.  NOT ONLY A BASIC
COURTESY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE, THAT IS TO RESPECT THE RESIDENCES OF
OTHER PEOPLE, AND MORE SO WHEN THEY BELONG TO REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER
COUNTRIES, BUT A PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED.
THAT PRINCIPLE IS DUE RESPECT FOR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.

   WHAT REALLY WORRIES US ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS A REPORT GIVEN TO US
BY THE ORGANIZERS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE EMBASSY.  SPECIFICALLY, BY
THE WIDOWS OF MEN MURDERED BY THOSE WHO ARE REFUGED IN THAT EMBASSY;
THE WIDOW OF MAJOR GIROLDI WAS HERE, AND SHE TOLD US THAT ALL HER
ACTIONS AT THE EMBASSY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL.

   SHE TOLD US THAT TODAY THEY NOTICED THAT TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE
WERE PRESENT AND THESE PEOPLE PROVOKED THE VIOLENCE; THEY INSTIGATED
THE VIOLENCE.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE CERTAIN GROUPS ARE SEEKING TO SPOIL
OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY.  THEY WANT TO PREVENT THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WITH JUSTICE AND LIBERTY AT ALL
COSTS.

   I BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT MUST BE DENOUNCED BEFORE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE NATION.  HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THESE PROVOCATIONS.
NEVERTHELESS, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH URGES THE CITIZENS TO NOT ALLOW
PEOPLE TO PROVOKE THEM INTO PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT ACTIONS SUCH AS
ONE WHICH OCCURRED TODAY.  THE CITIZENS MUST NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO
EXPLOIT THE FEELINGS THAT ALL PANAMNIANS FEEL TOWARDS CRIMINALS AND
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND WHO ARE HOLED UP IN EMBASSIES
SUCH AS THIS ONE; WE URGE CITIZENS TO AVOID BEING PROVOKED. [END RECORDING]

MAYORS, TWO DEPUTIES, SIX EXECUTIVES, CATTLEMEN, BUSINESSMEN, FARMERS,
AND A POLICEMAN.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, 12 KIDNAPPINGS TOOK PLACE OVER THE

KIDNAPPED LIBERAL DEPUTY DARIO QUINTERO PATINO, 42, IN THE DOWNTOWN
SECTION OF AGUACHICA MUNICIPALITY.  NEWSMAN EMILIANO J. PACHECO, WHO

HIS WAY TO FRAGUAS CORREGIMIENTO IN REMEDIOS, ANTIOQUIA, TO CASH A
CHECK.

   THE AUTHORITIES AND SECRET SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ANNOUNCED THAT
INTENSIVE OPERATIONS ARE UNDERWAY IN AN EFFORT TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES
ALIVE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY URGED LOCAL OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL
LEADERS TO REFRAIN FROM TRAVELLING ALONE TO AVOID FALLING INTO THE
HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   WITH THIS SHOCKING WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS, THE NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS
IN COLOMBIA SO FAR IN 1990 HAS INCREASED TO 120.

COMMAND OF THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT] [TEXT] ONE MILITARY
HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN TODAY WHILE ANOTHER ONE WAS DAMAGED IN
QUEBRANDA HONDA NEAR CHALATENANGO CITY.  THEREFORE, THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WISHES TO INFORM OUR
PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT CLASH TOOK PLACE DURING A MILITARY OPERATION
WHICH THE DM-1 [MILITARY DETACHMENT 1] IS CARRYING OUT IN THAT SECTOR.

   2.  EARLY IN THE MORNING WE FOUGHT WITH DM-1 TROOPS, WHO WERE
SUPPORTED BY SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.

   3.  WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, OUR ANTI-AIRCRAFT UNITS FIRED ON TWO
MILITARY HELICOPTERS THAT HAD FIRED ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNNED THE
AREA.  OUR UNITS SHOT DOWN ONE AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED ANOTHER
HELICOPTER.

   4.  THESE ACTIONS TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CAPITAL OF CHALATENANGO
DEPARTMENT, AND NOT NEAR THE GUANCORA LAND SETTLEMENT.

   5.  LATER, WE LEARNED FROM PUBLIC REPORTS THAT ONE OF THE
HELICOPTERS WAS CARRYING A TEAM OF JOURNALISTS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO ALONG WITH THE TROOPS.  TO THAT EFFECT, WE REGRET
THE INJURIES INFLICTED ON THE JOURNALISTS, TO WHOM WE REITERATE OUR
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT TRAVEL ON ANY MILITARY VEHICLES OR
AIRCRAFT.  WE EXTEND THIS WARNING TO ALL CIVILIANS AND GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.

COLORADO WAS ONE OF THE PASSENGERS, OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE NOTED,
ADDING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS UNHURT.

   ACCORDING TO THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA), MEMBERS OF

TODAY THAT FIGHTING BROKE OUT ON THE NIGHT OF 5 MARCH IN THE WAR-TORN
CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
GUERRILLAS SUFFERED EIGHT CASUALTIES.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE CLASHES TOOK
PLACE NEAR SAN ISIDRO LABRADOR, WHERE THREE GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED AND
FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), WHICH HAS
BEEN FIGHTING THE U.S.-BACKED ARMY FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, HAS
TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED A HIGH PROFILE IN STRATEGIC AREAS OF
CHALATENANGO.

   MEANWHILE, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS HARASSED TROOPS BELONGING TO
THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE LAST NIGHT AT THE MARIONA PENITENTIARY,
LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, APPARENTLY LEAVING
NO CASUALTIES.

   ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS, WHICH MAINTAIN A COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF GUAZAPA HILL, TO THE NORTH OF SAN
SALVADOR, CONFISCATED WAR MATERIEL THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAD HIDDEN
UNDERGROUND.

   IN ANOTHER TURN OF EVENTS, FMLN SAPPERS WHO CONTINUOUSLY SABOTAGE
THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM DESTROYED SEVERAL HIGH-VOLTAGE POSTS IN LA
LIBERTAD AND CABANAS DEPARTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY,
AND IN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.

   THERE WERE WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES IN THE THREE DEPARTMENTS WHILE
TECHNICIANS OF THE STATE-RUN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANIES REPAIRED THE
DAMAGE.

   THE ARMY AND SECURITY CORPS DEPLOYED HEAVY PATROLS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND IN CITIES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR TO TRY AND COUNTER THE WAVE OF
ATTACKS.  


DEV-MUC3-1154 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 6 MAR 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] NOW, JUST LIKE
13 YEARS AGO WHEN A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION WAS INSTALLED IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE PARTICULARLY
TENSE, AND TODAY, JUST LIKE THEN, THE REASON FOR THE TENSION IN THEIR
BILATERAL RELATIONS IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE BUSH, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT OF VINICIO CEREZO DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH POLITICAL WILL TO
NEUTRALIZE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF CITIZENS AND
INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES.

   IN MARCH 1977, NEWLY INSTALLED U.S. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DEMANDED
THAT THE REGIME HEADED BY GENERAL KJELL LAUGERUD RECTIFY A DOMESTIC
POLICY THAT, ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
REPRESSIVE PRACTICES AGAINST THE OPPOSITION AND PEASANT AND LABOR
GROUPS.  THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES REACTED BY REJECTING U.S.
MILITARY AID.  THE SAME POSITION WAS ADOPTED, AMID VERY SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, BY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS OF JORGE VIDELA IN
ARGENTINA AND AUGUSTO PINOCHET IN CHILE.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND WASHINGTON CONTINUED TO BE TORTUOUS
DURING THE BALANCE OF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION AND ONLY IMPROVED,
RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WHEN REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN TOOK OFFICE IN
1981.  HOWEVER, ONLY YEARS LATER -- WITH THE COMMITMENT TO
DEMOCRATIZATION BY DE FACTO MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT LED THE COUNTRY
FROM 1982 AND 1985 -- WAS THERE A CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE BETWEEN
GUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES THAT BROUGHT ABOUT QUITE HARMONIOUS
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENTS
REAGAN AND BUSH UNTIL MID-1989.

   ON 27 FEBRUARY U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK CRITICIZED THE
GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' FAILURE TO PURSUE THE AUTHORS OF MURDERS AND
OF KIDNAPPINGS OF POLITICAL, STUDENT, AND LABOR LEADERS, AND THUS
WORSENED AN ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION THAT HAD RESURFACED ABOUT SIX
MONTHS AGO WHEN AMBASSADOR STROOK, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA,
OBJECTED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONEL HUGO MORAN CARRANZA, FORMER
DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL, TO THE POST OF MANAGER OF THE
SANTO TOMAS DE CASTILLA PORT ENTERPRISE.  THE AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED HIS
OBJECTION BY CLAIMING THAT ASPECTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL DRUG
TRAFFICKING HAD TO BE RESOLVED FIRST.

   ON 6 MARCH, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD
HARDENED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GUATEMALAN REGIME AND THAT THIS
ATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH A TOLERANT POSTURE EXHIBITED TOWARD PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIONS IN GUATEMALA:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] THEY HAVE HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE COURTS
SITUATION.  THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AS A
RESULT OF THE UN ACTION A DRAFT PROCEDURAL LAW WILL BE SUBMITTED.
THIS SHOULD BE APPROVED AND PROCEEDINGS SHOULD IMPROVE IN GUATEMALA IN
ABOUT [WORD INDISTINCT] YEARS.

   HOWEVER, WE ARE DEALING WITH LONG-TERM EFFORT.  WE HAVE MADE
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES FOR ONLY FOUR YEARS.  I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT
THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD A COUNTRY THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO MOVE
FORWARD IS UNFAIR AND OVERLY CRITICAL.  IT IS BEING MORE CRITICAL OF
THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT THAN IT EVER WAS TOWARD PAST
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY HARSHER IN
CRITICIZING THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT]
DEMOCRACY THAN PAST DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TO WHICH THE UNITED
STATES, IN CERTAIN CASES, WAS AN ACCOMPLICE BY SAYING NOTHING [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  [END RECORDING]

   ONLY HOURS AFTER THE PRESIDENT MADE THESE STATEMENTS, THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN GUATEMALA ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES ABSTAINED FROM VOICING ITS CONCERN OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, IT
WOULD INDEED BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE.  THE COMMUNIQUE CITES
STATEMENTS MADE ON 5 MARCH IN WASHINGTON BY STATE DEPARTMENT
SPOKESWOMAN MARGARET TUTWILLER THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR STROOK, IN HIS
CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, HAS ON MANY
OCCASIONS TOLD TOP GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THAT
THOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS MUST BE TURNED OVER TO JUSTICE.

   STROOK IS CURRENTLY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS RECALLED BY THE
STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSULTATIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE DIPLOMATIC
MISSION, THE AMBASSADOR'S STATEMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE PERMANENT
U.S. POSITION OF CONSIDERING HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE
TREATED AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1155 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SANTIAGO, 6 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PATRICIO
AYLWIN TODAY CONDITIONED THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH CUBA TO THAT COUNTRY'S SUSPENSION OF ITS MILITARY, POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO CHILE'S MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR)
TERRORIST GROUP. IN REMARKS TO EFE, AYLWIN EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION
OVER THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION ON 11 MARCH. HE ALSO NOTED THAT LA PAZ MUST
FIRST RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHILE TO HOLD TALKS ON
BOLIVIA'S DESIRE FOR AN OUTLET TO THE SEA.

   AYLWIN STATED THAT CUBA'S SUSPENSION OF ITS SUPPORT TO THE FPMR IS
"A SINE QUA NON CONDITION" FOR RESUMING RELATIONS, WHICH WERE SEVERED
IN 1973 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MILITARY COUP IN CHILE. "WE WANT TO
MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH EVERY COUNTRY," THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT-ELECT
TOLD EFE.  HE ADDED: "IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR LATIN AMERICA IF CUBA
COULD EFFECTIVELY REJOIN US AT THIS TIME (...) IN WHICH, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MANY YEARS, PERHAPS IN DECADES, THERE WILL BE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT."

   AYLWIN ADDED: "WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK CUBA TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR
THAT IT WILL REFRAIN FROM ANY ACT OF INTERFERENCE AND FROM SUPPLYING
ANY AID TO CHILEAN TERRORIST GROUPS."

   THE FPMR, WHICH EMERGED IN DECEMBER 1983, IS MADE UP OF MILITANTS
FROM COMMUNIST YOUTH GROUPS AND OTHER EXTREME LEFT ORGANIZATIONS AND
YOUNG EXILES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY.  THE FPMR MADE
HEADLINES IN AUGUST 1986 WITH THE DISCOVERY OF AN ARSENAL THAT HAD
BEEN CLANDESTINELY SHIPPED INTO NORTHERN CHILE.  THE FPMR WAS ALSO IN
THE NEWS WITH THE UNSUCCESSFUL 7 SEPTEMBER 1986 ATTACK ON CHILE'S
CHIEF EXECUTIVE, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET, WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF
FIVE OF PINOCHET'S BODYGUARDS.

   AYLWIN ALSO STATED THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH
BOLIVIA "IS BLOCKED BY THE BOLIVIAN DECISION TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH
OUR COUNTRY."  COMMENTING ON BOLIVIA'S ASPIRATION FOR AN OUTLET TO THE
SEA, AYLWIN SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT CONDITIONS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT
OF RELATIONS.  IF WE HAVE RELATIONS, WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING AND
FIND SOLUTIONS TO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS."  AYLWIN CONTINUED: "IF WE DO
NOT MAINTAIN RELATIONS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE."

   AYLWIN ALSO COMMENTED ON PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S DECISION
TO ATTEND THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION.  THIS WILL BE THE
FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 100 YEARS (SINCE THE 1879 WAR OF THE PACIFIC
IN WHICH CHILE FOUGHT AGAINST PERU AND BOLIVIA) THAT A PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT WILL VISIT CHILE, A GESTURE WITH "HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE" FOR
AYLWIN.

   THE LEGACY OF THE CHILEAN-PERUVIAN WAR HAS NOT YET DISAPPEARED
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES SHARE COMMON INTERESTS AND
HAVE MAINTAINED FRIENDLY RELATIONS IN RECENT YEARS. AYLWIN DESCRIBED
THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO ATTEND HIS INAUGURATION "AS A GESTURE
WHICH, IN ADDITION TO GREATLY HONORING ME, I MUST SEE AS VERY
PROMISING FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES."

   [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] COUNTRY IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE "IN EVERY
STAGE." COMMENTING SPECIFICALLY ON THE GROUP OF EIGHT, AYLWIN NOTED
THAT THIS GROUP MAY BECOME A LARGER LATIN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION.  IN
AYLWIN'S OPINION, THE GROUP OF EIGHT -- WHICH IS MADE UP OF ARGENTINA,
BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, VENEZUELA, AND PANAMA (WHICH
IS CURRENTLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF ITS DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION) --
EMERGED PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS IN SOME LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

   NOW THAT DEMOCRACY HAS SPREAD TO VIRTUALLY ALL LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, THE GROUP OF EIGHT COULD BECOME "THE SEED FOR A BROADER
ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE THE REASONS THAT PREVENTED OTHER COUNTRIES FROM
JOINING HAVE GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED."

   BOGOTA, 8 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), ONE
OF THE MAIN COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS, DELIVERED THEIR WEAPONS
TODAY TO A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL (IS) SPECIAL COMMISSION AT THE M-19
CAMP LOCATED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWESTERN COLOMBIA.  THE DELIVERY
BEGAN AT 1030 LOCAL TIME (1530 GMT) AND PROCEEDED FOR A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE PRESS WAS PERMITTED ACCESS TO THE CAMP.

   THE DELIVERY OF THE WEAPONS, WITH WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP HAS
FOUGHT DURING THE PAST 16 YEARS, TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE
POLITICAL PACT OR THE DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT BY THE M-19 AND
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT WAS SIGNED.

   BEFORE SURRENDERING THEIR WEAPONS, THE M-19 GUERRILLAS SHOT THEM
INTO THE AIR FOR THE LAST TIME.  THEN THEY GAVE THEIR WEAPONS TO THEIR
TOP LEADER, CARLOS PIZARRO, WHO DELIVERED THEM TO THE IS COMMISSION,
MADE UP OF VENEZUELAN, SWISS, BRITISH, AND FINNISH MILITARY PERSONNEL.

   THE IS COMMISSION, A PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVE, 600 M-19 MEMBERS,
AND OVER 200 LOCAL AND FOREIGN NEWSMEN WITNESSED THE WEAPON DELIVERY

DEV-MUC3-1157 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] HERE IS AN EXCERPT
OF WHAT AN OFFICIAL REPORT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE, ARENA, REGARD AS A COMPLETELY RECKLESS PUBLICATION AND WITHOUT ANY
CREDIBILITY.

   THE COMMUNIQUE IS BY THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, AND AN EXCERPT OF
IT RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO THROUGH VARIOUS LOCAL AND FOREIGN MEDIA
READS AS FOLLOWS:

   TO THE NEWS MEDIA, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, UNIONS,
WORKERS, PEASANT ORGANIZATIONS, AND DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS: THE
UNDERSIGNED, SUPREME COMMANDERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS WHO MET ON 13
FEBRUARY SOMEWHERE IN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND
WHO REPRESENT ALL OUR CHAPTERS AND CADRES SCATTERED IN THE COUNTRY'S
14 DEPARTMENTS, STRONGLY AND MANFULLLY DECLARE: SENTENCE UNFINISHED AS
HEARD

   THE DOCUMENT, WITH PARAGRAPHS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUTHORS, STATES
THAT THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDERS
MUST BE RELEASED BEFORE HOLY WEEK, OR ELSE THEY WILL PHYSICALLY
ELIMINATE ALL CIVILIAN AND RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE
GOVERNMENT, WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE.

   THE COMMUNIQUE NOTES: NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR
HAS ANY OFFICER BEEN TRIED, AND AS WE HAVE LEARNED, NO SOLDIER HAS
BEEN, AND MUST NOT BE, SUBJECT TO ANY LAW OF THE REPUBLIC.  IT ADDS:
KEEP IN MIND, LEST WE BEGIN TO CARRY OUT REPRISALS, THAT THROUGHOUT
OUR HISTORY WE HAVE ALWAYS GONE UNPUNISHED, A PRIVILEGE THAT WE ARE
NOT READY TO LOSE.

   A STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA, WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THE
COMMUNIQUE, TOTALLY REJECTED THE DOCUMENT THAT, WE REPEAT, WAS
DISTRIBUTED IN SAN SALVADOR A FEW HOURS AGO.  IN A WARNING TO THE NEWS
MEDIA, THE AUTHORS SAY THAT THE MEDIA ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THIS
COMMUNIQUE KNOWN, OR ELSE THEIR INSTALLATIONS AND STAFF WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DISOBEDIENCE.  THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE
ALSO REFER TO A NEWSPAPER THAT THEY REGARD AS THEIR OFFICIAL
MOUTHPIECE, AND THEY WARN THAT, FOR THE GOOD AND SECURITY OF THE
COUNTRY AND THE FATHERLAND, THIS NEWSPAPER MUST BE CLEARER IN
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE AND FIGURES WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN JUDGED AND
CONDEMNED IN ORDER TO CAPTURE AND DESTROY THEM.

   MEANWHILE, TERMING THE COMMUNIQUE AS RECKLESS AND THE ENTIRE
SITUATION AS DESPICABLE, THE GOVERNMENT AND ARENA REJECT ANY TIES TO
ANY DEATH SQUADS.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY THE SELF-STYLED DEATH SQUADS IS SIGNED BY AQUILES
BAIRES [LEADER OF THE SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY], THE MAXIMILIANO
HERNANDEZ MARTINEZ SQUAD [ESCUADRON MAXIMILIANIO HERNANDEZ MARTINEZ],
THE ALLIANCE OF ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION [ALIANZA DE ACCION

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] GOOD EVENING,
LISTENERS.  IN ORDER TO BRING CALM TO ALL SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTS, AND ALSO
TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, WE INFORM YOU THAT A FEW
MINUTES AGO, EXPERTS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY OF EL SALVADOR, CAES,
CONFIRMED THAT DESPITE A FEW ATTACKS ON SOME POWER TOWERS, ENERGY SERVICE IS
COMPLETELY NORMAL THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR.  THE CAES EXPERTS ADDED THAT
THERE WAS A SHORT POWER OUTAGE IN LARGE PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT THAT THE
SITUATION IS BACK TO NORMAL NOW.  THE EXPERTS SAID THAT THEY ALSO DETECTED
SOME DAMAGE IN THE ENERGY SYSTEM.

   AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ON THIS RADIO STATION EARLIER, HARASSMENT
OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR AT
APPROXIMATELY 2115 TONIGHT.

   FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] LEFTIST GUERRILLAS
ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN RAMON, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, MEJICANOS,
AND CUSCATANCINGO TONIGHT.  IT WAS SAID THAT A NUMBER OF FMLN MEMBERS
CONDUCTED LIGHTNING ATTACKS ON THOSE MILITARY POSITIONS AND THEN
WITHDREW FROM THE AREA IMMEDIATELY.

   IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE ATTACK IN SAN RAMON LASTED APPROXIMATELY
15 MINUTES, AFTER WHICH THE ARMY TOOK CONTROL OF THAT ENTIRE AREA.
REPORTS STATE THAT AFTER THE ATTACK IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE THE GUERRILLAS
MOVED TOWARD EL CARMEN HILL AND COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION MEMBERS
WERE PURSUING THE REBEL COLUMNS THERE.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
REBELS ATTACKED MILITARY POSITIONS IN CUSCATANCINGO AND ON EL FITO
STREET, MEJICANOS JURISDICTION.

   A FEW MINUTES AGO IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SHOOTING ENDED IN
AYUTUXTEPEQUE AND IN THE OTHER PARTS OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AND
THAT AN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER IS OVERFLYING THE AREA TO COUNTERACT THE
REBELS' MOVEMENT.

   IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT ENERGY HAS BEEN RESTORED IN SOME PARTS
OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT IN CUSCATANCINGO AND CIUDAD DELGADO, WHERE
THE GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL POWER TOWERS.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE [COPREFA] HAS ONLY STATED THAT NO
CASUALTIES ARE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THESE HARASSMENT OPERATIONS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  COPREFA INDICATED THAT 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STRATEGIC POSITIONS
THROUGHOUT NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AND THAT THESE MEN ARE SUPPORTED BY
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS, WHICH ARE LIGHTING THE AREA WITH
SPOTLIGHTS AND FLARES.

   ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT, THE SITUATION AT THIS TIME IS
COMPLETELY NORMAL IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, DESPITE THE PANIC THAT
SPREAD AT APPROXIMATELY 2115 WHEN HEAVY SHOOTING, MACHINEGUN FIRE, AND
THE DETONATION OF POWERFUL BOMBS WERE HEARD.

   NEITHER COPREFA NOR THE SPECIFIC MILITARY POSITIONS THAT WERE
ATTACKED HAVE REPORTED CASUALTIES SO FAR.  IT WAS SAID THAT TOMORROW
MORNING COPREFA WILL ISSUE AN OVERALL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THESE
CLASHES.  SALVADORAN RED CROSS SOURCES SAID TONIGHT THAT THEY DO NOT
KNOW OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTY RESULTING FROM THESE ARMED INCIDENTS.

   THIS HAS BEEN A REPORT ON THE ATTACKS CARRIED OUT IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR TONIGHT.  WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US TOMORROW FOR A REPORT ON
THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS.  


DEV-MUC3-1159 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI HAS ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF MAINTAINING "INFLEXIBLE
STANDS" REGARDING RESUMING THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL ALLOW ENDING THE
10-YEAR-OLD ARMED CONFLICT.

   IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT TODAY, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT "THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) DOES NOT WANT TO
LISTEN TO THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REJECTING VIOLENCE."

   FOR CRISTIANI, THE FMLN "IS THE ONLY PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS IT MAINTAINS INFLEXIBLE STANDS" ABOUT THE PEACE
PROCESS.

   THE REBELS, WHO ROSE UP IN ARMS 10 YEARS AGO, RECENTLY SAID THAT AS
LONG AS THERE IS NO TRUE ATTEMPT TO BRING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIZATION, ITS
ARMED STRUGGLE "CONTINUES BEING AS LEGITIMATE AS IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO."

   FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 1989 OFFENSIVE, THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN ASKED UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR TO
INTERCEDE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL BRING ABOUT THE PEACE TALKS.

   HEEDING THIS REQUEST, PEREZ DE CUELLAR APPOINTED DIPLOMAT ALVARO DE
SOTO AS HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE.  AS OF LAST DECEMBER, DE SOTO HAS
BEEN MEETING WITH BOTH PARTIES, THE CHURCH, AND SALVADORAN POLITICAL
SECTORS.

   THE CRISTIANI STATEMENT TERMS AS "FALSE" THE CHARGES RAISED BY THE
FMLN TO THE EFFECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HINDERING
THE RESUMPTION OF THE PEACE EFFORTS.

   "PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS REITERATED TO MR. DE SOTO A TRUE
WILLINGNESS TO SEEK THROUGH A SERIOUS DIALOGUE AND NOT A TACTICAL OR
MUCH LESS PROPAGANDISTIC DIALOGUE THE SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT,"
THE DOCUMENT POINTS OUT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT THANKED DE SOTO'S "INTEREST AND HARD
WORK" IN COMPLYING WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S COMMITMENT OF
SEEKING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY.

THEY BROKE UP A REBEL COLUMN THAT OPERATED IN BOTH COUNTRIES.

   THE MILITARY OPERATIVE LED TO THE CAPTURE OF 12 ELN MEMBERS WHO HAD
KIDNAPPED SEVERAL CATTLE BREEDERS AND PROPERTY-OWNERS IN THE BORDER

JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE (PTJ), WHILE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES CAPTURED
11 OTHERS IN THE EASTERN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT.

   THE ELN, THE MOST RADICAL OF ALL THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN
COLOMBIA, HAS THREATENED TO SABOTAGE NEXT SUNDAY'S MUNICIPAL AND
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ELN FRONTS HAVE KIDNAPPED SEVERAL MAYORS,

COLOMBIA: DRUG KINGPINS SOLE MEMBERS OF 'EXTRADITABLES'

   THE 22 JANUARY EDITION OF THE BOGOTA DAILY EL TIEMPO PUBLISHED
INFORMATION FROM COLOMBIAN POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND STATE
SECURITY INTERCEPTS IDENTIFYING DRUG KINGPINS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE AS THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED
"EXTRADITABLES."  THIS PRESS NOTE PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 22
JANUARY ARTICLE.

   DRUG BARONS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE, WHO
ARE REPUTED TO BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S PLAN TO
SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND STATE SECURITY AS THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COMMUNIQUES SENT BY THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES," ACCORDING TO THE EL
TIEMPO ARTICLE.

   STATE SECURITY RECOGNI ED ESCOBAR'S VOICE IN A CONVERSATION
INTERCEPTED DURING A ROUTINE RADIO SCANNING OPERATION, WHICH REVEALED
THAT THE CARTEL WAS PLANNING TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ESCOBAR
WAS ACTING AS THE CARTEL'S INTERMEDIARY IN CHARGE OF CONTACTING LAWYER
GUIDO PARRA, THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE CARTEL AND HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.  ESCOBAR DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS
INVOLVED.

   A NATIONAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS THAT OCHOA AND ESCOBAR
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE OTHER TRAFFICKER
GROUPS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS THEY HAVE NOT
PERPETRATED.  THE REPORT FURTHER INDICATES THAT ESCOBAR, PRESSURED BY
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ANTIOQUIA, "WAS FORCED TO ORDER THE KIDNAPPINGS
OF ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA, (SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
PRESIDENCY) AND PATRICIA ECHEVARRIA (SISTER OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S
SON-IN-LAW) AND HER DAUGHTER."  THESE HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES SERVED AS
A "PROTECTIVE SHIELD," ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.

   SPOKESMEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE CORPS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT
ESCOBAR KNEW THAT BY TAKING HOSTAGE THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL
OF THE PRESIDENCY, HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY EXERT THE PRESSURE HE NEEDED
TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  PROBLEMS BEGAN TO SURFACE
SOON AFTER THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER, AS MEMBERS AT ODDS WITH ESCOBAR
STARTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE GROUP.  ACCORDING TO MEDELLIN
OFFICIALS, THE KIDNAPPINGS OF MONTOYA AND ECHEVARRIA ALSO HAD AN
IMPACT ON THE RATE OF ATTRITION AMONG THE "EXTRADITABLES.

   THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER IS NOT SEEN AS A SURPRISE: THE 4TH ARMY
BRIGADE WAS CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF THE ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE KINGPINS TO JUSTICE.  MOREOVER,
THE ARMY LAUNCHED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AMONG THE LOCALS TO ENCOURAGE
THEM TO INFORM AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF
JOSE GON ALO RODRIGUE GACHA, ESCOBAR AND OCHOA WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE
MOVE.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR STATE SECURITY STATES THAT SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN MEDELLIN ENABLED THEM TO LEARN ABOUT
ESCOBAR'S INTENTIONS ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
ESTABLISH THEIR EXACT WHEREABOUTS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY NEVER
REMAINED IN ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS AT A TIME.  THE TWO DRUG
BARONS ALWAYS TRAVELED WITH AN ESCORT OF SIX TO EIGHT MEN WHOM THEY
TRUSTED IMPLICITLY.

   ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, "WHEN ESCOBAR BEGAN
LOSING POWER IN MEDELLIN, HIS CLOSEST AIDES, FEARING PERSECUTION, WENT
INTO HIDING."  HE ADDS THAT ESCOBAR AND OCHOA TOOK ON THE CAUSE OF
TRAFFICKERS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT NOTES, "WE ARE WELL AWARE
OF THE FACT THAT THE CALI CARTEL MEN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY."

   THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE NOTES THAT ON 19 JANUARY SEVERAL LEADING
COLOMBIAN NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED A NOTICE POINTING TO ESCOBAR AS THE
MAN WHO ACTS IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  LATER, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE NOTICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A
DEMENTED PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD CLEARLY BEEN USED.  EL TIEMPO ASKS:.
"COULD THIS BE A MESSAGE FROM OTHER DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE UNWILLING
TO PAY FOR PABLO ESCOBAR'S ACTIONS?  COULD IT BE A MESSAGE FROM THESE
SAME TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUSINESS AND
THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE ESCOBAR AND OCHOA SPEAK FOR THEM?"

FORMER COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE CHILEAN NAVY, TODAY HARSHLY ATTACKED
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AND NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF 11 PRESIDENTS WHO WILL
BE IN CHILE FOR AYLWIN'S INAUGURATION WILL SALUTE CURRENT PRESIDENT
GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET ON SATURDAY, MERINO SAID: "WE HAVE ALL KINDS
OF THEM. I WILL NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH THAT MAN GARCIA FROM PERU. HE IS
FILTHY [MUGRIENTO]."  THE ADMIRAL CONTINUED: "NEITHER WILL I SHAKE
HANDS WITH A GRIMY PERSON WHO HAS KILLED ANY NUMBER OF PATRIOTS AND
WHO IS CREATING TROUBLE FOR THAT LADY...WHAT IS HER NAME?...CHAMORRO."
MERINO WAS REFERRING TO ORTEGA, WHO WILL ARRIVE IN SANTIAGO ON SUNDAY.

   MERINO, WHO RETIRED AFTER 16 YEARS AS NAVY COMMANDER IN CHIEF, MADE
THESE REMARKS AFTER A GOVERNMENT JUNTA FAREWELL SESSION. THE
GOVERNMENT JUNTA HAS FUNCTIONED AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SINCE 1973.

   MERINO SAID: "SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO SHAKE THE PRESIDENT'S
HAND COME FROM WRETCHED COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF HUNGER,
COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING DESPERATE INFLATION AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS.
THEY ARE PROPERLY REPRESENTED [SON UNOS PUEBLOS TALES POR CUALES]."

   MOSCOW (USSR), 11 MAR 11 (TASS) -- [ARTICLE] [GENNADIY PETROV] [TEXT]
AFTER STAYING IN POWER FOR 16 YEARS, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET WAS FINALLY
COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE LA MONEDA PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, WHICH HE CAPTURED
DURING THE MILITARY COUP OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1973.

   LAWYER PATRICIO AYLWIN, 71, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC
PARTY, BECAME ITS NEW MASTER TODAY.  HE SCORED A SWEEPING VICTORY
DURING DECEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTIONS WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE
OPPOSITION PARTIES, INCLUDING COMMUNISTS.

   THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE WILL BY NO MEANS BE EASY.
BOMB EXPLOSIONS SHOOK THE CAPITAL ON THE EVE OF THE INAUGURATION
CEREMONY AS MILITANTS REMINDED THE PUBLIC OF THEIR PRESENCE.

   ACCORDING TO AYLWIN, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME
THE DEEP POLITICAL DIVISION OF CHILEAN SOCIETY.  "ONLY THIS," AYLWIN
BELIEVES, "WILL ALLOW CHILE TO DO AWAY WITH VESTIGES OF THE
TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY EXPAND PARLIAMENT'S POWERS, TO
AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNFAIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND TO LEGALISE
BANNED PARTIES.

   ANALYSTS BELIEVE THE REVIVAL OF CHILE, WHICH HAS LONG-STANDING
DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS, WILL BE HELD BACK BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING
TO THE CONSTITUTION IN FORCE, PINOCHET WILL REMAIN COMMANDER-IN- CHIEF
OF THE GROUND FORCES FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS.  THIS SUBSTANTIALLY
CURTAILS THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHTS AS SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE COUNTRY'S
ARMED FORCES.  FURTHERMORE, BEFORE STEPPING DOWN, THE FORMER RULER HAS
ENSURED HIMSELF AN OBEDIENT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, THE CHILEAN
PARLIAMENT'S UPPER CHAMBER.

   IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME
THE ISOLATION THAT RESULTED FROM THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, WHEN HUMAN
RIGHTS WERE GROSSLY VIOLATED AND THOUSANDS OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS WERE
RUTHLESSLY PERSECUTED OR ELIMINATED.  THIS TASK IS FACILITATED BY THE
FACT THAT RELAXATION PROCESSES ARE GAINING MOMENTUM IN THE WORLD AND
EAST-WEST COOPERATION IS ON THE UPSWING.

   NUMEROUS FOREIGN GUESTS, INCLUDING A SOVIET DELEGATION, ARRIVED FOR
THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY AND THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO A CIVILIAN
GOVERNMENT.  AN AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE SIGNED THESE DAYS ON THE
RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND CHILE
AND ON THE OPENING OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMBASSIES IN MOSCOW AND
SANTIAGO.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 14 MAR 90 (EL SIGLO) -- [TEXT] A BAND OF
COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE INVADED THE VERACRUZ
COMMUNITY IN THE ARRAIJAN DISTRICT.  ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE
THIS REPORT, THE CRIMINALS ARE WELL-ARMED AND APPARENTLY, WILLING TO
FIGHT TO THE END TO MAINTAIN THE CRIMINAL RING, LEFT TO THEM BY FORMER
DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA.

   "THEY HAVE WEAPONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES USED BY THE MURDERING
DIGNITY BATTALIONS' IN THEIR PRACTICES AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED MANY
LATE NIGHT VISITS; SOME NEIGHBORS SAY THEY ALSO SELL DRUGS," SAID A
VERACRUZ RESIDENT WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR FEAR OF
RETALIATION BY THE COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS.

   THE CHARGES PRESENTED BY VERACRUZ RESIDENTS MAY RESULT IN ANOTHER
POLICE OPERATION THAT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, ELIMINATE ALL THE BANDS
OF ARMED ASSAILANTS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WERE ARMED IN THE PAST BY
MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA DICTATORSHIP.  THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF
THIS SITUATION IS THE RUMORS IN THE CORREGIMIENTO THAT MANY
COLOMBIANS, WHO ESCAPED FROM THE RECENT POLICE OPERATION IN CURUNDU,
HAVE HIDDEN IN VERACRUZ AND THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THERE IS A
FEARLESS ARMY OF CRIMINALS MADE UP OF PANAMANIANS AND UNDOCUMENTED
COLOMBIANS.  [CONTINUED]

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), NO DATE (RADIO KW CONTINENTE) -- [INTERVIEW
WITH ENDARA BY MONTANER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ENDARA] THERE WAS NOTHING
REMOTELY CLOSE TO A TRIAL HELD, EVEN IF WE HAD THE DEATH PENALTY AS A
PUNISHMENT FOR MILITARY CRIMES.  THEY WERE ASSASSINS OF THE WORST
KIND.  THERE WERE OTHER PREVIOUS INCIDENTS, BUT BASICALLY THIS IS THE
ACCUSATION.

   [MONTANER] OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI'S DEATH?

   [ENDARA] GIROLDI AND MANY OTHERS.  MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED DURING
THOSE DAYS.  WE DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   [MONTANER] YOU DO NOT KNOW?

   [ENDARA] WE DO NOT KNOW.

   [MONTANER] ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM LEAVE?  ARE YOU GOING TO LET
THEM ESCAPE TO PERU?

   [ENDARA] LOOK, AS A LAWYER I KNOW WHAT LATIN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES SAY -- THOSE THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY THE
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT RATIFIED
THEM -- REGARDING THE RIGHT TO ASYLUM.  THE HOST COUNTRY DECIDES WHAT
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED, NOT THE HOME COUNTRY.  THERE ARE RIGHTS
ESTABLISHED IN THOSE TREATIES.  THE HOME COUNTRY MAY INQUIRE ABOUT THE
CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT
REFUGE.  THE HOME COUNTRY MAY ASK THE HOST COUNTRY NOT TO DETERMINE
WHAT CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN EACH CASE.  IF THE HOST COUNTRY HAS
ALREADY DECIDED ON THE CHARGES, IT MAY BE ASKED BY THE HOME COUNTRY TO
RECONSIDER ITS DECISION AND TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THOSE
CHARGES.  WE ARE CURRENTLY EXERCISING THOSE RIGHTS.

   WE HOPE PERU DOES NOT INSIST BECAUSE OUR RELATIONS, AS YOU HAVE
ALREADY SEEN [CHANGES THOUGHT] THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING OTHER CASES,
WHICH ARE LESS SERIOUS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE CASE OF A MAN LIKE
TOTY SUAREZ [PRESIDENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PANAMENIST PARTY, PRD]; WE
HAVE THE CASE OF GENERAL NORIEGA'S WIFE AND DAUGHTERS; AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER CASES WHERE WE CANNOT CALL THESE PEOPLE ASSASINS.  WE DID NOT
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM.

   [MONTANER] WHAT ABOUT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA?

   [ENDARA] SOLIS PALMA LEFT THE EMBASSY AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM.
HIS CASE WAS INTERESTING.  HE SOUGHT ASYLUM AND THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY
NEVER, NEVER, OFFICIALLY INFORMED THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT THAT SOLIS
PALMA WAS THERE.

   [MONTANER] HE WAS THERE AS A GUEST?

   [ENDARA] YES.  WHEN WE WERE ASKED ABOUT THE FATE OF SOLIS PALMA, WE
REPLIED THAT, FOR ALL WE KNEW, HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS WITH THE
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR.  HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO SLEEP THERE.

   [MONTANER] I WILL ASK A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

   [ENDARA] YOU MAY ASK ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

   [MONTANER] THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE INVASION WAS A
U.S. PRETEXT NOT TO RETURN THE CANAL IN THE YEAR 2000.

   [ENDARA] NO, NO.  THERE HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT FROM
ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, NOT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE
ARMY ABOUT THIS.  CONGRESSMEN OF ALL IDEOLOGIES HAVE BEEN HERE, EVEN
FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT -- I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE ANY EXTREME LEFTIST
CONGRESSMEN IN THE UNITED STATES -- AS WELL AS SENATORS.  MILITARY
OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN HERE.  I HAVE HAD LONG TALKS WITH THEM.  THEY
HAVE NOT EVEN HINTED THAT THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE TREATIES OR THAT
THEY WANT TO STAY BEYOND THE YEAR 2000.  ALL OF THAT IS NORIEGA'S
NONSENSE.  NORIEGA WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED THAT CAMPAIGN.  THERE HAS
NEVER BEEN ANY TALK ABOUT THIS, NOT EVEN ABOUT THE BASES REMAINING
BEYOND THE YEAR 2000.  THERE HAS BEEN NONE OF THAT AT ALL.  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, 16 MAR 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT]
THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] DEEMS AS POSITIVE THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNITION OF THE FMLN'S
GOOD-WILL GESTURES.  HOWEVER, WE VIEW AS A NEGATIVE THAT IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE THERE IS NOT A CORRESPONDING ATTITUDE. IN THIS
REGARD, WE INFORM:

   1.  THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRIES TO UNDERMINE OUR GESTURE.  THE
FMLN HAS NEVER HAD A POLICY TO ATTACK OR HARM THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
OUR GESTURES ARE A CLEAR CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING THE SPACE OF
OTHER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO ALLOW FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN
THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATION SOLUTION PROCESS AND IN THE EFFORT TO
HUMANIZE THE CONFLICT.

   2.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES CONTINUE TO VIOLATE HUMAN
RIGHTS, BOMB CIVILIAN POPULATED AREAS, SUBJECT THE COUNTRY TO A
PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE, BE IT LEGAL OR DE FACTO.  IN A CONSTANT AND
SYSTEMATIC MANNER, THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS A POLICY OF CAPTURING AND
TORTURING LEADERS OF PEOPLE'S GROUPS; MAINTAINS SIEGES AND RAIDS;
HARASSES THE COMMUNITIES OF REPATRIATES; AND SABOTAGES THE PROPERTY OF
RESIDENTS IN AREAS UNDER THE FMLN CONTROL.

   IN THE MEANTIME, NO STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH
THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THE MASSACRE OF FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], WHILE THE TRIAL
AGAINST THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAS STAGNATED AND THE
SUSPECTS ARE PROMOTED OR SENT ABROAD.

   THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO APPOINT AS DEFENSE MINISTER THE PERSON
WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO MURDER THE PRIESTS, AND IT ALLOWS THE REPORTED
EXECUTIONER TO LIVE IN A LUXURY APARTMENT.

   3.  WE AGREE WITH THE PERMANENT, SERIOUS, IMPORTANT, AND RESERVED
CHARACTER THAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS SHOULD HAVE.

   4.  THE GOVERNMENT IS MORALLY AND POLITICALLY COMPELLED TO
IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GOODWILL GESTURES THAT WILL PERMIT THE
EXERCISE OF CITIZEN'S FREEDOMS AND CEASE THE DAILY HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND ALL FORMS OF AGGRESSION AIMED AT THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   5.  WE WARN THAT IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE'S PEACE AND
DEMOCRACY HOPES THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TRY TO HARDEN
WARMONGERING POSITIONS, BELIEVING IN THE MIRAGE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS
OF THE FMLN.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS MISTAKE WOULD ONLY LEAD TO A WORSENING
OF THE WAR AND WOULD FURTHER DELAY THE POSSIBILITIES OF NEGOTIATIONS,
DEMOCRATIZATION, AND PEACE FOR EL SALVADOR.

LETTERS, WHICH WERE GOING TO BE USED FOR EXTORTION, AND LARGE AMOUNTS
OF WAR MATERIEL IN CLASHES WITH THE 6TH FARC FRONT IN THE BORDER AREA
OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF VALLE DEL CAUCA AND CAUCA.  IN THE OPERATIONS
THAT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH IN THE JAGUAL AREA IN CORINTO

CORTES, CONSIDERED THE FARC'S MOST IMPORTANT LEADER IN THE
SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  TWO OTHER GUERRILLAS WERE ALSO

THE FARC IS INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING.  AS YOU SAW, THE SEIZURE OF

ACTIVITY.  [END RECORDING]

OPERATION CALLED "LILIANA," THE ARMY SEIZED SHOTGUNS, PISTOLS, ONE

EQUIPMENT, AND CLOTHING FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MILITARY FORCES.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 16 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [SPEECH] [NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] IN SEPTEMBER 1970, I WAS IN JAIL WITH
OTHER COMRADES.  OUR JAILERS DID NOT ALLOW US TO READ THE NEWSPAPERS
-- NOT EVEN THE ONES PUBLISHED BY THE SOMOZAS -- BUT WE FOUND WAYS TO
GET A RADIO AND WERE ABLE TO LEARN OF SALVADOR ALLENDE'S ELECTION
THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S VOTE.

   WE WERE JAIL IN 1973 WHEN WE LEARNED OF THE BRUTAL COUP AGAINST THE
PEOPLE'S WILL AND DEMOCRACY.  RADIO REPORTS SAID THAT PLANES WERE
BOMBING LA MONEDA [CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE] AND WE PICTURED
PRESIDENT ALLENDE HEROICALLY RESISTING THERE.

   WE DID NOT LOSE OUR MORALE.  WE BECAME INDIGNANT AND FULL OF
COURAGE.  WE THOUGHT AND FELT CERTAIN THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD GO
ON WINNING BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR WILL TO BE FREE AND SOVEREIGN.

   SO MANY YEARS HAD TO PASS FOR US TO BE HERE WITH THE CHILEAN
PEOPLE.  AFTER THAT CAME THE VICTORY OF THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA.
THAT DAY, 19 JULY 1979, WHEN THE VICTORIOUS PEOPLE ENTERED MANAGUA,
SALVADOR ALLENDE WAS THERE STRUGGLING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE.

   I WANT TO OUTLINE SOME VIEWS, BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE
CURRENT INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL PICTURE IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX.  FIRST
OF ALL, WE RESPECT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL OPTIONS.  WHEN WE WON, WE
SANDINISTS THOUGHT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO DEVELOP A DIFFERENT
SYSTEM TO GIVE NICARAGUA WHAT HAD BEEN DENIED TO IT BY THE IMPERIALIST
DOMINATION.

   SANDINO EPITOMIZED THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE'S ANTI-IMPERIALIST
STRUGGLE, THE FIRST MANIFESTATIONS OF WHICH OCCURRED LAST CENTURY.
SANDINO ADVOCATED NOT ONLY A STRUGGLE AGAINST NORTH AMERICAN
INTERVENTION, BUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE.  HE DID NOT PUT A LABEL
ON HIS THOUGHTS, BUT WAS CONVINCED THAT TO BE A [TRUE] NICARAGUAN AND
LATIN AMERICAN, ONE HAD TO BE ANTI-IMPERIALIST AND HAD TO ADVOCATE
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE.

   THE SANDINIST FRONT [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] PICKED UP
SANDINO'S BANNERS AND ADOPTED HIS STILL UNFINISHED HISTORICAL PROGRAM.
SO, AFTER VICTORY, WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD TO THINK OF A DIFFERENT
PROGRAM FOR NICARAGUA.

   WE REJECTED DOGMAS OR SCHEMES WITH REGARD TO THE METHOD OF STRUGGLE
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY OR THE MODEL THAT WOULD BE VIABLE FOR NICARAGUA IN
THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT.  WE BEGAN WITH THREE BASIC TENETS: A
MULTIPARTY SYSTEM, A MIXED ECONOMY, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE.

   EXERCISING THIS RIGHT, WE SAID: THIS IS THE PATH.  AND THE UNITED
STATES SAID: THAT IS NOT THE PATH.  TIGHTLY CLINGING TO ITS
IMPERIALISTIC POLICY, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO DESTROY THE
NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION AND ORGANIZED A MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND
ECONOMIC ONSLAUGHT.

   YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS STORY AND ITS TRAGIC TOLL OF 60,000
VICTIMS.

   WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND NICARAGUA AND THE GAINS ATTAINED BY THE
REVOLUTION, BECAUSE THIS DEFENSE WAS HEADED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE
WHO, ARMED WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND COURAGE, TOOK UP WEAPONS TO
DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.  [CONTINUED]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 16 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [SPEECH] [NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES
OFFICE ON 25 APRIL CAN REST ASSURED, AS CAN MANY LATIN AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS, THAT THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER MILITARY COUP IN
NICARAGUA.  THE HUMBLE PEOPLE, THE PEASANTS, AND THE WORKERS CAN REST
ASSURED THAT THE ARMY WILL SAFEGUARD THE FATHERLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY, IT
WILL NOT TURN THE CANNONS AGAINST THE WORKERS.

   I NEVER SAID THAT THE FSLN WOULD PERPETUALLY REMAIN IN THE
GOVERNMENT, BUT THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD PERPETUATE THEMSELVES IN POWER.
THAT I DID SAY!

   OTHERS WILL SAY THAT THE SANDINISTS MADE MANY CONCESSIONS, BUT IF
WE HELD ELECTIONS, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE CONVINCED THAT WE COULD
LOSE, A NEW MODEL IN LATIN AMERICA THAT NOT ONLY GUARANTEES THE
EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT ITS DEVELOPMENT AND DEEPENING.  IT IS
DEMOCRATIC TO CONSTANTLY QUESTION DEMOCRACY TO REFRESH, STRENGTHEN,
AND DEEPEN DEMOCRACY.

   THE CLEANEST AND MOST OBSERVED ELECTORAL PROCESS IS THE ONE THAT
WAS CARRIED OUT IN NICARAGUA.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.  THE REPORTERS
SAID THAT IF WE WON THEY WOULD LEAVE, BUT SINCE WE LOST THEY HAVE
STAYED ON TO SEE IF WE WILL SURRENDER POWER ON 25 APRIL.

   ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE FSLN SUFFERED AN UPSET IN THE
ELECTIONS, AS A POLITICAL FORCE THAT HAS BEEN THE VANGUARD OF THE
PROCESS THAT LED THE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRACY, INDEPENDENCE, DIGNITY, AND
SOVEREIGNTY, THE FSLN IS NOW CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF DEMOCRACY.
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN DEFEATED, BECAUSE IT HAS
EMERGED FROM THE ELECTIONS STRONGER.

   I AM PREPARING TO ACT AS THE OPPOSITION ALONGSIDE THE PEOPLE WHEN I
AM NO LONGER PRESIDENT ON 25 APRIL.  I AM A DEPUTY, BUT I PREFER TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE FACTORIES, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  I HAVE TOLD
THE NICARAGUANS THAT WE MUST CONSOLIDATE THIS PROCESS, WHICH MEANS THE
CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA.  WE MUST BE MORE CREATIVE AND
IMAGINATIVE THAN EVER, BECAUSE WE WILL FACE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WILL
BE ENRICHING TO US AS A REVOLUTION.

   TO BE A CLANDESTINE OPPOSITION IS NOT THE SAME AS TO RULE FROM
ABOVE.  WE WILL NOW GOVERN FROM BELOW, AND WE WILL DEFEND POPULAR AND
NATIONAL INTERESTS.  THE RETURN OF SOMOZISM IS NOT SOUGHT.  THE
ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT MEAN A RETURN OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION,
THAT CONTINUES TO THREATEN NICARAGUA.  IF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS NOT
DISARMED, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONFRONT THE
COUNTERREVOLUTION, AND WE WILL FIGHT AS WE NEVER DID BEFORE.

   THE UNITED STATES LIFTED THE EMBARGO AND OFFERED AID TO NICARAGUA.
WE WILL NOT BE LIKE RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO SABOTAGE ECONOMIC
EFFORTS.  RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED TO A CERTAIN PARTY, BUT TO
ALL OF THE PEOPLE.  NICARAGUA NOT ONLY DESERVES INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION, IT SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

   WE HAVE FELT THE SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER, WE HAVE FELT
THE SOLIDARITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED BY
THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IN OUR FATHERLAND.  I HAVE HEARD OF EMOTIONAL
EXAMPLES OF SOLIDARITY, SUCH AS BRYAN WILSON'S, WHO SAT IN FRONT OF A
TRAIN THAT RAN OVER HIM, AND WHO TELLS ME HE FEELS PROUD TO BE ONE OF
THE THOUSANDS OF AMPUTEES FROM THE WAR IN NICARAGUA.

   THE BLOOD OF CHILEANS, AMERICANS, AND EUROPEANS WAS SHED IN
NICARAGUA.  I MUST THANK THIS HEROIC AND EXEMPLARY CHILE FOR THE
MANNER IN WHICH IT HAS DISPLAYED ITS FONDNESS FOR THE NICARAGUAN
PEOPLE THROUGH ME, AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE
SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM, SOVEREIGNTY,
DEMOCRACY, AND INDEPENDENCE IS INDISPENSABLE.

   THE FUTURE, IT IS SAID, BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE PRESENT
AND THE PAST ALSO BELONG TO THEM.  THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE REFRESHED,
IT SHOULD BE WATERED WITH FRESH RAIN; ONLY THEN WILL THE TREES TURN
GREEN AND THE FLOWERS BLOOM, ONLY THEN WILL THE REVOLUTIONARY
PROCESSES BE UNDERSTOOD.  WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS AND HOURS, BUT THIS
IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK.  IT IS THE TIME TO ACT.

   THIS VISIT TO CHILE WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE
HAPPINESS, OPTIMISM, AND CONFIDENCE REFLECTED IN THE FACES AND IN THE
EYES OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE.

   THIS NIGHT WILL BE UNFORGETTABLE FOR ME.  THEREFORE, I WISH TO PAY
HOMAGE TO THOSE WHO WERE EXAMPLES OF LATIN AMERICAN DIGNITY AND ARE
WITH US ALWAYS IN CHILE, NICARAGUA, AND LATIN AMERICA: SALVADOR
ALLENDE AND PABLO NERUDA.  LONG LIVE NICARAGUA!

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES CHARGED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS ATTACKED A CONTINGENT
OF SOLDIERS IN THE TOWN OF VICTORIA, NORTHEASTERN CABANAS DEPARTMENT,
FROM A SETTLEMENT FOR DISPLACED PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) HAS STATED THAT THE
REBELS FIRED M-60 MACHINEGUNS AT A PATROL OF SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE
SANTA MARTA SETTLEMENT, WHERE SOME 3,000 DISPLACED PERSONS LIVE.

   THE MILITARY REPORT SAID THAT THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ON 15 MARCH
AND THE SOLDIERS DID NOT ANSWER THE FIRE.

   HOWEVER, THE CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE FOR DISPLACED SALVADORANS
(CRIPDES) DENIED THAT THERE ARE ANY ARMED PERSONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT,
WHERE THE PERSONS WHO RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM THE HONDURAN CAMP OF
MESA GRANDE ARE LIVING.

   TOMASA RUIZ, SPOKESPERSON FOR CRIPDES, SAID THAT THE CHARGES "ARE A
DIRECT THREAT" TO THE SECURITY OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS IN SANTA
MARTA.  "THIS DOES NOT MEAN," SHE ADDED, "THAT THERE ARE NO
CONFRONTATIONS TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE THE CAMP, BUT THERE ARE NO ARMED
PERSONS INSIDE THE CAMP."

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HIDING AMONG THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE SOLDIERS.

   ON 11 FEBRUARY, ONE ADULT AND FOUR MINORS WERE KILLED AND 16 OTHERS
WERE WOUNDED WHEN A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER STRAFED A CAMP OF
DISPLACED PERSONS IN CORRAL DE PIEDRAS, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.  ON
THAT OCCASION THE ARMY SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE
GOVERNMENT TROOPS FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES WHO RETURNED TO THE
COUNTRY LATE LAST YEAR, AFTER HAVING LIVED NEARLY ONE DECADE IN THE
HONDURAN CAMPS.

   IN ADDITION, THE ARMED FORCES SAID THAT THREE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN
WOUNDED DURING FIGHTING WITH THE GUERRILLAS IN THE TOWN OF SAN JOSE
GUAYABAL, IN THE CENTRAL CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT.

   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE PUBLIC ON 16 MARCH WHEN THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ANNOUNCED A SUSPENSION OF SABOTAGE
ACTIONS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS, AND THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN OFFICIALS.

   THE ARMY ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE REBELS BLEW UP FIVE ELECTRICITY
POSTS IN SAN VICENTE AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENT IN THE CENTER AND
NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE REBELS ALSO HARASSED SOLDIERS
WHO WERE GUARDING AN ELECTRICITY STATION IN A TOWN OF SANTA ANA
DEPARTMENT AND A MILITARY CHECKPOINT ON THE BRIDGE OVER THE ACELHUATE
RIVER IN AGUILARES, NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY REPORT, THESE HARASSMENT ACTIONS BY THE
REBELS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES.

   SANTIAGO, 13 MAR 90 (BARRICADA) -- [REPORT] [MONICA ZALAQUETT] [TEXT]
U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA DURING AN
OFFICIAL LUNCH AND TOLD HIM THAT HE FULLY AGREES WITH THE NEED TO DEMOBILIZE
AND DISARM THE CONTRAS BEFORE 25 APRIL TO GUARANTEE A NORMAL TRANSITION OF
POWER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

   DANIEL SAID IN A STATEMENT TO BARRICADA: "VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE
TOLD ME THEY ARE WORKING ON AN IDEA SO THAT THE CONTRAS ARE NOT AROUND
BY 25 APRIL.  HE STATED HIS POLITICAL WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS, AND I
BELIEVE HIS POSITION WAS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE."

   WHEN ASKED WHAT STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO CARRY THIS OUT, HE REPLIED:
"WE -- AND NOT ONLY THE NICARAGUANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, BUT ALSO
THE UNITED STATES -- MUST NOW PUT WORDS INTO DEEDS TO PUT THE
POLITICAL WILL INTO ACTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO DISARM AND
DEMOBILIZE THE CONTRAS BEFORE THAT DATE."

   REFERRING TO CERTAIN ATTEMPTS BY UNO SECTORS TO ESTABLISH A
SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARMED FORCES OF NICARAGUA AND THE
CONTRAS' TERRORIST FORCES, DANIEL POINTED OUT: "NO, NO, NO, NOBODY HAS
PROPOSED THIS.  NONE OF THE PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED THINKS
ALONG THESE LINES."

   ORTEGA INSISTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT
HAD BEEN "FRANK, FRIENDLY, DIRECT, AND VERY RESPECTFUL," AND THAT
QUAYLE "IS CERTAIN THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON
25 APRIL.  HE ALSO STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE SO THAT
NICARAGUA DOES NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN A FAR MORE CRITICAL SITUATION THAN
THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY FACING IN EVERY SECTOR."

   DANIEL CONSIDERED THE MEETING, WHICH OCCURRED DURING LUNCH, AS
"VERY POSITIVE, AND I FIND HIM CONSTRUCTIVELY INCLINED TOWARD ALL THE
EFFORTS THAT WE, THE NICARAGUANS, HAVE EXERTED, AND WHICH CULMINATED
WITH THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS."

   THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRED TO CONVERSATIONS HELD DURING THE FLIGHT
BETWEEN CARACAS AND SANTIAGO DE CHILE WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF SPAIN,
VENEZUELA, COSTA RICA, AND HONDURAS, CONFIRMING: "WE ALL AGREE THAT
THE CONTRAS SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DISARMED AND DEMOBILIZED."

   ORTEGA TALKED BRIEFLY WITH QUAYLE YESTERDAY MORNING DURING THE TE
DEUM OFFERED AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL FOR THE PRESIDENTS WHO WERE
INVITED TO THE INAUGURATION OF CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.
WHEN DANIEL ENTERED THE CATHEDRAL, THOSE ATTENDING THE TE DEUM
APPLAUDED HIM WHILE HE GREETED THE HEADS OF STATE WHO WERE THERE.
WHEN QUAYLE ENTERED, HE APPROACHED DANIEL AND GREETED HIM IN A
FRIENDLY MANNER, WHILE THE THRILLED CROWD CONTINUED TO APPLAUD.

   PERSONS WHO OVERHEARD THE BRIEF CONVERSATION REPORTED TO BARRICADA
THAT QUAYLE TOLD DANIEL THAT IF HE WISHED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO BUSH HE
WOULD DELIVER IT, THEREBY AGREEING TO WAIT UNTIL AN APPROPRIATE TIME
TO HOLD THEIR CONVERSATION.  THIS MOMENT OCCURRED SEVERAL HOURS LATER
DURING THE OFFICIAL LUNCH.

   DURING THE MORNING DANIEL ALSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL
PARTIES OPPOSED TO THE OUTGOING PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.  HE EXPLAINED TO
THEM THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS "A
TACTICAL DEFEAT BUT A STRATEGIC VICTORY FOR THE FSLN."

   SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE PRESIDENT MET WITH CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY
LEADERS, INCLUDING PARTY PRESIDENT ANDRES ZALDIVAR.  AT THIS MEETING
THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SAID THAT THE NICARAGUAN ELECTORAL PROCESS WAS
CLEAN AND OPEN, AND THEY PRAISED THE FSLN'S FULFILLMENT OF ITS
DEMOCRATIC OBLIGATIONS.  THEY ALSO PRAISED PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S ATTITUDE
AND THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION HE HAS OBTAINED.

   IN THE AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT ORTEGA SPOKE BRIEFLY TO NEWSMEN AFTER
VISITING "LA MONEDA" PRESIDENTIAL PALACE TO OFFER HIS OFFICIAL
GREETINGS TO CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.  "I HAVE TRANSMITTED
THE GREETINGS OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE TO THE CHILEAN PEOPLE AND HAVE
MADE REFERENCE TO THE LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP THAT UNITES THE TWO
NATIONS," DANIEL TOLD NEWSMEN ON THE PATIO OF THE "LA MONEDA" PALACE,
THE SAME PLACE WHERE PRESIDENT SALVADOR ALLENDE FELL FIGHTING FOR HIS
PEOPLE ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973.

   "IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE, SHARING THIS HISTORICAL MOMENT
WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. I AM CONVINCED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING
TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE CONTINENT TO BUILD AN INDEPENDENT,
FREE, LATIN AMERICAN FATHERLAND WITH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND
WITH TRUE PEACE, SOVEREIGNTY, AND DEMOCRACY," ORTEGA TOLD THE
JOURNALISTS, WHO RESPONDED WITH APPLAUSE.

   INTERIOR MINISTER ENRIQUE KRAUSS, LEGISLATORS, CHURCH OFFICIALS AND
OTHER AUTHORITIES VISITED THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK ON LEIGH'S CONDITION.

   PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN SUSPENDED ALL AUDIENCES AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF THE SAVAGE ATTACK. MINISTER SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT ENRIQUE CORREA
SAID THE ATTACK WAS TREMENDOUSLY REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE.

   INTERIOR UNDER SECRETARY VELISARIO VELAZCO SAID THE GROUP

FOR THE TIME BEING OUT OF IMMEDIATE DANGER OF DEATH. THE OTHER GENERAL
WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK, RETIRED GENERAL ENRIQUE RUIZ, WAS HIT BY THREE
BULLETS AND IS BEING TREATED AT THE AIR FORCE HOSPITAL.

   SO FAR THE MILITARY HOSPITAL HAS NOT RELEASED ANY OFFICIAL REPORT
ON LEIGH'S CONDITION. THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT, AUTONOMOUS
FACTION, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE RULING GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY WAS

TODAY.  SOLORZANO, WHO WAS 45 AND THE MUNICIPAL MAYOR OF SAN PABLO
(SAN MARCOS DEPARTMENT), WAS FOUND SHOT IN THE CABUZ RIVER IN
MALACATAN MUNICIPALITY, THE SOURCES SAID.

   NO ONE KNOWS THE MOTIVE FOR THE POLITICAL LEADER'S MURDER IN SAN
MARCOS, A DEPARTMENT WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN RECENT
DAYS.

   EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 21 MARCH, REBEL GROUPS DETONATED EIGHT

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LEMOS BY
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] JARAMILLO OSSA
HAS SAID THAT FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT FOR
PROTECTION, THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER, AND THAT HE HELD THE
GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM.  THAT IS
WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID.

   [LEMOS] DID YOU SAY FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS?

   [REPORTER] THAT IS WHAT JARAMILLO OSSA SAID, THAT THE GOVERNMENT
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SAFETY DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS.  HE ALSO SAID
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED FROM THEN ON WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED ON YOUR
STATEMENT, AND THAT THE BEST SERVICE YOU COULD GIVE THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE TO RESIGN.

   [LEMOS] I ALREADY REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT MY RESIGNATION.  I
CANNOT RESIGN BECAUSE I AM NOT GUILTY.  BY RESIGNING I WOULD BE
ADMITTING MY GUILT TO SOMETHING I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.  HOWEVER, I
AM GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 4
YEARS.  I WAS A JOURNALIST FOUR YEARS AGO.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] MADE A MISTAKE A FEW DAYS AGO BY
AGAIN LINKING THE UP WITH THE FARC?

   [LEMOS] I PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS THIS TOPIC NOW.  I DO NOT THINK
THAT THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO DISCUSS THAT SUBJECT.

   AFTER THIS SITUATION HAS SETTLED, I WILL HAVE TO FILE A FORMAL
STATEMENT AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHERE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED
BY THE UP.  AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I AM OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, BUT NOW IS NOT
THE MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [LEMOS] OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY DISTRESSED, AS WE ALL ARE.
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A TERRIBLE; THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING A GOAL
OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THE
GOVERNMENT WANTS A FREE ELECTORAL PROCESS; IT IS COMMITTED TO THAT.

   TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ORDERLY ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT
WOULD BE ABSURD, ILLOGICAL, IRRATIONAL, AND SENSELESS FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT RUN COUNTER TO ITS GOAL OF ENSURING
THAT ITS TERM ENDS IN PEACE AND THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE
NORMALLY.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS AGAIN CAST DOUBT OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S
GUARANTEES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE PARTY.

   [LEMOS] I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY
POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF
UP MEMBERS, BUT OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
AFFILIATION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT
DR JARAMILLO'S BODYGUARDS REACTED AND, I UNDERSTAND, BY KILLING ONE OF
THE ASSASSINS, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD, AND ARRESTED
ANOTHER ONE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
INDEED OFFERING PROTECTION.

   THEREFORE, DR. JARAMILLO WAS INDEED ENJOYING GOVERNMENT PROTECTION
JUST AS THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT
THE ASSASSINS CARRY OUT SURPRISE ATTACKS.  AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AN
APPROACHING PERSON CAN CAN PULL OUT A WEAPON AND KILL WHOMEVER HE
WANTS.  THERE IS NO 100-PERCENT PREVENTION AGAINST THIS.  THIS HOLDS
TRUE NOT ONLY IN COLOMBIA BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  THE
VERY COURSE OF THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING AT THE AIPORT
SHOW THAT DR JARAMILLO WAS INDEED PROTECTED.

   [REPORTER] THE UP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL FILE SUIT AGAINST
YOU FOR THIS ASSASSINATION.

   [LEMOS] THAT IS FINE.  IF THE UP HAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT I AM
INVOLVED IN DR. JARAMILLO'S ASSASSINATION, THEN IT MUST FILE SUIT,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS
ASSASSINATION.  I BELIEVE THAT SUITS MUST BE FILED BY THOSE WHO
SUSPECT THAT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AND MYSELF PARTICULARLY, MAY BE
INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION, TO ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT IS
INVESTIGATED.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD NEWS AMID A SEA
OF BAD NEWS THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONLY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PHYSICAL
SAFETY, BUT THERE IS ALSO POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY.  YOU ARE BEING
ACCUSED OF POLITICAL IRRESPONSIBILITY AND OF NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR
PHYSICAL SAFETY.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 22 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] OTTO SORTO MILLA, THE
SON-IN-LAW OF GENERAL RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, CHIEF OF THE SALVADORAN AIR
FORCE, WAS WOUNDED IN AN ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY AND IS IN
"SERIOUS CONDITION," ACCORDING TO MILITARY SPOKESMEN AND DOCTORS.

   THE SOURCES POINTED OUT THAT SORTO MILLA, 25, WAS MACHINEGUNNED
FROM A MOVING VEHICLE WHILE LEAVING HIS HOME, LOCATED IN THE LUXURIOUS
SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.

   DOCTORS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT GEN. VILLAMARIONA'S SON-IN-LAW IS "IN
SERIOUS CONDITION" AT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AT
1030 (1630 GMT), BUT THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHERE THE BULLET WOUNDS WERE
OR THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT HIT HIM.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT SORTO MILLA HAD BULLET WOUNDS IN
SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS
LONG AS THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO CAPTURE THE
ASSAILANTS.

   GEN. VILLAMARIONA, CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE HARD-LINE MILITARY
CHIEFS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WAS APPOINTED TO HIS PRESENT POST IN
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR REPLACING GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, WHO WAS
APPOINTED MILITARY ATTACHE IN ISRAEL.

   THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE (FAS) PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE LAST
GUERRILLA MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER 1989, AND IT WAS ACCUSED BY
OPPOSITION GROUPS, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
OF INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL TO
DISLODGE REPORTED GUERRILLA REDOUBTS.

   THE ATTACK ON SORTO MILLA TOOK PLACE A WEEK AFTER THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS ATTACKS ON
CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF
CONDITIONS FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   BOGOTA, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH LLOREDA
BY REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] AMID ALL THE CONFUSION AND
ALARM THAT TODAY PREVAILS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHAT WOULD DR.
LLOREDA DO TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRANQUILITY?  WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE AND
MOST URGENT THING TO DO?

   [LLOREDA] JUAN, I BELIEVE THAT SECURITY IS NO LONGER AN ACADEMIC
ISSUE; IT HAS BECOME AN ANGUISHED NEED FOR COLOMBIA.  THIS WILL
PROBABLY MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE MANY SACRIFICES IF WE WANT TO
PUT A STOP TO VIOLENCE WITHIN A FEW YEARS.  IN FACT, WE WILL HAVE TO
SACRIFICE SOME OF THE BROAD AND GENEROUS FREEDOM WE HAVE ALWAYS
ENJOYED IN THIS COUNTRY.  GIVEN THESE DEPLORABLE ACTIONS, THE SECURITY
ISSUE HAS BECOME A PRIORITY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT LIVE IN A SOCIETY IN
WHICH ITS MEMBERS ARE CONTINUOUSLY THREATENED.  THIS NOT ONLY REFERS
TO DR. JARAMILLO OSSA'S DEATH, BUT ALSO TO OTHER DEATHS THAT SOMETIMES
DO NOT APPEAR WHERE THEY SHOULD, MEANING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
NEWSPAPERS.

   A WEEK OR TWO AGO THE POLICE SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD AN AVERAGE OF 54
VIOLENT DEATHS PER DAY SO FAR THIS YEAR.  IF THIS CONTINUES, WE WILL
HAVE MORE THAN 12,000 MURDERS IN COLOMBIA BY THE TIME PRESIDENT BARCO
TURNS OVER POWER ON 7 AUGUST.  I BELIEVE, AND I THINK YOU SHARE THE
SAME VIEWPOINT, THAT WE HAVE A WORLD RECORD FOR INSECURITY AND
VIOLENCE.  THEREFORE, WE CANNOT TAKE THE RISK OF ALLOWING THE PROCESS
OF MORAL COLLAPSE AND THE STATE OF INSECURITY THAT PREVAILS IN THE
COUNTRY TO CONTINUE.

   WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE STATE SO THAT IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY COUNTER
VIOLENCE.  THE PLEBISCITE AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY I HAVE BEEN
PROPOSING INCLUDES THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO HAVE EFFICIENT
INSTRUMENTS TO COUNTER VIOLENT ACTIONS.  THIS IS NOT, LIKE I SAID IN
THE BEGINNING, AN ACADEMIC ISSUE; AND IT IS NOT A PROPOSAL PRESENTED
BY IDEALISTIC YOUTHS.  IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF A NATION THAT COULD
DISAPPEAR OR LOSE ITS FREEDOMS AND DEMOCRACY, IF WE DO NOT ACT
DECISIVELY AND RESOLUTELY.  THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM BETWEEN POLITICAL
PARTIES.

   YESTERDAY I PRESENTED MY GOVERNMENT PLATFORM AND I ISSUED A
PROPOSAL TO DR. [CESAR] GAVIRIA -- REGARDLESS OF THE 27 MAY ELECTORAL
RESULTS, WE MUST REACH A PATRIOTIC AGREEMENT.  WE CAN NOW DO IT IN
HOMAGE TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO SO THAT THE IDEA OF A PLEBISCITE IS
SPONSORED.  THUS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A THOROUGH INSTITUTIONAL
REORGANIZATION.  WE MUST SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT COLOMBIA, RATHER
THAN ELECTORAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
OFFER SOLUTIONS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE
ARE NOW LOOKING TO THEIR FUTURE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, DR. LLOREDA, YOU ARE VERY KIND.

MINISTER JULIO LINARES ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD GRANTED
SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE FORMER OFFICIALS OF THE DEPOSED REGIME, HEADED BY
GENERAL MANUAL ANTONIO NORIEGA.  THE FIVE FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE
PRESENTLY AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY.

   ACCORDING TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT, FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE
BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER MORTGAGE BANK
MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER TOURISM INSTITUTE DIRECTOR BERNARDO
DOMINGUEZ, AND FORMER HYRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION INSTITUTE
DIRECTOR OVIGILDO HERRERA, ARE THE FORMER OFFICIALS WHO WILL BE ABLE
TO TRAVEL TO ECUADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   LINARES ADDED THAT THE DECISION TO GRANT A SAFE-CONDUCT TO FORMER
DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PARTY LEGISLATOR LUIS "LUCHO" GOMEZ --
PRESENTLY AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY -- HAS BEEN REVOKED BECAUSE HE FACES
CHARGES OF "KIDNAPPING AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AGAINST
THE PANAMANIAN CITIZEN HERNAN ARIAS."

   THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF
BREAKING RELATIONS WITH MEXICO OR PERU.  ACCORDING TO HIS EXPLANATION,
THE SITUATION WITH CUBA IS DIFFERENT.  TODAY, PANAMA GAVE CUBAN
AMBASSADOR LAZARO MORA FIVE DAYS TO QUIT THE COUNTRY "BECAUSE OF THE
UNJUSTIFIED ATTACKS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT."

   FORMER PANAMA NATIONAL BANK MANAGER RAFAEL AROSEMENA HAS TAKEN
REFUGE AT THE MEXICAN EMBASSY.  AROSEMENA IS CHARGED WITH ALLOWING A
FORMER COMMAND STAFF MEMBER OF THE ELIMINATED PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES
[FDP] TO CASH CHECKS MADE OUT TO THE BEARER FOR $12 MILLION.  THE
FORMER FDP MAYORS HERACLIDIS SUCRE MEDINA AND GONZALO GONZALEZ

   BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA ARANGO DECREED A DRY LAW AT NOON, AND
SUSPENDED CLASSES IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS
TOMORROW, 23 MARCH.

   THE PRESIDENT ATTENDED A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING AT NATINO PALACE

PREMISES.  DEFENSE MINISTER OSCAR BOTERO SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT THE ASSASSINATION UPON INSTRUCTIONS FROM PABLO
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, WHO MADE A DOWN PAYMENT OF 300,000 PESOS TO ANDRES
ARTURO GUTIERREZ, THE ASSASSIN HIRED TO PERPETRATE THE CRIME.

   THE ASSASSIN, A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH, IS RECOVERING FROM HIS WOUNDS

ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION.

   MOREOVER, DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] DETECTIVE
EDISON SANCHEZ MENDIETA, WHO WAS WOUNDED THIS MORNING AT THE AIRPORT
TERMINAL, WAS RELEASED THIS AFTERNOON.

   REFERRING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE WEAPON WAS SMUGGLED INTO THE
AIRPORT, THE AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING THOROUGHLY
INVESTIGATED BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS -- BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
ASSEMBLED INSIDE THE PREMISES OR SMUGGLED IN WITH THE COMPLICITY OF A
MAINTENANCE WORKER.

   RIOTS, CLASHES, AND THE BURNING OF TIRES AND FIVE BUSES WAS
REPORTED IN SEVERAL HIGHER EDUCATION CENTERS OF BOGOTA, SUCH AS THE
FREE UNIVERSITY, THE PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY, THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;
AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS POLICARPA SALAVARRIETA, GARCES NAVAS, AND
SOACHA.  THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE WOUNDING OF A POLICEMAN, WHOSE
CONDITION IS STILL CRITICAL.

FARM WORKERS IN URABA, WHERE THE ASSASSINATED LEADER WORKED AS A LABOR
LAWYER, REACTED SIMILARLY.

BARBARA, WHERE PEASANTS ALLEGEDLY HELPED THEM.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT "IF THE CHARGE MADE BY THE PEASANTS IS PROVEN
TO BE TRUE, THE REASON FOR THE ATTACK COULD BE IN RETALIATION FOR THE
GREAT NUMBER OF PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL MEMBERS KILLED TWO MONTHS AGO."

   THE SO-CALLED "PEASANT DEFENSE PATROLS" WERE CREATED BY THE ARMY
FOUR YEARS AGO TO STRUGGLE AGAINST SHINING PATH TERRORISTS IN DISTANT
PLACES WHICH LACK SECURITY FORCES.

ORGANIZATION AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA) ARE
STAGING ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL
PERUVIAN ELECTIONS.

   A BOMB EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING NEAR THE HOUSE OF HEALTH
MINISTER PAUL CARO GAMARRA.  CARO'S WIFE SAID THAT THE HOUSE, WHICH IS
IN THE PORT OF EL CALLAO, LACKS POLICE PROTECTION.

   THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CENTER-RIGHTIST DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO),
WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, WAS
BOMBED LAST NIGHT.  THE MRTA CLAIMED THE ATTACK THROUGH LEAFLETS LEFT
AT THE SCENE.

   THE MRTA ALSO PLANTED EXPLOSIVES AND LEFT LEAFLETS BESIDE FIVE
FREDEMO PLACARDS.

   FORTY MEMBERS OF FREDEMO WERE AT THE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH IS ON AN
IMPORTANT LIMA AVENUE, WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED.  NOBODY WAS INJURED.
DAVID CIFUENTES, A DEPUTY CANDIDATE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR
REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) TODAY SAID THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST
PLOT TO KILL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

   ON 14 MARCH CIFUENTES ESCAPED UNHARMED FROM AN ATTACK ON THE CAR IN
WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING.  HIS BODYGUARD DIED IN THE ATTACK WHICH
OCCURRED 40 KM FROM THE CITY OF CAJAMARCA.

   THE TERRORISTS PLACED BIG STONES AT A CURVE IN THE ROAD WHICH
CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO RUN OFF THE ROAD.  THE ATTACKERS THEN OPENED
FIRE ON THE CAR.

   CIFUENTES FELL OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND BROKE HIS ARM IN TWO PLACES,
AND IS NOW IN HOSPITAL.

   SHINING PATH MEMBERS RECENTLY MURDERED 19 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 10
CHILDREN, IN A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR HUANCAYO CITY, 415 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.
THIS ACT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE MAOISTS ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE
KILLING AND DESTROYING.

   SOME 300 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BY THE SHINING PATH DURING THE
BOYCOTT OF THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ON 12 NOVEMBER 1989.

   THE ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY THE MRTA LAST NIGHT BELIES THE ALLEGED
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO USE VIOLENCE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS PUBLISHED BY A LOCAL NEWSPAPER TWO DAYS AGO.

   UNITED LEFT DEPUTY GUSTAVO ESPINOSA, IN A STATEMENT TO THE DAILY
ONDA, SAID THAT IF THE MRTA IS TRULY SEEKING A POLITICAL WAY TO TURN
IN THEIR WEAPONS "THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACIFICATION OF THE
COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, ESPINOSA SAID THAT ONE CANNOT CONSIDER AN END TO THE
VIOLENCE UNTIL THERE IS MORE PROOF OF THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT.

   DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE SHINING PATH AND THE MRTA HAVE
PERPETRATED MORE THAN 16,000 ATTACKS WHICH HAVE CAUSED DAMAGE
ESTIMATED AT $10,000.  THIS ESTIMATE WAS PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL
COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF ASSESSING THE EFFECTS AND CAUSES OF POLITICAL
VIOLENCE IN PERU.

   DURING PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S TERM OF OFFICE THE TERRORISTS HAVE
PERPETRATED 10,621 ATTACKS, WHICH REPRESENTS AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN
SIX ATTACKS PER DAY DURING HIS FIVE YEARS IN POWER.

   FATAL VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY 19,000,
OF WHICH 700 HAVE DIED DURING 1990.

   CLANDESTINE, 22 MAR 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] IN PREVIOUS
BROADCASTS WE REPORTED HONDURAN TROOP INCURSIONS INTO SALVADORAN TERRITORY.
WE HAVE RECEIVED NEW REPORTS OF SUCH INCURSIONS.

   HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED 2 KM INSIDE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, IN
ZANCUDO VILLAGE, IN THE AREA OF SABANETAS CANTON, PERQUIN
JURISDICTION, AT 1200 ON 19 MARCH.  THEY TOOK 22-YEAR-OLD GILBERTO
MOLASCO, SON OF PATRICIO RODRIGUEZ, AND 17-YEAR-OLD ANDRES ARGUETA,
SON OF EMIMESIO ARGUETA.  THEY WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEIR
WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN.

   ON 17 MARCH, THE TROOPS ARRIVED IN PALO BLANCO VILLAGE AND THEY
SEARCHED THE HOUSE OF LEONOR VELIZ, THREATING TO CAPTURE HER SON,
CRISTIANO BENITEZ.  THEY BEAT HIM UP, ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A
GUERRILLA, AND THEY STOLE THEIR DOCUMENTS AND MONEY.  THEY ALSO TOLD
THEM NOT TO REPORT THE ACTION TO THE RED CROSS, THREATING TO KILL THEM
IF THEY DID SO.

   THE RESIDENTS OF THESE BORDER VILLAGES ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE TWO YOUTHS CAPTURED BY HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS.

   LIMA, 25 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT THE "PATRIOTIC LIBERATION FRONT" [FRENTE PATRIOTICO DE
LIBERACION] BOMBED THREE IMPORTANT PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN LIMA TODAY,
CAUSING A LOT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE BUT NO CASUALTIES.

   A POLICE SOURCE REPORTED THAT GROUPS FROM THIS NEW TERRORIST
MOVEMENT ATTACKED THE CITY HALL OF SAN JUAN DE MIRAFLORES, ON THE
OUTSKIRTS OF LIMA; AN ELECTROLIMA [LIMA ELECTRIC POWER ENTERPRISE]
OFFICE; AND AN ENTELPERU [NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE OF
PERU] OFFICE IN THE MIRAFLORES AND SURCO DISTRICTS OF LIMA. THE SOURCE
ADDED: "THIS NEW TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WANTS TO INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE
TO PREVENT THEM FROM EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY (8
APRIL)."

   IN THESE ELECTIONS THE PEOPLE WILL ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC, TWO VICE PRESIDENTS, 180 DEPUTIES, AND 60 SENATORS.  IT IS
BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST 10 MILLION PERUVIANS WILL VOTE.

   UP TO NOW THE POLICE HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS AND
CRIMES TO THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" GROUP AND THE MARXIST "TUPAC AMARU
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" (MRTA). THE "SHINING PATH" AND THE "MRTA" ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 700 PEOPLE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING
A DOZEN CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES AND
SOME THIRTY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES.

   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 11 MAR 90 (EL NACIONAL) -- [REPORT] [OJEDA]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL GN REPORTS, VENEZUELA, WHERE
BANKING IS LOSELY CONTROLLED AND NO LAWS AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING
EXIST, A SYSTEM OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INVESTIGATIONS IS TO BE
ESTABLISHED.

   GN COMMANDER GENERAL MANUEL IBEDACA ROMERO AGREED TO TALK ABOUT THE
TOPIC DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH EL NACIONAL.

   [OJEDA] GENERAL, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT VENEZUELA'S ALLEGED
VULNERABILTY TO THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS.  IS THIS TRUE?
IS THERE A DANGER THAT VENEZUELA COULD BECOME AN OPERATIONAL BASE FOR THE
COCAINE MAFIA?  IS IT TRUE THAT HEAVY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED NEAR
THE BORDER AND OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, WITH MONEY OF WHICH NO ONE KNOWS
THE SOURCE?  WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CONTROL THIS FLOW OF CAPITAL?

   [IBEDACA] I SHARE THIS CONCERN.  IT IS VERY SIMPLE: WHEN YOU ARE IN
A BUILDING OR A HOUSE AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE,
THIS OF COURSE DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU BECAUSE OF THE UNREST, BECAUSE
THERE MIGHT BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO TESTIFY.

   IBEDACA THUS BEGINS HIS EXPLANATIONS WITH A SIMPLE,
EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND DOMESTIC ANALOGY.  HE ADMITS THAT VENEZUELA "IS IN
A SITUATION THAT SHOULD REALLY CATCH OUR ATTENTION, BECAUSE VENEZUELA
BORDERS COLOMBIA AND WE KNOW THAT COCA IS PRODUCED MAINLY IN BOLIVIA,
PERU, ECUADOR, AND IS PROCESSED IN COLOMBIA.  COLOMBIA IS AMERICA'S
GREAT COCAINE LABORATORY.  DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE RECENTLY SUFFERED
HARD SETBACKS THROUGH RECENT ACTIONS BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY AND
NATIONAL POLICE IN WHICH THE HEADS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
KILLED AND GREAT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND COCAINE AND A NUMBER OF
AIRPLANES HAVE BEEN SEIZED.  TO TRANSPORT WHAT IS LEFT, THEY WILL, OF
COURSE, HAVE TO LOOK FOR A BETTER PLACE AND THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE
SEVERAL VULNERABILITIES."

   [OJEDA] LIKE WHAT?

   [IBEDACA] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER, THE PLAINS NEAR IT WITH CLANDESTINE
LANDING STRIPS; THE PROXIMITY TO EASY-TO-USE PORTS AND AIRPORTS.
THROUGH THE ANTIDRUG TRAFFICKING SERVICES AND TOGETHER WITH THE DISIP
[DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION SERVICES] AND THE
METROPOLITAN POLICE, WE HAVE A PLAN AND WE HAVE TAKEN DEFINITE ACTIONS
TO FIGHT IT.  AWARE OF THIS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF
INVESTMENT CONTROLS IN THESE STATES NEAR COLOMBIA.  WE ARE RECEIVING
REPORTS OF PROPERTY REGISTRATIONS, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE
MEASURES, BECAUSE WE NEED GREATER CONTROL AND SUPERVISION IN THIS
AREA, ESPECIALLY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS.

   IN 1986, THREE YEARS AFTER THE DRUG LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, THE GN'S
ANTIDRUG DIVISION MADE A RECORD CONFISCATION OF 29,698 KILOS OF
MARIJUANA (NEARLY 30 TONS), A FIGURE THAT DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN
1988, AND INCREASED IN 1989.

   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED BY GENERAL GERMAN SEPULVEDA SIERRA, THIS
OFFICE HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING AND PLANNING ACTIONS THAT
THE GN DEVELOPS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LIMITED BY
THE DRUG LAW AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TRIBUNALS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE
FILES MUST BE TURNED OVER TO THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE [PTJ].

   IT IS CURRENTLY CALLED THE DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICES AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND IS DIRECTED BY BRIGADIER GENERAL RAMON GUILLEN DAVILA,
WHO ALSO AGREED TO TALK TO EL NACIONAL.

   [GUILLEN] THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS HAS BEEN A JOB OF THE GN DURING
ALL OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I HAVE BEEN IN IT SINCE I WAS A SUBLIEUTENANT.
NOW IT IS CALLED THE "MODERN CRIME" AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT WARS
TO FIGHT.

   [OJEDA] PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT WAR, THE BIG COLOMBIAN
TRAFFICKERS HAVE PROPOSED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT FORMULAS TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND RETIRE FROM THE DRUG BUSINESS.  ARE THESE PROPOSALS
FROM THE DRUG CARTELS SINCERE?  WE ASKED THE GENERAL.

   [GUILLEN] I THINK THAT IT IS ONLY A STRATEGY TO GAIN TIME AND SEEK
THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS.  IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT THEY ARE PRETENDING TO
TURN VENEZUELA INTO AN "OPERATIONAL BASE."  THERE IS DEMOCRACY AND
LIBERTY OF MOVEMENT AND INVESTMENT HERE.  IN JUST SAN ANTONIO DEL
TACHIRA, THERE ARE 76 EXCHANGE HOUSES AND ONLY ONE MEETS THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW.  WHEN WE HAVE PRESSURED THE PERACAL TAX
REGISTRY, WE GOT COMPLAINTS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE.  THE VENEZUELAN AIR
AND HIGHWAY SYSTEM IS VERY FAVORABLE TO THEM.  NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
CONNECT WITH EUROPE THROUGH VENEZUELA.  A LOT OF MERCHANDISE GOES
THROUGH IN TRANSIT, AND WHEN THEY SEIZE A SHIPMENT, WHAT THEY SAY IS
THAT THE AIRPLANE "CAME FROM VENEZUELA."  [CONTINUED]

   LIMA, 27 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE ATTACKS ON FIVE OFFICES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), WHICH IS HEADED BY MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, ON
THE OFFICE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE,
APRA, AND AGAINST ONE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, TWO BANKS, ONE STORE, AND
ONE MOVIE THEATER, SHOW THAT TERRORISM IN PERU CONTINUES TO BE USED IN
AN ATTEMPT TO BOYCOTT THE 8 APRIL ELECTIONS.

   ONE GIRL WAS WOUNDED DURING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCURRED IN LIMA
YESTERDAY, AND FOUR INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED WHILE LOOTING TWO SHOE
STORES AND A MARKET AND URGING PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM.

   THE ATTACKS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE OFFICES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES,
ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE FREDEMO, BUT NO ONE WAS INJURED.

   THE PAGINA LIBRE NEWSPAPER TODAY REPORTED THAT SEVEN ALLEGED
MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) WERE ARRESTED
IN THE CITY OF TRUJILLO, 570 KM NORTH OF LIMA.  THE MIR IS A FACTION
OF THE PRO-GUEVARA TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA).

   THE MAOIST SHINING PATH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS CALLED FOR "AN
ARMED STRIKE" -- A STRIKE UNDER THREAT OF DEATH -- IN LIMA TOMORROW.
THIS IS THE THIRD ARMED STRIKE TO BE CALLED BY THIS ORGANIZATION SO
FAR THIS MONTH.

   A 48-HOUR ARMED STRIKE WAS CALLED IN AYACUCHO, THE BIRTHPLACE OF
THE SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION AND THE OTHER ONE IN HUANTA.

   PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA YESTERDAY DELIVERED 170 PATROL CARS TO THE
NATIONAL POLICE.  HE URGED THE POLICE TO RESOLUTELY FACE THE
INCREASING WAVE OF TERRORISM AND TO MAKE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE
RESOURCES.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE YESTERDAY COMMISSIONED A SQUAD OF 16
MOTORCYCLES TO PATROL THE CITY AND TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE SITES OF
ATTACKS.

   IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUBVERSIVES WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS
IN A WAVE OF TERROR BEFORE THE ELECTIONS AND THIS IS WHY THE POLICE
AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT.

   ABOUT 100,000 POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALERT THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE MURDER LAST WEEK OF FOUR CANDIDATES FOR
DEPUTIES, AN APRA LEADER, AND THE MANAGERS OF SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN
LIMA, AND OTHER CITIES.

   LIMA AND CALLAO HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH
MEANS THAT INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.

   YESTERDAY AYACUCHO WAS LEFT IN DARKNESS AFTER A SHINING PATH
ATTACK.  AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED, SEVERAL WERE WOUNDED, AND
VARIOUS ARRESTS WERE MADE BY THE POLICE.

   YESTERDAY WAS THE MOST VIOLENT DAY IN AYACUCHO SINCE LAST NOVEMBER
WHEN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WERE HELD.  THE ELECTIONS WERE THEN ANNULLED
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF NULL AND BLANK VOTES.

   LAST WEEK IN HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, AN APRA CANDIDATE
FOR DEPUTY WAS MURDERED.  YESTERDAY AN INDIVIDUAL WAS WOUNDED WHEN A
CAR BOMB EXPLODED CAUSING EXTENSIVE MATERIAL DAMAGE.

   YESTERDAY IN CHICLAYO, IN NORTHERN PERU, A BOMB WAS THROWN AT THE
HOUSE OF FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY MIGUEL ANGEL BARTRA, WHO WAS NOT
IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME.

   IN LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT A TERRORIST GROUP TOOK OVER THE
GUADALUPITO TOWN EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING IN AN EFFORT TO FIND THE
LOCAL APRA SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE TOWN'S MAYOR.

   WHEN THE TERRORISTS COULD NOT FIND THEM, THEY BLEW UP THE OFFICES
OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND THE POWER STATION CAUSING AN OUTAGE IN THE
ZONE.

   THE STRIKES AFFECTING 100,000 WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY CONTINUE AND
THE STRIKERS HAVE REJECTED THE "LABOR TRUCE" UNTIL THE ELECTIONS ARE
OVER THAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA.

   MANTILLA SAID THAT THE STRIKES "ARE BORDERING ON THE SEDITIOUS AND
THE CRIMINAL."

   IN THE LAST 10 YEARS POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN PERU HAS CAUSED 19,000
DEATHS, OF WHICH 700 HAVE OCCURRED SO FAR THIS YEAR.

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE REFORMIST SECTOR OF THE LEFTIST
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) TODAY RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COORDINATING
BOARD, CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IN ITS FIVE YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF ITS PLENUM, TWELVE OF ITS 20 MEMBERS,
INCLUDING UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, RESIGNED FROM THE
NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ACTIVISTS OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (PCC).

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE UP, THE REFORMIST FACTION
RESIGNED FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT WHAT IS
NEEDED IN COLOMBIA IS A BROAD SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT
ADVOCATED BY UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, WHO
WAS ASSASSINATED ON 22 MARCH.

   THE LEFTIST SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE INDICATED TODAY THAT THE
POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AT
LEAST WITH A JOINT UP AND PCC CANDIDATE, IS GROWING MORE DISTANT.

   WHILE THE UP'S REFORMIST FACTION REJECTS THE ARMED PATH AS A MEANS
TO ACHIEVE POWER, THE SECTOR KNOWN AS THE RADICALS, IN OTHER WORDS,
THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD,
AGREE ON USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRUGGLE, INCLUDING GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE.

   THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN BELONG TO THE PCC.

   IN ADDITION TO MONTANA, LEADERS ANGELINO GARZON, GUILLERMO
BANGUERO, ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, JULIO SANTANA, AND LUIS EMIRO VALENCIA
WERE AMONG THOSE WHO RESIGNED.

   AT THE SAME TIME, 12 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ANOTHER
SECTION OF THE PARTY, ALSO RESIGNED.  THEY ARE ALSO FROM THE REFORMIST
FACTION.

   THE FRICTION WITH THE REFORMISTS OR PERESTROYKA SUPPORTERS BEGAN ON
28 MARCH, THE FIRST DAY OF SESSIONS OF THE PLENUM, WHEN ANGELINO
GARZON CHARGED THAT THE PCC HAD INTERCEPTED JARAMILLO OSSA'S LETTERS.

   ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEFT WAS THE
NOT VERY FAVORABLE RESULTS IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS, WHEN THE UP AND THE PCC LOST SEVERAL SEATS IN THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   UP TO 22 MARCH, THE DAY WHEN JARAMILLO WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS THE
SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UP AND THE PCC, BUT AFTER HIS
DEATH, BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO HOLD A PLENUM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 MAR 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [LEONID LEVCHENKO] [TEXT]
OBVIOUS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN SOLVING THE REGIONAL CONFLICT IN
CENTRAL AMERICA.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WILL
MEDIATE A MEETING IN CARACAS BETWEEN SALVADORAN REBELS AND A
GOVERNMENT DELEGATION.  CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALAN
GUERRILLAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION WILL ALSO BE HELD IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL, OSLO.

   LISTEN WHAT OUR COMMENTATOR LEONID LEVCHEKO HAS TO SAY:

   THESE TWO MEETINGS HAVE ONE POINT IN COMMON: BOTH HAVE BEEN MADE
POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE INITIATIVE AND THE MEDIATION OF THE MOST
DIVERSE CIRCLES, WHICH ARE INTERESTED IN PUTTING OUT THE FIRE IN
CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE CARACAS MEETING COINCIDES WITH THE START TODAY
OF THE OFFICIAL VISIT BY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, WHO WELCOMED
CRISTIANI, HAS ALREADY HELD TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS
DELEGATION.

   THE VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE WILL ACT AS MEDIATOR IN THE DIALOGUE
BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS WHEN THEY SIT AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE.  THE OSLO MEETING WAS CONCEIVED AT THE INITIATIVE
OF THE LUTHERAN AND CATHOLIC CHURCHES.  THIS IS A BIG ADVANCE IF ONE
CONSIDERS THAT THE FIRST AND LAST DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE
GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 1987 IN
SPAIN.  THEY WERE THEN SUSPENDED AND NEVER RESUMED.

   [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ADVANCE TOWARD
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN CONFLICT.  BEFORE THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN 1967
BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, MANY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, WHICH
HINDERED A SOLUTION, WERE INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.

   THE MILITARY CHIEFS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA ALSO REJECTED THE
NEGOTIATION PROCESS, ASSUMING THAT THEY COULD DEFEAT THE REBEL
MOVEMENT.  IN FACT, DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR MORE THAN 70,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN EL SALVADOR AND IN NEARLY 30 YEARS OF
CONFLICT IN GUATEMALA MORE THAN 100,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED.

   IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRATRICIDAL WAR IS ABSURD BOTH IN EL
SALVADOR AND IN GUATEMALA.  IT IS TIME THAT, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF
NICARAGUA, OTHER COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE AREA.
THIS IS WHY THE REPORTS COMING FROM CARACAS AND OSLO HAVE BEEN GREETED
WITH GREAT INTEREST.  IT IS CLEAR THAT A JUST SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE IN
CENTRAL AMERICA IF ONLY THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE
STRICTLY FOLLOWED AND THE COUNTRIES' SOVEREIGNTY IS RESPECTED BY NOT
MEDDLING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES.

   THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOVIET VIEW ON CENTRAL AMERICA.

0230 GMT BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE OR RECORDED A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS FROM THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA.  RECEPTION IS FAIR TO POOR.

   BARCO BEGINS HIS ADDRESS BY EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN OVER THE
DISNFORMATION CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE RECENT EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN
PLACE.  HE GOES ON TO CITE THE VARIOUS ITEMS BEING PUBLISHED BY THE
COUNTRY'S MEDIA CONCERNING SECRET DEALINGS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS, A
RELAXATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND OTHER STORIES
WHICH HE INSISTS ARE NOT TRUE.

   HE BLAMES NARCOTERRORISM FOR THE VIOLENCE AND CONFUSION WARNS THAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT.  BARCO NOTES THAT
THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTS THE MEDIA AND SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC OPINION IS
BEING MANIPULATED.  HE THEN TOUCHES ON THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE
KIDNAPPING OF THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY.
BARCO SAYS: "THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPING OF DR.
MONTOYA'S SON, AS ON OTHER UNFORTUNATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING THE CASES
OF DR. ANDRES PASTRANA AND DR. ALVARO GOMEZ, AND EVEN CASES IN WHICH
MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN KDNAPPED BY SUBVERSIVES, HAS
CONSIDERED AS APPROPRIATE AND VALUABLE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE WHO
PERFORMED HUMANITARIAN DUTIES AND SHOWED GOOD WILL FOR THEIR RELEASE."
HE ADDS THAT NEITHER THE SECURITY COUNCIL NOR THE PRESIDENT CAN BE
PREVENTED FROM ASCERTAINING INFORMATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE
RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.

   BARCO SAYS THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTERRORISM HAS NOT BEEN
EASY. HE ADDS THAT KEEPING THE HOPES OF THE NATION ALIVE, RATHER THAN
ENHANCING THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE, IS THE GOAL.  HE ADDS THAT THE COUNTRY
WILL NOT SURVIVE WITH ITS PROBLEMS, NOTING HIS UPCOMING EUROPEAN TRIP
TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE DANGERS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO REAFFIRM
THE COUNTRY'S GOOD NAME.

   IN ENDING HIS ADDRESS, BARCO URGES CALM AND WARNS AGAINST DIVISION,
ADDING THAT THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.  HE
URGES EVERYONE TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRACY.

   BARCO ENDS HIS ADDRESS AT 0250 GMT.

POLICE ELITE CORPS CARRIED OUT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE HIGHER PARTS
OF ENVIGADO MUNICIPALITY.

   2.  IN SAID OPERATIONS, THE ELITE CORPS ARRESTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS
FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA AND JOSE CRISTANTO RETAVISTA ARZON, WHO REMAIN
MISSING.

   3.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN MEDELLIN, IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF
THE ELITE CORPS TO ARREST PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM TO THE CARLOS HOLGUIN
POLICE ACADEMY, WHERE THEY ARE TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY MEMBERS OF THE
BOGOTA DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS], WHO
ARE IN THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA.

   4.  WE HAVE DENOUNCED THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,
BUT PRESIDENT BARCO HAS RESPONDED IN STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS THAT
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE ELITE CORPS ARE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY.

   5.  THE COMMANDER OF THE ELITE CORPS IN ANTIOQUIA, AND COLONEL
PELAEZ, CHIEF OF THE BOGOTA DIJIN, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF
ALL OUR COMRADES AND FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED
CITIZENS.

   6.  IN PREVIOUS COMMUNIQUES, WE PUBLICLY REQUESTED THE CREATION OF
SEPARATE PRISONS AND THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRANCH OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN SUCH PRISONS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT, AN
ACCOMPLICE, HAS BEEN SILENT WITH REGARD TO OUR PROPOSALS.

   7.  IF THE CITIZENS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN ENVIGADO ARE NOT PRESENTED
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES, IN REPRISAL WE WILL PLACE A BOMB
CONTAINING 5,000 KG OF DYNAMITE IN ONE OF THE MAIN RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA OLIGARCHY.

   8.  FOR EACH COLOMBIAN WHO IS TURNED OVER TO THE UNITED STATES, WE
WILL PLACE A 5,000-KG BOMB IN THE CAPITAL OF THE REPUBLIC.

   9.  WE WILL EXECUTE PROGOVERNMENT JUDGES, TRAITOROUS POLITICIANS,
TORTURERS, AND THE MAIN MEMBERS OF THE (CANO) FAMILY.

PRESIDENTS DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA, OSCAR ARIAS SANCHEZ, RAFAEL
LEONARDO CALLEJAS, MARCO VINICIO CEREZO AREVELO, ALFREDO CRISTIANI:

   IN EL SALVADOR A SERIOUS DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS BEGUN
THANKS TO THE MEDIATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS THROUGH ITS SECRETARY
GENERAL MR. JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  THIS IMPLIES THAT ANY PEACE
FORMULA MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT
IT IS BASED ON OUR PARTICULAR REALITY AND THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY
THIS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEGOTIATION'S MAIN OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, BECAUSE WHILE PEACEFUL CENTRAL AMERICAN AND
WORLD DEVELOPMENTS ARE MARKED BY A CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY, EL
SALVADOR IS QUITE FAR FROM EXPERIENCING THIS.

   THE ARMY HOLDS SOCIETY'S REAL POWER.  THIS PREVENTS JUSTICE BEING
APPLIED IN THE HORRENDOUS ASSASSINATIONS OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, JESUIT
PRIESTS, FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
MEMBERS, AND DR. HECTOR OQUELI.  UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, IMPUNITY
CONTINUES TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

   DAILY LIFE IS MARKED BY REPRESSION AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AN
FREQUENT MURDERS, WHILE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
APPLIES PRESSURES AND FORCES, BY VARIOUS MEANS, THE RESTRICTION OF
INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA BY LIMITING FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

   IT IS THEREFORE EVIDENT THAT EL SALVADOR IS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE MAIN GOALS OF ESQUIPULAS II -- THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND A
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   THIS SITUATION, WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A PERMANENT STATE OF SIEGE
IS WORSENED BY GREAT RESTRICTIONS ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT PREVENT
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIAN SOCIETY.

   IT SUFFICES TO MENTION THE CASE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM: IN
NICARAGUA, A COUNTRY WITH HALF OF OUR COUNTRY'S POPULATION, THE
SUPREME ELECTORAL COUNCIL REGISTERED 1.9 MILLION CITIZENS IN ONLY FOUR
SUNDAYS; IN EL SALVADOR, IN EIGHT YEARS, THE ELECTORAL REGISTRY
REGISTERED 1.6 MILLION CITIZENS FOR THE RECENT ELECTIONS AND ONLY 1
MILLION ACTUALLY VOTED.  [CONTINUED]

[CONTINUED] IN CONTRAST, EL SALVADOR, WHICH HAS THE SECOND LARGEST
POPULATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS THE SMALLEST PARLIAMENT WITH ONLY
60 DEPUTIES.

   THE SOCIAL CONFLICT IS WORSENED BY A WAR THAT NO ONE HAS WON.  THE
TIME HAS COME TO LET CIVILIAN SOCIETY WIN.  TO ACHIEVE THAT WE
REQUIRE:

   -- THE PURGING, RESTRUCTURING, AND REDUCTION OF THE ARMY AND
MOVEMENT TOWARD A CIVILIAN SOCIETY, AN ABSOLUTELY DEMILITARIZED
SOCIETY.

   -- THE END OF IMPUNITY THROUGH THE TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF THE
MASTERMINDS AND PERPETRATORS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR ROMERO,
FENASTRAS MEMBERS, JESUIT PRIESTS, AND DR. OQUELI.  THESE TRIALS ARE
THE FOUNDATION THAT WILL ENSURE THAT REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS
CREDIBLE.

   -- GUARANTEES OF THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES.

   -- VIA A PLESBICITE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS, THAT THE NEXT ASSEMBLY
IMPLEMENT AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, SUCH AS THE EXPANSION OF THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AND THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR THE DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY.

   -- REFORM OF THE ELECTORAL SYTEM TO REGISTER, BY MAY THIS YEAR AT
THE LATEST, NEARLY 3 MILLION ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS TO ALLOW THEM
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 1991 ELECTIONS.

   -- THE CARRYING OUT OF THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WITHOUT A MILITARY
PRESENCE AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AT
LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND UNTIL THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW
ASSEMBLY.

   THE FMLN IS WILLING TO REACH ACCORDS ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND TO
IMPLEMENT SIMULTANEOUS STEPS FROM A DE-INTENSIFICATION OF THE WAR AND
AN END OF HOSTILITIES TO ACCORDS TO END THE ARMED CONFLICT AND THE
REINCORPORATION OF OUR FORCES INTO POLITICAL LIFE IN KEEPING WITH AND
PARALLEL TO THE AFOREMENTIONED MEASURES TAKING PLACE.

   WE EXPRESS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FULLY SUPPORT A NATIONAL REGISTRATIO
DRIVE TO GIVE ALL ELIGIBLE SALVADORAN VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE
AND CONTRIBUTE TOWARD ENSURING THAT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, AS WAS THE
CASE IN NICARAGUA, WILL HELP ESTABLISH THE BASES FOR LASTING PEACE.

   PRESIDENTS: THE FMLN'S OBJECTIVES ARE DEMOCRATIZATION, RESPECT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF A GENUINE LEGAL STATE,
DEMILITARIZATION, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY AS
THE ONLY MEANS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL PEACEFULLY MOVE UP TO
BETTER LEVELS OF WELL-BEING AND DEVELOPMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, WE
BELIEVE THAT YOUR BEST CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE TO HELP PROMOTE
DEMOCRATIZATION IN EL SALVADOR AND TO ADVOCATE A NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS
THAT IS BEGUN AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

   BOGOTA, 31 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [REPORT] [JUAN JORGE FAUNDES] [TEXT]
KIDNAPPING IS ONE OF COLOMBIA'S MOST PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES TO THE
EXTENT THAT, ACCORDING TO POLICE STATISTICS, FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
KIDNAPPED EVERY DAY SO FAR IN 1990, A FIGURE DOUBLE THAT OF THE SAME
PERIOD IN 1989.  THE JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS DIRECTORATE
[DIJIN] THIS WEEK REPORTED THAT 326 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED FOR
EXTORTION PURPOSES SO FAR THIS YEAR.

   DIJIN SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS IN THIS PERIOD DOUBLED
THE NUMBER OF KIDNAPPINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1989.

   ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY [DAS], IN
1989, CATTLEMEN PAID 2 BILLION PESOS ($5 MILLION) TO KIDNAPPERS AND
BLACKMAILERS WHO THREATENED CAPTURING OR ASSASSINATING THEM IF THEY
FAILED TO PAY.

   ACCORDING TO DAS, GUERRILLAS OR CRIMINALS STOLE 10,000 HEAD OF
CATTLE IN 1989 AND HAVE STOLEN 1,500 OF THE ANIMALS SO FAR IN 1990.

   SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE, BOTH POLICE SOURCES AND THOSE WHO STUDY
THE COLOMBIAN REALITY, HAVE POINTED OUT THAT GUERRILLAS PARTICIPATE IN
20 TO 30 PERCENT OF THE KIDNAPPING BUSINESS AND COMMON CRIMINALS IN 70
TO 80 PERCENT.

   THESE PERCENTAGES OF PARTICIPATION IN THE INDUSTRY OF KIDNAPPING
ARE ONLY ESTIMATES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK BECAUSE IN MANY CASES
GUERRILLAS KIDNAP PEOPLE TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND DO NOT CLAIM
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

   IN ADDITION, MANY PEOPLE ARE KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS, BUT THE
CRIME IS REPORTED AS BEING PERPETRATED BY GUERRILLAS IN AN ATTEMPT TO
COVER UP THE MALEFACTOR'S ACTIONS.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS, CORDOBA, IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHEAST, IS THE
DEPARTMENT MOST AFFECTED BY THIS KIND OF CRIME.  OTHER HARD HIT
DEPARTMENTS ARE ANTIOQUIA IN THE NORTHWEST, SANTANDER IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND CAUCA IN THE SOUTHWEST.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO UNTENABLE
THAT ITS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTORE SOCIAL BALANCE IN CORDOBA ON A
MID-TERM BASIS BECAUSE THE POPULATION HAS ACCUSTOMED ITSELF TO
COEXISTING WITH THESE IRREGULARITIES OR REPULSING THEM WITH MECHANISMS
OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW.

   MECHANISMS OTHER THAN THOSE STIPULATED BY LAW REFERRED TO BY THE
DAS ARE USUALLY CATTLEMEN ORGANIZING THEMSELVES INTO SELF-DEFENSE
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OR DEATH SQUADS.

   THESE PARAMILITARY GROUPS DEFEND THEIR PROPERTIES OR MOUNT RAIDS
AGAINST PEASANTS CONSIDERED ACCOMPLICES OR INFORMANTS OF LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS OR COMMON CRIMINALS WHO BLACKMAIL THEM.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS, ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IS SOCIAL
DISRUPTION AND THE PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE COMMUNITIES
LOCATED IN MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCALITIES THAT LACK THE MOST BASIC
SERVICES, A REALITY THAT IS MOST GLARING IN CORDOBA.

   FIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE ACTIVE IN COLOMBIA.  THE MOST BELLIGERENT
AND THE ONE THAT HAS USED KIDNAPPING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IS THE
PRO-CASTRO NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY [ELN].

   THE OTHER GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF
COLOMBIA [FARC], THE MAOIST PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY [EPL], THE
INDIGENIST QUINTIN LAME, AND THE TROTSKYIST REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS'
PARTY [PRT].

   MADRID (SPAIN), 2 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE
GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN MADRID THIS AFTERNOON.  ON HIS
ARRIVAL HE SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, HECTOR ARENAS, AT BARAJAS
AIRPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARENAS] GUATEMALAN VICE PRESIDENT ROBERTO CARPIO
WHO IS NOW IN SPAIN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SUPORTS THE CONCILIATION
COUNCIL MEETING TAKING PLACE IN OSLO, WHERE TALKS ARE BEING HELD WITH
THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS TO PUT AN END TO THE CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE
WHICH THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING FOR YEARS;
SCORES OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD OR MISSING.  ACCORDING TO VICE PRESIDENT
CARPIO THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION TODAY IN NO WAY JUSTIFIES TERRORIST
ACTIONS OR ARMED MOVEMENTS.

   [CARPIO, IN PROGRESS] ...THIS IS GOOD PROGRESS AND IN THIS
CONNECTION TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COUNTRIES HAVE CHANGED.  IT IS NOT
THE GUATEMALA OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, WHEN THERE WERE AUTOCRATIC AND
MILITARY REGIMES.  TODAY WE ARE IN A PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND IN
THIS CONNECTION WE ALL OUGHT TO INVOLVE OURSELVES IN IT.  THEREFORE, I
THINK, THIS IS THE BEGINING OF SOMETHING WHICH COULD END THE ARMED
STRUGGLE IN GUATEMALA, AS IT SHOULD ALSO END THROUGHOUT ALL CENTRAL
AMERICA.  [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 3 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] DURING THE
SEARCHES TODAY IN MEDELLIN, THE CAPITAL OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THE
AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED WHAT THEY HAVE TERMED AS A VERY IMPORTANT
COMMUNICATIONS CENTER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   AS PART OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE OPERATIONS, IN RESPONSE TO THE
ATTACKS AGAINST ARMY MEMBERS IN MEDELLIN, THE AUTHORITIES TODAY
DISMANTLED A COMMUNICATIONS CENTER BELONGING TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.
IN A RESIDENCE LOCATED IN EL POBLADO NEIGHBORHOOD, THE AUTHORITIES
FOUND 15 PORTABLE COMMUNICATION RADIOS; TWO CORDLESS TELEPHONES; TWO
MAGNETIC ANTENNAS FOR RADIOS; THREE ICOM RECEIVERS; SEVEN BATTERIES;
12 ANTENNAS FOR PORTABLE RADIOS; FIVE VOLTAGE REGULATORS; AND FOUR
ADAPTERS.

   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT, DOCUMENTS LINKING SEVERAL PEOPLE
WITH THE ASSASSINATIONS OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO, BERNARDO
JARAMILLO OSSA, AND OF COLONEL VALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO WERE FOUND
AT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL COMMUNICATIONS CENTER, AS WELL AS DOCUMENTS
ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA, AND AGAINST THE
AVIANCA HK1803 PLANE.  POLICE SOURCES REPORTED THAT NO ARRESTS WERE
MADE.


DEV-MUC3-1207 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE
POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN
NICARAGUA AND THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE TO BE HELD IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT?  WILL THE ARMED FORCES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE
DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT?

   [PONCE] LAST WEEK THE ARMED FORCES RELEASED A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE
PEOPLE EXPLAINING THEIR STAND AND MENTIONING THREE BASIC POINTS:

   FIRST, THE ARMED FORCES SUPPORT A DIALOGUE THAT SEEKS PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY THROUGH MECHANISMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT.

   SECOND, THE ARMED FORCES EXPRESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC IN THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER EFFORTS HE MAY UNDERTAKE TO
FIND THE PEACE WE ALL CHERISH IN THIS COUNTRY.

   THIRD, WE POSSESS THE MORAL CONVICTION AND THE OBEDIENCE -- AS
ORDERED BY THE CONSTITUTION -- AS WELL AS THE HUMANISTIC AWARENESS TO
PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THOSE ARE THE BASIC POINTS INCLUDED IN OUR MESSAGE TO THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.

   AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT BEING HELD IN NICARAGUA, THE ARMED
FORCES WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT
TO FIND THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE IN THE REGION.  THAT
IS WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
ENDEAVOUR FOR FINDING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AMERICA.

   CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE
WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE
MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DO THE ARMED FORCES THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT BOMBS
THAT WERE DETONATED YESTERDAY AND KILLED SIX SOLDIERS AND ONE
CIVILIAN?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT
EXPLOSIVES ARE AGAIN BEING USED AGAINST THE PEOPLE?

   [PONCE] WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED
OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A
MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS WHAT WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1208 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [CONTINUED] [PONCE]
THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN HISTORY.  THEY HAD CLEARLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT USE CAR BOMBS FROM NOW ON, BUT THEY USED
ONE YESTERDAY NEVERTHELESS.  THIS ACTION IS CONDEMNABLE FROM EVERY
VIEWPOINT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS, RATHER THE ALUMNI, OF CETIPOL [POLICE
INSTRUCTION CENTER] WHO WERE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK WERE UNARMED.
THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING SOME PHYSICAL EXERCISES.  IT IS ALSO DEPLORABLE
THAT A BAKER WAS KILLED AND THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD YOUTH GOING TO SCHOOL
WAS INJURED.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL TO THE
CREATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR SEEKING PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.  THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY
OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO
CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES.  ALL
THESE ACTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUR.  WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN
LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, REFERRING TO THE STATE OF SIEGE, WILL THE ARMED
FORCES INSIST ON KEEPING IT OR NOT?  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THIS YESTERDAY.

   [PONCE] THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION ANYWAY, AND IT IS ADOPTED BY
THE ASSEMBLY -- SOMETIMES UPON REQUEST FROM...

   [REPORTER, INTERRUPTING] THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, YOU SAID.

   [PONCE] WE, AS AN ARMED CORPS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY, WILL MAKE
NO REQUEST TO EXTEND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ARMED FORCES DECIDED THIS
BECAUSE THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS DISAPPEARED?

   [PONCE] TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS
MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN LEADERS, WE BELIEVE
THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS
NO VIOLENCE.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROPITIOUS ATMOSPHERE
FOR THE DIALOGUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO LIFT IT.

   [REPORTER] I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION
REGARDING [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [PONCE] AS FOR THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU ARE REFERRING TO STATEMENTS
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.  I BELIEVE THAT IN DUE TIME HE WILL
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THOSE STATEMENTS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE NEWSMAN DISTORTED HIS WORDS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE RESPECTIVE CLARIFICATION.

   I WILL, HOWEVER, STATE THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AS TO WHETHER AT
ANY TIME COLONEL BENAVIDES HAS LEFT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
HE CLEARLY SAID THAT AT NO TIME HAS BENAVIDES DONE THIS.  HE IS UNDER
THE ORDERS OF THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE, AND AT NO TIME HAS THE 4TH PENAL
JUDGE AUTHORIZED COL. BENAVIDES TO LEAVE THE CONFINES OF THE JAIL.

   THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE, A
PHOTOGRAPH FOR EXAMPLE.  OTHERWISE, THIS IS ALL MERE SPECULATION.
THAT IS A VERY DELICATE CASE, AND SPECULATIONS CAST A NEGATIVE IMAGE
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF, AND EVEN ON THE
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   CONCERNING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE MURDER OF THE
JESUITS, THE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES WILL DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE DONE.  WE
WILL RESPECT THAT DECISION.  [CONTINUED]

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 4 APR 90 (CIRCUITO RPC TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
APPROXIMATELY 800 HEAVILY ARMED COLOMBIANS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS
WERE DISCOVERED CONDUCTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AT THE BORDER BETWEEN PANAMA
AND COLOMBIA, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO ARIAS
CALDERON.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARIAS CALDERON] THERE ARE COLOMBIANS WITHOUT
IDENTIFICATION AT THE BORDER.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN
ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.  THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN PUERTO OBALDIA,
IN WHICH A NATIONAL POLICEMAN WAS KILLED BY SOME COLOMBIAN NATIONALS.
THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  THE COLOMBIAN NATIONALS HAVE NOT YET BEEN
IDENTIFIED.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH INCIDENTS ARE LINKED.  WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE MINISTRY WILL TAKE
THE PROPER MEASURES AT THE PROPER TIME.

   [REPORTER] DO YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THEY ARE
CONDUCTING THERE NOW?

   [ARIAS CALDERON] THEY ARE PROBABLY CONDUCTING CONTRABAND- RELATED
ACTIVITIES. [END RECORDING] 


DEV-MUC3-1210 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 30 MAR 90 (DIARIO LATINO) -- [TEXT] INTERNATIONAL NEWS
DISPATCHES HAVE REPORTED ON PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S REMARKS ABOUT WHY
THE NEFARIOUS DEATH SQUADS HAVE APPEARED AND STILL THRIVE IN THE COUNTRY.

   CRISTIANI'S REMARKS, MADE IN CARACAS, HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF
CONCERN FOR LOCAL AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS BECAUSE HE USES A STRANGE AND
TWISTED LOGIC TO ANALYZE THE SALVADORAN SOCIAL REALITY.  HE HAS SAID
THAT THE DEATH SQUADS APPEARED IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  EVEN WORSE, HE SAID
THAT THESE SQUADS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN OUR COUNTRY AS LONG AS
THE FMLN CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT POLITICAL AND MILITARY ACTIVITIES.

   CRISTIANI'S REMARKS HAVE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF UDN, WHICH CANNOT
HELP BUT REJECT AND REFUTE ASSERTIONS DESIGNED TO CONFUSE THE LOCAL
AND FOREIGN PUBLIC OPINION ON THE TRUE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE IN THE
COUNTRY AND THE FMLN'S APPEARANCE AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE NATIONAL
SCENARIO.

   FIRST, CRISTIANI'S ASSERTIONS REPRESENT MORAL SUPPORT FOR THE
GROUPS AND BANDS OF ASSASSINS WHO, EMBEDDED IN AND PROTECTED BY THE
STRUCTURES OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER, HAVE ASSASSINATED WITH
IMPUNITY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOWLY SALVADORANS.

   SECOND, CRISTIANI MISTAKES THE CASE FOR THE EFFECT BY SAYING THAT
"VIOLENCE ENGENDERS VIOLENCE" AND THAT, THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE DEATH
SQUADS AS LONG AS THERE ARE GUERRILLAS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE DEATH
SQUADS WERE ACTIVE EVEN BEFORE THE FMLN WAS ORGANIZED.  HAS CRISTIANI
PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY THE WHITE HAND [LA
MANO BLANCA], THE WHITE WAR UNION [LA UNION GUERRA BLANCA], AND OTHER
GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN SPREADING TERROR FOR MANY YEARS?

   THIRD, VIOLENCE AND HOSTILITY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT IN EL
SALVADOR SINCE THE SPANISH INVASION AND CONQUEST AND WORKERS HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN FAVORITE VICTIMS.

   WE HEREBY STATE THIS, FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.
THE VIOLENCE OF THE PEOPLE HAS RESPONDED, AS A LAST DITCH RESORT, TO
THE GENERALIZED VIOLENCE OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND STATE.

   LET US KEEP IN MIND OUR FOREBEARS' RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH
INVADERS; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' PERSISTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE
SOCIAL INJUSTICE OF COLONIAL TIMES; THE HEROIC ACTIONS AND THE
PATRIOTIC ATTEMPTS THAT CULMINATED IN INDEPENDENCE; ANASTASIO AQUINO'S
REBELLION; THE PEASANTS' AND INDIANS' RESISTANCE TO WORKING FOR THE
NEW LANDOWNERS WHO DISPOSSESSED THEM OF THEIR COMMON LANDS DURING THE
1881 AGRARIAN REFORM; THE REBELLION OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS IN 1932;
THE HISTORIC ACTION AGAINST DICTATOR MARTINEZ IN 1944; THE RANK AND
FILE STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANT LEMUS; THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE AGAINST THE
ELECTORAL IMPOSITION IN THE 1970'S; AND THE UNYIELDING STRUGGLE OF AN
ENTIRE PEOPLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, WHICH IS
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1211 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER SANCHO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[REPORTER] COMMANDER, THE FIGHTERS, EVEN SALVADORAN CITIZENS IN
GENERAL, DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN ATTITUDES OF THE FMLN OR SOME OF
THE COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  WE SPENT EIGHT OR
NINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE.  WE REMEMBER [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ASSASSINATION OF
HERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA.  HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS
ISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE
PEACEFULLY.  HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF
POSITION BY THE FMLN?

   [SANCHO] AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT
ADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY
DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED.  WE ALSO HAVE TO
MENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.  THE TRUCE WAS A
GESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
TO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

   THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL
OR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF
THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME
HIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO WAS IN POWER FOR
ALMOST 10 YEARS, AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON?  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS?

   [SANCHO] WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY.  HE
HAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD
CHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT.  OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A
CRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE.  I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON
IS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY
AS A DEPUTY.  HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHO IS
WELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR.

   [REPORTER] TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY.
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT?

   [SANCHO] A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT
MUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND
NATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD
THE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY.
THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT.  I BELIEVE
THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOR CONCERTED
POLITICAL EFFORTS, WHICH WILL REALLY GIVE NEW HOPE TO THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE SPEAK ON
BEHALF OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE
MAJORITIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 APR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] FIVE SOLDIERS WERE
KILLED AND FIVE WERE WOUNDED DURING A FIERCE GUERRILLA ATTACK THIS
MORNING IN THE CITY OF SUCHITOTO, CUZCATLAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL
PART OF THE COUNTRY, MILITARY SPOKESPERSONS HAVE REPORTED.

   THE SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE REBEL ATTACK BY RIFLE FIRE BEGAN AT
0120 TODAY AND LASTED FOR FOUR HOURS.  AFTER THIS, THE ARMY WAS IN
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  THE NUMBER OF REBEL CASUALTIES IS NOT
KNOWN.

   THE FIGHTING BEGAN WHEN FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) GUERRILLAS ATTACKED THE LAS GUARAS BRIDGE GUARD POST IN THE
CITY OF SUCHITOTO, 44 KM FROM SAN SALVADOR.

   THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID THAT EARLY THIS MORNING THE ARMY WAS IN
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  HOWEVER, ARTILLERY UNITS ARE CONDUCTING A
COMBING OPERATION IN AN EFFORT TO CAPTURE THE REBELS.

   GUERRILLAS ACTIVITIES HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AFTER
THE FMLN SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT LAST WEDNESDAY IN
GENEVA (SWITZERLAND) TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE TO RESOLVE THE 10-YEAR
CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.

   FMLN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED ARMED FORCES POSITIONS IN THE NORTHERN AND
SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE CAPITAL FOR MORE THAN A HALF HOUR YESTERDAY,
RESULTING IN TWO REBELS BEING KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED, ACCORDING TO
MILITARY REPORTS.

   THE FMLN HAS ALSO INTENSIFIED ITS SABOTAGE OF ELECTRICITY PYLONS,
ABOVE ALL IN THE CAPITAL.  THIS WEEK THE FMLN REBELS BROUGHT DOWN AT
LEAST 20 ELECTRICITY PYLONS, CAUSING POWER OUTAGES IN DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THE COUNTRY.  


DEV-MUC3-1214 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 6 APR 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE CRIMINAL DRUG MAFIAS OPERATING
IN COLOMBIA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL INCREASE THEIR TERRORIST
ATTACKS ON "THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY" IN RESPONSE TO THE
ALLEGED DISAPPEARANCE OF SEVERAL OF THEIR ACCOMPLICES.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT BY TELEFAX TO SEVERAL NEWS MEDIA, "THE
EXTRADITABLES," SPOKESMEN FOR THE MAFIAS, SAID THAT THEIR "WAR" WILL
BE CARRIED OUT HENCEFORTH BECAUSE OF THE "DISAPPEARANCE, TORTURE, AND
ASSASSINATION" OF SEVERAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS AT THE HANDS OF THE
DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS (DIJIN).

   ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, WHO AGAIN DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS A
"POLITICAL-MILITARY" ORGANIZATION, "THE PROBLEM OF THE EXTRADITION HAS
BEEN RELEGATED TO A SECONDARY STATUS, SINCE OUR MAIN MOTIVE FOR THE
WAR WILL BE THE TORTURE, ASSASSINATION, AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR
COMRADES."

   A FEW DAYS AGO, IN A SIMILAR MESSAGE, THE CRIMINALS SAID THAT THEY
WOULD PLACE 5-TON DYNAMITE BOMBS IN "NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE BOGOTA
OLIGARCHY," IN REPRISAL FOR OFFENSIVE ACTIONS BY THE AUTHORITIES.

   YESTERDAY, A CAR-BOMB WITH 800 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS LEFT BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS IN AN EXCLUSIVE SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL.  HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR A DEFECT IN THE DETONATOR, IT WOULD HAVE KILLED AT LEAST 5,000
[NUMBER AS RECEIVED] PEOPLE.

   ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINALS, THE RESURGENCE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IS
DUE TO THE "DISAPPEARANCE" LATE LAST MONTH OF JOSE RETAVISTA GARZON,
FREDDY LOPEZ OSPINA, AND BROTHERS OMAR AND GUILLERMO PEREA RIVERA, WHO
REPORTEDLY WERE ARRESTED BY THE POLICE IN THE NORTHWESTERN TOWN OF
ENVIGADO.

   HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT YESTERDAY BY THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THESE PERSONS ARE NOT CONFINED IN ANY
GARRISON OF THE ELITE FORCE, A POLICE ANTITERRORIST CORPS.

   "THE EXTRADITABLES" NOTED THAT "THE GOOD FAITH OF THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE IN NO WAY SATISFIES OUR DEMANDS, BECAUSE THE MISSING
COMPANIONS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE SCHOOL (POLICE HEADQUARTERS) AND
EXECUTED BY ORDER OF DIJIN DIRECTOR OSCAR PELAEZ CARMONA, WHOM THEY
ACCUSE OF "MASTERMINDING" SEVERAL MASSACRES.

   THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA ALSO SAID THAT THE KILLINGS OF POLICEMEN
HAD BEEN SUSPENDED (14 UNIFORMED POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
MEDELLIN SINCE LAST MONDAY) AND THAT THEY HAD NEVER PARTICIPATED IN
"TORTURE," BUT, THEY ADDED, "WE WILL INTENSIFY OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, WHICH IS AN ACCOMPLICE TO THE
ASSASSINATIONS."

   THE WAR AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIAS IN COLOMBIA, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE
EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT RESURGENCE, BEGAN LAST AUGUST AFTER MERCENARIES
AT THE SERVICE OF THE CRIMINAL GROUPS ASSASSINATED IN THE SPACE OF A
FEW HOURS A MAGISTRATE, A POLICE COLONEL, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   CLANDESTINE, 6 APR 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN REPORTED
THAT ON 6 APRIL AT 0230, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
GUERRILLAS ATTACKED POSITIONS THAT WERE BEING GUARDED BY UNITS OF THE
LIGHTNING BATTALION OF MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 5 IN LAS GUARAS BRIDGE,
LOCATED ON THE HIGHWAY THAT RUNS FROM SAN MARTIN TO SUCHITOTO, AND IN SAN
PEDRO PERULAPAN, CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT.  THE FMLN GUERRILLAS ATTACKED FOUR
POSITIONS WITH RIFLE FIRE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS.

   AFTER 40 MINUTES OF ATTACKS, WE HAD TAKEN OVER THREE POSITIONS AND
FORCED THE FOURTH ONE TO FLEE.  IN THIS ATTACK, WE INFLICTED 13
CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY.  THE CASUALTIES WERE INFLICTED IN THE AREA OF
SUCHITOTO, WHILE THE WAR MATERIEL WGS SEIZED IN SAN PEDRO PERULAPAN IN
CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT.

   WE INFLICTED 13 CASUALTIES IN THE AREA OF SUCHITOTO, INCLUDING A
SUB-SERGEANT AND A WOUNDED CORPORAL.  IN THE AREA OF THE LAS GUARAS
BRIDGE, WE SEIZED FIVE M-16 RIFLES, ONE M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHER, 8,200
CARTRIDGES, 38 GRENADES FOR M-79 ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 11 KNAPSACKS, AND
OTHER WAR MATERIEL.

   WE ALSO REPORT THAT COMRADE WILLIAM HEROICALLY FELL IN COMBAT,
STRUGGLING TO TEAR DOWN THE FASCIST WALL AND URGING THE FATHERLAND TO

   PARIS (FRANCE), 5 APRIL 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN LEADER
VIRGILIO BARCO BRIEFED FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND HERE
WEDNESDAY ON THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOGOTA TO FIGHT THE COUNTRY'S
POWERFUL COCAINE TRAFFICKERS.

   MR. BARCO TOLD REPORTERS AFTER THE MEETING AT THE ELYSEE PALACE
THAT THE FRENCH LEADER, WHO VISITED BOGOTA IN OCTOBER 1989, HAD SAID
ONCE AGAIN THAT HE WAS "VERY INTERESTED" IN THE DRUG PROBLEM.

   FRENCH SOURCES SAID THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HAD INFORMED MR.
MITTERRAND OF THE EFFORTS TAKEN BY HIS GOVERNMENT AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND DESCRIBED THEM AS ENCOURAGING.

   MR. BARCO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT CONTROLLING IMPORTS OF CHEMICALS NEEDED BY TRAFFICKERS TO MAKE
COCAINE.  ASKED ABOUT BRINGING MEMBERS OF A POWERFUL GROUP OF DRUG
BARONS KNOWN AS THE "THE EXTRADITABLES" TO TRIAL, MR. BARCO SAID IT
WOULD "DEPEND ON EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE."

   THE TWO PRESIDENTS ALSO DISCUSSED THE COFFEE MARKET, FRENCH SOURCES
SAID.  COFFEE IS COLOMBIA'S MAIN LEGAL CASH CROP, AND PRICES HAVE
PLUNGED IN THE PAST YEAR WITH THE COLLAPSE OF A MARKET AGREEMENT
BETWEEN PRODUCER AND CONSUMER COUNTRIES.

   MR. BARCO VISITED STRASBOURG, EASTERN FRANCE, EARLIER WEDNESDAY
WHERE HE ADDRESSED THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY PARLIAMENT AND
APPEALED FOR EASIER ACCESS TO EUROPEAN MARKETS FOR COLOMBIAN GOODS.
IN AN ADDRESS TO THE BODY, MR. BARCO ASKED THE EEC TO REDUCE CUSTOMS
DUTIES ON COFFEE.  MR. BARCO, WHO HANDED OUT PACKETS OF COLOMBIAN
COFFEE TO EURO-MPS [MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT], ALSO ASKED THE COMMUNITY
TO LIFT TARIFFS ON FLOWERS, AND QUOTAS ON THE QUANTITY OF BANANAS
EXPORTED TO THE 12 EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY NATIONS.

   EARLY IN THE SPEECH, ECOLOGIST MPS HELD UP SIGNS LISTING VICTIMS OF
ALLEGED COLOMBIAN ARMY "ASSASSINATIONS."  THE PRESIDENT OF PARLIAMENT,

   LIMA, 7 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE "SHINING PATH" TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION IS KEEPING THREE PERUVIAN CITIES UNDER PRESSURE WITH
THREE "ARMED STRIKES"-- STRIKES ENFORCED BY DEATH THREATS--THAT BEGAN
TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE A BOYCOTT OF TOMORROW'S GENERAL ELECTIONS.

   AYACUCHO, THE CAPITAL OF THE SOUTHERN DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO, IS
UNDER A STATE OF MILITARY EMERGENCY.  THERE IS NEITHER ELECTRICITY NOR
WATER IN THE CITY, AND EVERY ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT
OF THE THREE-DAY "ARMED STRIKE" CALLED AS OF TODAY.  THERE IS NO
TRANSPORTATION EITHER, STORES ARE CLOSED, AND THE STREEETS ARE
PATROLLED BY THE ARMY AND THE MILITARY POLICE.  ROADS LINKING AYACUCHO
WITH THE DEPARTMENTAL PROVINCES OF CANGALLADO AND LA MAR WERE BLOCKED
BY SHINING PATH TERRORISTS WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS.  THE 55-KM
ROAD LINKING AYACUCHO WITH THE CITY OF HUANTA IS GUARDED BY 4,000
MEMBERS OF THE "PEASANT PATROLS," WHICH ARE OPPOSED TO THE "SHINING
PATH."  THERE ARE A FEW VANS ON THE ROAD, UNDER MILITARY SURVEILLANCE.
"SHINING PATH" TERRORISTS HAVE DESTROYED A SUSPENSION BRIDGE LINKING
AYACUCHO WITH THE PROVINCE OF JULCAMARCA, WHICH WAS THUS FORCED INTO
ISOLATION.

   CANDIDATES FOR DEPUTY FROM AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT FOR THE RULING APRA
(AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE), THE VARGAS LLOSA-LED
DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), AND THE UNITED LEFT, AS WELL AS FOREIGN
AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS WHO WILL COVERING THE ELECTION IN THAT AREA ARE
ALL LODGED IN A HOTEL IN AYACUCHO.  "SHINING PATH" HAS THREATENED TO
BLOW UP THE HOTEL, WHICH IS HEAVILY GUARDED BY THE POLICE.

   MEANWHILE, THE PEOPLE OF AYACUCHO ARE CHECKING THE VOTER LISTS TO
FIND OUT WHERE EACH VOTER WILL HAVE TO CAST HIS VOTE TOMORROW.

   THE SHINING PATH ALSO CALLED FOR AN "ARMED STRIKE" FROM TODAY UNTIL
MONDAY IN HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, BORDERING LIMA
DEPARTMENT TO THE NORTH.  THE CITY WAS PARALYZED AND IN THE DARK
FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF A HIGH-TENSION PYLON SIX KM FROM THE
CITY.  AS THE RESULT OF THAT ATTACK, FIVE PROVINCES OF ANCASH WERE
LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

   THE SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HURLED EXPLOSIVES AT A MARKET IN
HUARAZ, INJURING 15 PEOPLE.  THE HUARAZ-LIMA ROAD WAS BLOCKED FOR 15
HOURS WHEN SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS SET TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH MINERALS
ON FIRE.  ANCASH DEPARTMENT LIES OUTSIDE THE AREA UNDER THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY THAT ENCOMPASSES HALF OF PERU, INCLUDING THE METROPOLITAN
LIMA AREA.

   HUANCAYO, 415 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, IS COMPLETELY PARALYZED BY THE
"ARMED STRIKE" IMPOSED BY THE SHINING PATH. ALL ACTIVITIES-- BANKS,
COMMERCE, MARKETS, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION--HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. SINCE
FRIDAY THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT BOMBINGS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
FACILITIES.  A CAR WAS DESTROYED BY A BOMB.  THE CITY'S ELECTRICITY
SUPPLY HAS BEEN CUT, FOLLOWING THE DESTRUCTION OF THREE HIGH-TENSION
PYLONS.  ALSO AFFECTED WAS THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IN THE ENTIRE
MANTARO RIVER VALLEY, WHERE THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST HYDROELECTRIC PLANT
IS LOCATED. THIS PLANT SUPPLIES 80 PERCENT OF PERU'S ELECTRICITY.

   SINCE LAST YEAR, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDING THEIR
ACTIVITIES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO TO THE STRATEGIC DEPARTMENT
OF JUNIN, BORDERING THE DEPARTMENT OF LIMA. JUNIN PROVIDES MOST OF
LIMA'S FOOD.

ANNOUNCED THAT SENATOR FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ, ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT LEADERS OF COLOMBIA'S LIBERAL PARTY, WAS KIDNAPPED BY
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN MEDELLIN TODAY.

   ESTRADA VELEZ, 64, WAS INTERCEPTED NEAR THE ATANASIO GIRARDOT

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 APR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COLONEL INOCENTE
MONTANO, SALVADORAN DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER, TODAY ADMITTED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEIZURE OF AN ARMS SHIPMENT IN HONDURAS ON 7
APRIL MAY MEAN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE PLANNING A NEW
MILITARY OFFENSIVE.

   ACCORDING TO MONTANO, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) MAY LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE BEFORE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT- ELECT
VIOLETA CHAMORRO ASSUMES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL.

   "WE MUST NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SALVADORAN
TERRORISTS MIGHT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIONS BEFORE THE SANDINISTS
RELINQUISH POWER IN ORDER TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF ANTAGONISM AGAINST
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN MANAGUA AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE
STRENGTH," THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE ARMS SHIPMENT SEIZED
BY HONDURAN AUTHORITIES ON SATURDAY CONSISTS OF 24 AK-47 RIFLES, 24
HANDLES AND 76 CLIPS FOR THOSE WEAPONS, 80 ROLLS OF "SLOW FUSE"
WEIGHING OVER 2 KG EACH, AND A "LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS TO
MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES."

   THE MILITARY MATERIAL WAS BEING CARRIED IN A TRUCK BY SALVADORANS
VICTOR EMILIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA, WHO "WERE PART OF LOGISTICS
UNIT," OF THE FMLN, ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE
ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) TODAY.

   COPREFA ADDED THAT THIS FMLN "LOGISTICS UNIT" WAS IN CHARGE OF "THE
ARMS SMUGGLING TO EL SALVADOR."

   ON 8 APRIL, ANOTHER "LARGE QUANTIITY OF MEDICINE AND SURGICAL
SUPPLIES" WAS SEIZED IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF COPAN, WHERE THE
ARMS CARGO HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE, COPREFA REPORTED.

   "THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AGAIN CALL ON CITIZENS TO REPORT ALL
SORTS OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR
COMMUNITIES AND THUS AVERT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE FMLN,"
COPREFA SAID IN A COMMNIQUE RELEASED TONIGHT.

   THE CHARGES REGARDING THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS AND MEDICINE HAVE BEEN
RAISED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE PREPARING TO
RESUME THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE UNDER UN SPONSORSHIP, PROBABLY EARLY
NEXT MONTH.

   THE DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER NOTED THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS
"ONGOING" BUT ADDED THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS "HINDER THE
NEGOTIATIONS."

   MONTANO MADE THE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS DURING THE FUNERAL OF OTTO
SORTO MILLA, SON-IN-LAW OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE CHIEF (GENERAL
RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA) WHO DIED YESTERDAY, 17 DAYS AFTER AN ATTACK IN
WHICH HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND FOR WHICH THE GUERRILLAS CLAIMED
CREDIT.

BUENAVVENTURA, PASTO, PEREIRA, AND POPAYAN, A CITY WHICH WAS DESTROYED

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN MILITARY
SPOKESMEN REVEALED TODAY THAT A REBEL CELL, IN WHICH TWO HONDURAN
WOMEN ARE MEMBERS, CLANDESTINELY INTRODUCED INTO THE COUNTRY, THROUGH
HONDURAS, SEVERAL PISTOLS, THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, SOVIET
RIFLES, MEDICINE, AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE GUERRILLAS.

   IN THE FIRST REPORT, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SAID DEFINITIVELY THAT
"THE WEAPONS CAME FROM NICARAGUA, THROUGH HONDURAS, DESTINED FOR
TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE SECOND MILITARY REPORT ON THIS MATTER SAID THAT "THE NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS HAVE NOW MADE STEPPED-UP GUN-RUNNING
FROM THAT COUNTRY A SHORT TERM POSSIBILITY, NOT ONLY FOR OUR COUNTRY
BUT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SAID THAT THE ARMS
AND MEDICINE WERE INTRODUCED INTO EL SALVADOR IN 19 TRIPS OVER A
YEAR'S TIME FROM SAN PEDRO SULA (HONDURAS).

   THE MILITARY SOURCE SAID THAT THE REBEL CELL, CONSISTING OF
SALVADORANS TITO OLIVIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA SORTO AND HONDURAN
WOMEN ADILIA AND AMINTA DUBON RAMIREZ, "HAD THE MISSION" OF SECRETLY
TRANSPORTING ARMS AND MEDICINE INTO THE COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY COMMUNIQUE, 155 AK-47 RIFLES, 45 PISTOLS,
60,000 ROUNDS FOR VARIOUS CALIBER RIFLES, 126 GRENADES FOR RPG-7'S,
MEDICINE, AND MATERIALS FOR MAKING EXPLOSIVES WERE CLANDESTINELY
BROUGHT INTO EL SALVADOR BETWEEN APRIL 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990.

   TITO DUBON AND GARCIA SORTO WERE ARRESTED ON 7 APRIL IN COLOLACA
MUNICIPALITY, IN HONDURAS' LEMPIRA DEPARTMENT, WHILE TRYING TO
INTRODUCE THE ARMS SHIPMENT INTO THE COUNTRY INSIDE THE SECRET
COMPARTMENTS OF A TRUCK.

   ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INFORMATION, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) CELL USED TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES FOR THE TRIPS,
DEPARTING FROM THE CITY OF SAN PEDRO SULA.

   "ON ROUTE 1, 12 TRIPS WERE MADE BETWEEN JUNE 1989 AND 7 APRIL 1990.
ROUTE 2 WAS USED FOR THREE TRIPS BETWEEN APRIL AND MAY 1989 TO A PLACE
LOCATED IN MERCEDES, OCOTEPEQUE DEPARTMENT, WHERE THE FMLN TERRORISTS
PICKED UP THE WEAPONS AND OTHER WAR MATERIEL," THE DEFENSE MINISTRY
REPORTED.

   THE REPORT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE ROUTE USED FOR THE REMAINING FOUR
TRIPS, IN WHICH THE SAME FOUR PEOPLE TOOK PART.

   THE TWO HONDURAN WOMEN, NOW UNDER DETENTION, GAVE THE SALVADORANS
FALSE DOCUMENTATION TO PASS AS HONDURANS, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY
INVESTIGATIONS.  


DEV-MUC3-1225 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   HAVANA (CUBA), 5 APR 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [TEXT] VARIOUS
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE THE MEETING IN OSLO,
NORWAY'S CAPITAL.  AT THE END OF MARCH, A GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY [URNG] DELEGATION, REPRESENTING ITS GENERAL COMMAND, MET WITH A
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION [CNR] DELEGATION, ACCREDITED TO SUPPORT
THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMY TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE VERY
GRAVE CRISIS THAT IS AFFECTING THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL.  IT IS WORTH NOTING
THAT THE POLITICAL WILL AND BROAD INITIATIVE REPEATEDLY DISPLAYED BY THE
URNG GENERAL COMMAND, WHICH SEEKS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL ARMED
CONFLICT WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION, HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD WELCOME AMONG THE
POPULATION AND HAS CAUSED GREAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS
RESULTING IN THE APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF A BROAD AND REPRESENTATIVE SEGMENT
OF GUATEMALAN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS.

   AS MAY BE RECALLED, IT HAS BEEN THE MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT WHO
HAVE OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TALK TO THE GUATEMALAN ARMED INSURGENTS.
THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE WEAKNESSES, ISOLATION, AND CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN
THE ARMY AND THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  THE ARMY'S SECTOR
MOST RELUCTANT TO TALK WITH THE GUERRILLAS IS BENT ON RESOLVING
GUATEMALA'S ARMED CONFLICT BY WAY OF THE MILITARY, NOTWITHSTANDING
THAT IT CONTRADICTORILY REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE.

   IT IS THIS SECTOR THAT THE TROOPS AND SOME OFFICERS -- NOT
PRECISELY THE SELF-NAMED MOUNTAIN OFFICERS -- BLAME FOR THE HARD
SETBACKS AND SEVERE BLOWS INFLICTED BY THE GUERRILLA FORCES, THE
FAILURE OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY, AND THE ARMY BEING BOGGED
DOWN.  FOR THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE
SITUATION IS SOMETHING LIKE AN ALLEY, THE WAY OUT OF WHICH COULD BE
SEEN IF DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMAJO OPTED TO FOLLOW AND
RESPECT THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE OSLO AGREEMENTS.

   IN THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT JUST SIMPLY ENDING AN
UNDECLARED WAR THAT HAS LASTED NEARLY 30 YEARS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE
GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES, THE HELP OF ALL WHO FAVOR DEMOCRACY AND
PEACE IS NEEDED TO LAY DOWN THE BASIS FOR A GREAT NATIONAL ACCORD THAT
WILL ENSURE FOR GUATEMALA A SERIOUS PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS SO
AS TO RESOLVE THE HISTORIC AND ROOT STRUCTURAL CAUSES THAT HAVE
GENERATED THE DOMESTIC ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH STILL REMAINS INTACT.
THESE JUSTIFY AND GIVE VALIDITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROJECT, AND THE
PATRIOTIC AND POPULAR STRUGGLE BY THE ARMED GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT.

   COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASIC AGREEMENT TO SEEK PEACE
THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS, SIGNED IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL ON 30 APRIL,
DEPENDS THEN ON THE WILL AND POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF THE SIDES IN THE
CONFLICT.  THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PRECISELY THE ONES WHO
HAVE SHOWN THE MOST WILLINGNESS AND WILL, AND WHO HAVE MADE THE MOST
EFFORTS IN FAVOR OF PEACE IN GUATEMALA.  THEIR WIDESPREAD POLITICAL
AND DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND THEIR MEANINGFUL ADVANCES IN THE
BATTLEFIELD PERMIT THE INSURGENTS TO SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
WITH ENOUGH RESOURCES AND CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE OSLO
AGREEMENTS ARE RESPECTED AND COMPLIED WITH; THAT GUATEMALA ENTERS INTO
A TRUE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY IN ITS INSTITUTIONS AND STRUCTURES, WITH
BROAD NATIONAL SUPPORT AND INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY; AND THAT PEACE IS
REESTABLISHED -- AN HONORABLE PEACE WITH DIGNITY THAT GUARANTEES
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND INDEPENDENCE, PROGRESS, AND WELLBEING.

   SANTIAGO, 7 APR 90 (FORTIN MAPOCHO) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] THROUGH
HIS SPOKESMAN, U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL
VISIT CHILE IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICAL EVENT
DEMONSTRATES THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE COUNTRY
SINCE THE 14 DECEMBER 1989 ELECTIONS.

   THE ISOLATION HAS BEEN BROKEN AFTER A 16-YEAR PERIOD, AND IMPORTANT
WORLD PERSONALITIES ARE BEGINNING TO VISIT US.

   ITALY HAS CONSIDERED CHILE TO BE ONE OF ITS FIRST PRIORITIES FOR
ECONOMIC AID AND TRADE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRY AND BULGARIA
WERE RESUMED ON FRIDAY AFTER 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  PREVIOUSLY,
OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES TOOK THE SAME PATH, AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW
DAYS AGO THAT THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT VISITED OUR CAPITAL TO CONFIRM
THAT LINKS HAD BEEN RESUMED BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.

   IN GENERAL PINOCHET'S OPINION, CHILE WAS AT WAR FOR THE 16 YEARS OF
THE DICTATORSHIP.  CURIOUSLY, THE ALLEGED ALLIED CAMP, THE WESTERN
COUNTRIES THROUGH THEIR CHIEFS OF STATE, REFUSED TO TALK WITH HIM OR
EXTEND HIM INVITATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, IT WAS CONSIDERED DISGRACEFUL TO
HAVE ANY LINKS WITH THE REIGNING REGIME THAT HAD VIOLATED EVERY TYPE
OF HUMAN RIGHT ACCORDING TO 16 SENTENCES HANDED DOWN BY THE UNITED
NATIONS.

   FOR THE UNITED STATES, RELATIONS WITH CHILE WERE ANNOYING AND THAT
COUNTRY MADE IT KNOWN.  THE DICTATORSHIP'S COMMANDOS TRAVELLED TO
WASHINGTON TO KILL ORLANDO LETELIER.  FOR THIS OPERATION THEY VIOLATED
BORDERS AND LAWS WITH FALSE PASSPORTS TO CONDUCT THIS TERRORIST ACT
THAT IS STILL CONSIDERED A BLACK MARK AGAINST CHILEAN JUSTICE.

   NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF CHILEAN-U.S. RELATIONS HAVE THINGS BEEN SO
LOW AS DURING THE PAST 16 YEARS.

   ONLY IN LIGHT OF THIS BACKGROUND DATA CAN THE IMPORTANCE OF GEORGE
BUSH'S VISIT BE EVALUATED.  ALL THIS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA
WITH THE RE-INSTATEMENT OF OUR NATION IN THE PLACE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS
HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED, THE RECOVERY OF OUR INFLUENCE, AND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE COMMITMENTS.

   BUSH'S VISIT IS THE MOST VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION THAT "THE WARS" HAVE
ENDED AND THAT INTERNATIONAL POLICIES ARE TODAY BUILT ON THE BASIS OF
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

ORGANIZATION HEADED BY FATHER JEAN BERTRAND ARISTIDE] IS GOING TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS BEING HELD
23-30 APRIL IN BUENOS AIRES, CAPITAL OF ARGENTINA. THE REVEREND FATHER JEAN
BERTRAND ARISTIDE, WHO LEADS THIS LITTLE SOCIETY, WILL LEAVE HAITI ON 20
APRIL.  HE WILL BE HEADING THE HAITIAN DELEGATION TO THIS CONFERENCE.

   FATHER ARISTIDE SAID HE IS LEAVING WITH MUCH CHAGRIN IN HIS HEART
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THE UNDERCOVER DETECTIVES STILL ARMED BUT THE
JUDICIARY HAS AS YET TO SHOW THAT CHANGE IS BLOWING OVER THE COUNTRY.

   FATHER ARISTIDE POINTED THE FINGER AT MRS. ERTHA PASCAL TROUILLOT,
WHO MUST SHOULDER HER RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD, WHICH
THINKS THE HAITIAN ARMY IS UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE NATION'S PRESIDENT,
LIKE THE HEAD OF THE ARMY DECLARED ON 13 MARCH 1990. FATHER ARISTIDE
FEELS ONE CANNOT COUNT ON THE HAITIAN ARMY TO PROVIDE SECURITY DURING
THE ELECTIONS. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS THAT, EVEN THOUGH A PART OF THE
ARMY IS HONEST, THE TREND TODAY DICTATES ORGANIZED VIGILANCE BRIGADES
IN ADDITION TO THE HONEST PART OF THE ARMY, IF WE DO NOT WANT A REPEAT
OF 29 NOVEMBER 1987. FATHER ARISTIDE SAYS YES TO ELECTIONS BUT FIRST,
JUSTICE. IF NOT, THE OAS AND THE UNITED NATIONS CAN GO AHEAD AND COME
TO HAITI, BUT IT WILL BE LIKE WASHING ONE'S HANDS AND PATTING THEM ON
THE DUSTY GROUND TO DRY THEM.

   REGARDING THE WAY THE POPULATION IS PROVIDING ITS OWN JUSTICE BY
BURNING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, FATHER ARISTIDE SAID THAT THE
POPULATION ACTS THIS WAY BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES DO NOT DO
THEIR DUTY; AND THAT IF THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE DOES NOT DECIDE TO
HURRY UP, THEY [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] MIGHT AS WELL SHUT IT DOWN AND
RE-OPEN IT WITH BRAND NEW PEOPLE.

   REGARDING THE RUMORS CIRCULATING TO THE EFFECT THAT FATHER ARISTIDE
IS PLANNING TO RUN IN THE FUTURE ELECTIONS IN HAITI, FATHER ARISTIDE
DECLARED: ARISTIDE HAS NEVER BEEN POWER-MAD. NOR HAS HE EVER HANKERED
TO BE PRESIDENT. FATHER ARISTIDE SAID, FURTHER, AND WE QUOTE: I HAVE
CHOSEN TO REMAIN AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. I WILL DO WHAT THE MASSES
ASK ME TO DO, AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. [NO REFERENCE OF CLOSING OF
QUOTATION AS HEARD]

   LAST, FATHER ARISTIDE ASKED THE HONEST MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES
TO GO OVER AND STAND AT THE SIDE OF THE MASSES. BY SO DOING, THEY WILL
GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS PEOPLE WHO WORKED TO SET HAITI ON THE ROAD TO
DEMOCRACY.

   THUS, FATHER ARISTIDE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, TO
ANNOUNCE THAT HE WAS GOING ON A TRIP TO REPRESENT LA FANMI SE LA VI AT
THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STREET URCHINS THAT IS BEING HELD IN
ARGENTINA.

   BUENOS AIRES, 21 APR 90 (DYN) -- [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER HUMBERTO
ROMERO SAID TODAY THAT ARGENTINA HAS "SUSPENDED AND FROZEN" THE
"CONDOR" MISSILE PROJECT.  HE ALSO DENIED INTERNATIONAL PRESS REPORTS
THAT THE MISSILE WAS BEING BUILT IN SECRET WITH IRAQ FOR POTENTIAL USE
AGAINST ISRAEL.

   DURING A MEETING WITH REPORTERS THIS AFTERNOON, ROMERO SAID: "THE
PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL DECISION, AND ALSO
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS TECHNICAL PROJECT."

   THIS IS HOW THE MINISTER IMPLICITLY ALLUDED TO THE REPEATED PRESS
REPORTS FROM EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MIDDLE EAST ABOUT
ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE OF THE STAGES OF
THE IRAQI MISSILE SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION IRAQ, ISRAEL, OR THE
REPORT ON THE MISSILE, ROMERO SAID: "WE WANT TO PUT THIS TO REST IN
THE FACE OF PUBLICATIONS THAT APPEAR IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS EVERY
SO OFTEN."  HE ADDED: "WE ALWAYS SAID THE PROJECT NEVER REPRESENTED
ANY RISK OR DANGER FOR ANYONE, BUT AT ANY RATE THE PROJECT WAS
SUSPENDED, IT IS FROZEN."

   THIS WEEK IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN SAID HIS COUNTRY CAN WAGE
A TOTAL WAR AGAINST ISRAEL THROUGH THE USE OF MEDIUM-RANGE STRATEGIC
MISSILES THAT CAN REPORTEDLY CARRY CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  HUSSEIN ALSO
SAID ANY ISRAELI EFFORT TO BOMB THE IRAQI MISSILE MANAUFACTURING
PLANTS WOULD BE FUTILE BECAUSE "OUR MISSILES ARE MADE IN PARTS IN
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD."

   ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS THE
MANUFACTURER, IN COOPERATION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ, OF MEDIUM-RANGE --
ABOUT 800 KM -- BALLISTIC MISSILES.  EACH TIME ARGENTINA HAS
CATEGORICALLY DENIED THIS.  THE ARGENTINE AIR FORCE SUCCESSFULLY
DEVELOPED THE "CONDOR I" AND "CONDOR II" PROJECTS.  IT HAS BEEN
ASSURED THAT THESE ARE FOR PUTTING A DOMESTIC SATELLITE IN ORBIT.

   THE LAST MISSILE TEST WAS MADE JULY L989 AT THE CHAMICAL AIRSPACE
BASE, LA RIOJA PROVINCE, WHERE A STAGE OF THE "CONDOR" MISSILE
TRAVELLED MORE THAT 160 KM.

PURGE THE RANKS AND GET RID OF THOSE BAD MEMBERS, SO THAT THEY DO NOT
CONTINUE TO HARM THE REMAINING MEMBERS.

   2.  THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PURGE IS SIMPLY THE

DOES NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE.

THE JESUITS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- CARRYING OUT ORDERS.  I
HAVE ONLY SAID IN PUBLIC WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND
EXPRESSING IN A LOW VOICE.

   4.  THEREFORE, A NATIONAL COMMENTARY DOES NOT ENDANGER THE COUNTRY
OR THE ARMED FORCES.  THOSE WHO DECIDED TO ADOPT A DECISION, WHOSE
SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE ASSESSED, ARE THE ONES WHO
ENDANGERED THE U.S. MILITARY AID AND -- IN THE PROCESS -- WITTINGLY OR
UNWITTINGLY PLAYED INTO THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HANDS.

   5.  WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE AND THAT IT
IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WHICH, FOR ONE REASON OR
ANOTHER, HAVE FAILED TO TURN IT OVER TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS.

   6.  JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND A VAST MAJORITY OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECTED, A FULL INVESTIGATION AND SOLUTION OF
THIS CRIME WHICH SHOOK THE WORLD, ALL GOOD SALVADORANS TRUST THAT
JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED THE LAW WILL ANSWER
FOR THE CRIME THEY HAVE PERPETRATED.

LEONGOMEZ'S DEATH WAS A RESULT OF A COIN TOSS OVER CESAR GAVIRIA,
RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, CARLOS PIZARRO, AND ALVARO GOMEZ.  TODAY'S

ATTACKS WILL CONTINUE AS LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GIVE THEM

SET ASIDE THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST EXTRADITION.  THEY ARE NOW DEMANDING
POLITICAL - MILITARY TREATMENT AND HAVE THREATENED TO CONTINUE WITH

AN IRANIAN-MADE Z-5 K, WHICH ACCORDING TO ZAPATOCA WILL BE USED FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN BOGOTA WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPOKESMAN] THE CNPS REGRETS TO INFORM
THE PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ WAS
ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THIS MORNING, AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.  THESE SHOTS
CAUSED VERY SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL AND CEREBRAL WOUNDS AS WELL AS GRAVE
WOUNDS TO THE FACE AND NECK.

   DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A TEAM OF DOCTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL
SURGEONS, NEUROSURGEONS, ANESTHESISTS, OPHTHALMOLOGISTS, DOCTORS FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CNPS, IT WAS
NOT POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND HE DIED [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] [END RECORDING]

   ...GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION WITH THE M-19 LEADERS WHO WERE THERE AT
THE TIME SHOUTING SLOGANS.  THEY DID NOT ALLOW THE CNPS SPOKESMAN TO
FINISH READING THE COMMUNIQUE.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE AGAIN CORDONED OFF THE AREA.  THE M-19 MEMBERS
ARE PROTESTING THE MURDER OF PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE F-2,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTAMENT OF SECURITY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR AT LEAST TWO COLLABORATORS OF THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO MURDERED M-19
LEADER PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AT LEAST TWO MEN COLLABORATED
WITH THE MURDERER INSIDE THE HK-1400 PLANE THAT WAS FLYING BETWEEN
BOGOTA AND BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
MACHINEGUN USED BY THE PAID ASSASSIN, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALVARO
RODRIGUEZ, WAS HIDDEN IN THE BATHROOM.  NOW THE AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING
TO ESTABLISH IF THE WEAPON WAS PLACED THERE AT THE BUCARAMANGA
AIRPORT, WHERE THE PLANE HAD BEEN FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS, OR IF IT WAS
PLACED THERE IN BOGOTA.

   THE POLICE HAD SEARCHED THE PAID ASSASSIN TWICE BEFORE THE INCIDENT
BUT DID NOT FIND ANY WEAPONS.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A
TOTAL OFFENSIVE TO CAPTURE MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
FOLLOWING THE DEATH YESTERDAY OF NINE PEOPLE IN AN ATTACK BY THE
EXTRADITABLES IN MEDELLIN.

   THE OFFENSIVE WAS ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF AN URGENT MEETING OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL CALLED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE,
WHO IS ACTING PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S TRIP TO
NICARAGUA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT VIOLETA CHAMORRO.

   SERPA SAID THAT ESCOBAR HAS BECOME ENEMY NO. ONE AND NOTED THAT ALL
OF THE AUTHORITIES' EFFORTS ARE NOW CENTERED ON HIS CAPTURE. THE
MINISTER SAID THAT ESCOBAR IS BEHIND THE VIOLENCE ONSLAUGHT AND ASKED
THE POPULATION TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES' EFFORTS TO CAPTURE
HIM. "PABLO ESCOBAR IS BEHIND THE VIOLENCE ONSLAUGHT," THE GOVERNMENT
MINISTER SAID.

   NINE PEOPLE DIED AND APPROXIMATELY 50 WERE WOUNDED WHEN A CAR
LOADED WITH 200 KG OF DYNAMITE EXPLODED IN A HEAVILY POPULATED
DISTRICT IN MEDELLIN KNOWN AS LAS AMERICAS. POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT
THE CAR BOMB, WHICH WAS CAMOUFLAGED WITH CONSTRUCTION WASTE, WAS SET
OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AT A PASSING ELITE POLICE PATROL.

   THE EXPLOSION SERIOUSLY DAMAGED OVER 10 PRIVATE VEHICLES AND AT
LEAST THREE BUSES WITH PASSENGERS AS WELL AS A DOZEN BUSINESS
ESTABLISHMENTS AND PRIVATE RESIDENCES.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL OSCAR BOTERO RESTREPO SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS
THE WORK OF THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED WING OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, ONE OF
THE BIGGEST DRUG PROCESSING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD.
MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, IS THE HOME OF THE CARTEL AND OF
ITS ARMED WING--THE EXTRADITABLES--WHICH DESCRIBED THEMSELVES IN MARCH AS A
POLITICAL-MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND DECLARED WAR ON THE COLOMBIAN STATE.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ANNOUNCED AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE RELEGATING
THEIR STRUGGLE TO PREVENT THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS TO THE UNITED
STATES TO SECOND PLACE AND THAT THEIR TOP PRIORITY WOULD BE TO FIGHT
THE STATE, THE OLIGARCHY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE WHO KIDNAP,
TORTURE AND MURDER THE MEMBERS OF THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR
FAMILIES.

   YESTERDAY'S ATTACK WAS THE SECOND TO BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST
COLOMBIA'S SPECIAL ANTIDRUG AND COUNTERINSURGENCY ELITE POLICE CORPS.
ON 11 MARCH ANOTHER CAR BOMB LOADED WITH OVER 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS
EXPLODED AGAINST A POLICE VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY SOUTH OF MEDELLIN.
EIGHT POLICEMEN AND NINE CIVILIANS WERE KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT MINISTER
HORACIO SERPA URIBE, WHO HAS JUST LEFT THE NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE
INSTITUTE, HAS DENOUNCED CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ' ASSASSINATION.  HE ADDED
THAT NO THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF
THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE LEFT IN VIOLENT
HANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER COMMENTED FURTHER ON THE TOP M-19 [19 APRIL
MOVEMENT] LEADER'S ASSASSINATION:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SERPA] THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH SAD AND CRIMINAL
DEVELOPMENTS IS TRULY A DISGRACE.  IT HAS SADDENED EVERYBODY VERY
MUCH.  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT ONLY AN ATTACK AGAINST FORMER
CANDIDATE PIZARRO BUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY, AND
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  I FEEL THAT WE MUST RESPOND TO AGGRESSIVENESS
AND CRIME WITH FEELINGS OF CONCILIATION AND PEACE.

   [REPORTER] HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS
AFTER THIS ASSASSINATION, BEARING IN MIND THAT PIZARRO WAS ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES?

   [SEPRPA] HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES.
THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY
REGARDS THE PEACEMKING PROCESS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT WITH THE M-19,
IN WHICH PIZARRO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KEY PLAYER.  WE HAVE ADOPTED SOME
DECISIONS IN THIS REGARD.  I AM GOING TO MEET WITH THE HEAD OF STATE
AND ALL OF US WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SAD DEVELOPMENTS WHICH
COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING WITH A DESIRE TO MEET THE NEED FOR
TRANQUILLITY AND COEXISTENCE WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HAD
THUS FAR.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT TWO PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN LESS THAN 40 DAYS REPRESENT TO
THE GOVERNMENT?  HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK BEFORE THE NATION AND
THE WORLD?

   [SERPA] WELL, I REPEAT, THIS IS A VERY SAD CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS IS
EXTREMELY WORRISOME, OF COURSE.  LIKE ALL COLOMBIANS, WE ARE TROUBLED
OVER THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH CRIME AND
BLOODSHED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT ALL
CITIZENS AND TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
COLOMBIANS' LIVES.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE DELUDED MINDS AND THERE ARE
CRIMINALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DAMAGING THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS AN
ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA, AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

   [REPORTER] MR. MINISTER, HAVE YOU AT ANY TIME THOUGHT OF ADOPTING
SPECIAL MEASURES?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN
COLOMBIA AT THIS TIME?  WHAT REPORTS DO YOU HAVE?

   [SERPA] NO, THERE IS CALM IN GENERAL. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY
WORRIED, OF COURSE.  WE ARE GOING TO MEET NOW TO DISCUSS THIS TERRIBLE
CASE.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
GO ON CAMPAIGNING IN PUBLIC AT THIS MOMENT?

   [SERPA] I WOULD NOT DARE MAKE ANY ASSERTION IN THIS REGARD. WHAT I
FEEL IS THAT WE MUST NOT YIELD A SINGLE CENTIMETER TO THE VIOLENT
PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINALS.  [END RECORDING]

   SERPA MADE THESE STATEMENTS A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE LEFT THE
NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS BEING PERFORMED
AT THIS MOMENT ON PIZARRO'S BODY.

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS IS THE
GOVERNMENT'S CLARIFICATION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE GOVERNMENT'S STAND.

   [MODERATOR] DAVID RIVAS OF AFP.

   [RIVAS] MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR REPLIES TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS HAVE
ALREADY ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING, HOWEVER.  NOW THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS ABOUT TO START,
THE TWO SIDES HAVE APPARENTLY HARDENED THEIR POSITIONS.  THE FMLN
COMMANDERS HAVE SAID THAT, TO END THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THERE MUST
BE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF INJUSTICE AND LACK OF DEMOCRACY.  THE
MINISTER OF JUSTICE, IN TURN, SAID RECENTLY THAT THE FMLN MUST RETURN
TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO NEGOTIATE.  I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT WILL BE NEGOTIATED AND WHAT WILL BE DONE TO END THE WAR
THROUGH A DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN.

   [CRISTIANI] I AM SURPRISED BY THE REMARKS THAT YOU ARE ATTRIBUTING
TO DR. SANTAMARIA, BECAUSE HE IS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED SO FAR.  HE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THERE IS POINT TWO OF THE
GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH NOTES THAT POLITICAL AGREEMENTS MUST BE
REACHED IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO ARMED CONFRONTATION AND THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE WILL
BE A PROCESS FOR DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, REFERRED TO AS THE
TOTAL SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE AGREEMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT IT
IS A MATTER OF REACHING AGREEMENTS.  WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE INVOLVED
IN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE
IN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY KILLED, SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, AND SO MANY
PROBLEMS.

   AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS
BARRING THEIR RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE?  THEY ARE THE ONLY GROUP
THAT HAS NOT JOINED THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WHAT DO THEY
WANT?  LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING REASONABLE THAT CAN BE DONE.
THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER ALL THAT
COULD FOSTER OR CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE
BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS. I CANNOT SEE ANY HARDENING BY
THE GOVERNMENT.  I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN FLEXIBLE.  WE HAVE SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING AS ITS OWN ANY CONSENSUS
REACHED BY THE PARTIES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT LEAST YOUR REMARK ON THE
GOVERNMENT IS NOT TRUE.  I REPEAT, PERHAPS IN THE STYLE OF THE
PREVIOUS QUESTION, THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO BE BIASED.  IN DUE TIME, WE
WILL SEE WHETHER THE FMLN HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN INFLEXIBLE OR HARDENED
OR WHATEVER.  IT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE FMLN'S PROPOSALS ARE
REASONABLE OR NOT.

   [MODERATOR] PABLO YACU OF [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [YACU] MR. PRESIDENT, CONCERNING THE ECONOMY, SOME OF THE
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS I TALKED WITH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE TOLD
ME THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED.  THEY THINK THAT, BECAUSE
DIFFICULTIES HAVE ARISEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW SITUATION IN THE
COUNTRY, AND BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF THE U.S. AID HAS DIMINISHED, THE
COUNTRY IS RAPIDLY TAKING STEPS THAT OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN, TO MEET WITH THE SO-CALLED CONSULTING GROUP FORMED
BY THE LEADING WORLD CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND REQUEST LARGE LOANS TO
STABILIZE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THESE POLITICIANS TOLD ME THAT
THEY ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD IMPOSE A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD ASSUME OFFICE AFTER 1994.

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS SHOULD TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE MEASURES, WHICH CERTAINLY ENTAIL A
SACRIFICE FOR THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS, ARE RESPONSIBLY TAKEN
BECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  MANY PEOPLE
WILL SAY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THIS OR THAT.  I WOULD ONLY LOOK AT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT THE
DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE CAUSED BY AN IRREGULAR FORCE, SUCH AS THE
FMLN, HAVE EXPERIENCED MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN THOSE
ENCOUNTERED BY EL SALVADOR AT PRESENT.  WE WOULD ALSO ENCOUNTER THOSE
PROBLEMS IF WE FAIL TO TAKE MEASURES.  NEARBY IS NICARAGUA, THE
INFLATION RATE OF WHICH HAS REACHED 1,700 PERCENT, ITS FOREIGN DEBT IS
ENORMOUS, AND IT IS IMMERSED IN DRAMATIC PROBLEMS.  NO MEASURES WERE
TAKEN IN DUE TIME IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA, ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES
WERE PAINFUL.  IF THEY ARE NOT TAKEN ON TIME, THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE
PAINFUL LATER, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE TO
CHECK THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE
TRYING TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY TO START ITS EFFECTIVE RECOVERY.  IT
IS BASED ON THIS RECOVERY THAT WE WILL AVOID FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS,
WHICH FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN AN EASY WAY OUT AND AN
ALTERNATIVE, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY CONCERNING
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1239 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] YES, I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TELL THIS TO THE
JUDGE AT THE 4TH PENAL COURT.  FRANKLY, AS I SAID, THIS CASE IS NOW IN
THE HANDS OF THE COURT.  THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO CAN ORDER FUTURE
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CASE.  YOUR QUESTIONS RELATE TO DOUBTS AND
CONCERNS THAT THE JUDGE HAS BEFORE HIM.  HE CAN SUMMON ANYONE TO
TESTIFY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ALREADY SUMMONED SOME TOP OFFICERS.

   I CAN ONLY SAY THIS: YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MEETING IN WHICH
SUPPOSEDLY I WAS PRESENT.  YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS AT THAT MEETING
THAT THE MURDER WAS PLANNED.  THERE IS MUCH SPECULATION, THEREFORE I
THINK THAT WE MUST REMAIN COOL-HEADED.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE
SPECULATING WHEN THEY SAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, THIS COULD HAVE
HAPPENED, OR THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME HAVE
SAID THAT THERE IS A COVER UP, BUT COLONEL RIVAS HIMSELF WAS THE ONE
WHO DISCOVERED WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.

   THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, WHICH IS NATURAL.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT
MEAN THAT ...[CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR EXAMPLE, I MADE A STATEMENT FOR THE
PROGRAM "60 MINUTES;" I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT
OBVIOUSLY MY REPLIES WERE NOT AIRED FOR SOME REASON.  HOWEVER, I SAID
THAT IT IS NO SECRET IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE,
A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHO FEEL THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SOME OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE IN FACT LINKED TO THE FMLN.  THEREFORE, IN
THIS CASE, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE
TO BE INVESTIGATED.  WOULD THAT BE CALLED FOR?  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON SPECULATION.

   FURTHERMORE, DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CONDUCTED BY THE
INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS, AN AUXILIARY LEGAL ORGAN
-- WE THOUGHT IT WAS CONVENIENT AT A GIVEN TIME, SINCE WE HAD ENOUGH
EVIDENCE ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE BELIEVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT THE
CASE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.

   THEREFORE, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TODAY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE AND DECIDES WHETHER TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE OR NOT.  IF THERE IS
ANY DOUBT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN ORDER THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE
THIS OR THAT.  WHETHER SOMEONE IS INTERROGATED BY A JUDGE OR BY THE
COMMISSION IS IRRELEVANT; THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT IN
THIS CASE THE JUDGE SHOULD INVESTIGATE.  AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK
THAT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HONOR COMMISSION
WILL BE SUMMONED, AND THAT ANOTHER MAY BE SUMMONED AFTERWARD.

   [REPORTER] COULD YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DO NOT THINK
THAT IT IS NECESSARY, THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE JESUITS, AND IF
YOU ARE GOING TO START INVESTIGATING PEOPLE, WHY NOT INVESTIGATE EVERYONE
WHO HAS CRITICIZED THE JESUITS.  THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT NOT
EVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION TO REPROVE THE JESUITS, NOT EVERYONE WAS IN THE
MILITARY HIERARCHY, NOT EVERYONE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALTO MANDO [PRECEDING
WORDS IN SPANISH].  THERE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] PEOPLE IN THE ALTO MANDO WHO
ARE KNOWN TO HATE THE JESUITS, WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CRITICIZED THEM IN THE
PAST.  WHY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO BE
INVESTIGATED DIRECTLY?

   [CRISTIANI] FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS
IN THE ARMED FORCES AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, WHETHER LATELY OR EARLIER, THAT
THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF OF SOME SORT OF PARTICIPATION BY THE
...[CORRECTS HIMSELF] SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WITH THE FMLN.  THIS IS NOT
FOR US AT THIS POINT AND TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  IT IS
SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WAS BELIEVED OUT THERE, AND THEREFORE, IT IS UP TO THE
JUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ONLY INTERVIEW ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED THIS,
OR WHETHER HE IS GOING TO INTERVIEW MANY PEOPLE.

   THERE HAS BEEN ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WELL COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACT
OF THE FMLN, THE ACT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS.  THERE WERE ALSO
SPECULATIONS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSASSINATION WAS COMMITTED AS
TO WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME.  SO THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE, THERE COULD BE OTHERS
THAT WE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE [WORD INDISTINCT] INVESTIGATING.  BUT,
I THINK IT IS ALL UP TO THE JUDGE NOW [TO DECIDE] WHO WILL HE CALL TO
TESTIFY, WHO WILL HE CALL TO INTERROGATE, AND IF HE FINDS ANY NEED, HE
HAS ALL THE POWER TO INSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT TO FOLLOW THROUGH
ON ANYTHING THAT HE REACHES.  IT IS NOT UP TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH RIGHT
NOW TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO COME UP WITH TESTIMONY WITH THE JUDGE.
IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] ROLANDO GONZALEZ, LOS ANGELES TIMES.

   [GONZALEZ] MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE A QUESTION THAT WAS MADE IN
SPANISH BEFORE AND IT'S RELATED ABOUT COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ.  HE HAS BEEN A
HARD-LINE MILITARY AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT HIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] GOT TO BE
POSSIBLE?  THIS IS ONE AND I GOT A SECOND ONE.  CAN YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE RELATION WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RECENT MACHINEGUN TRAFFIC OF THE GUERRILLAS?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WITH THE FIRST CASE MY OPINION IS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS
ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS
SHOULD -- INSTEAD OF SPECULATE WITH IT PUBLICLY -- SHOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE
COURT THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE AND GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
TO HIM OR THAT HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF, AND THEN HAVE THE JUDGE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

   I THINK THAT MERE SPECULATION IN PUBLIC IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
GOOD FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR IT.
SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER, IN CASES LIKE
THIS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE OPINION OF A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF THE
ARMED FORCES IS ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE OR TOTALLY FALSE [SENTENCE
AS HEARD].  YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT
HIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE.

   IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY
WOULD BELIEVE COL. OCHOA, ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE HIM
ALL THE CREDIBILITY IN THIS CASE.  I AM NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE SAID
IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED
PUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY,
OR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE
DECIDED TO INITIATE [32-SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] PLANS AND,
THEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS.  HER ADVISER WAS
VERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT
RESPECT.

   WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY
AND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET
ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA....[CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUT OF NICARAGUA
BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD FACE WITH THE NEW
GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER GO ABOUT FREELY IN NICARAGUA
WITH THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC SUPPORT.  THEREFORE, THEY HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO BRING THEM IN.  IN THAT CASE THERE WAS A GROUP OF FMLN
MEMBERS WHO WERE DETAINED IN HONDURAS WITH THE HELP OF THE HONDURAN
AUTHORITIES, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHIPPING WEAPONS BY
LAND THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY, BUT THAT GROUP WAS DETAINED.

   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT; THANK YOU, MR.
FOREIGN MINISTER.  JOURNALISTS, THANK YOU.

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING.  WE
COLOMBIANS HAD NOT GOTTEN OVER YESTERDAY'S CRUEL ATTACK IN MEDELLIN
WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH ANOTHER DISGRACE THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.  IN A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT VOICED ITS DEEP ANGER AND
SADNESS OVER THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK AND IT RATIFIED ITS DETERMINATION TO
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT DISMAY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF CRIMES AND
THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE SO INFAMOUSLY ATTACKING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   THIS IS NO TIME TO ABANDON ANY ATTITUDE THAT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE
FOR THE NATION.  IN THE FACE OF THE FRATRICIDAL AND ANTI-PATRIOTIC
VIOLENCE, WE MUST ANSWER WITH ACTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING AND
CONCILIATION, WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL DISMANTLE THE BANDS OF
CRIMINALS WHO ARE DOING SUCH SERIOUS HARM TO THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE
DETERMINATION THAT WILL RENEW FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND IN
THE PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST LEVELS OF COEXISTENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT
IS DETERMINED TO DO THAT.

   HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH ALL COLOMBIANS OF GOODWILL.
FROM EACH OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, WE DEMAND POSITIVE ACTIONS AND A
GREAT SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS' SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION.  THE PEACE,
UNDERSTANDING, AND CONCILIATION TO WHICH CARLOS PIZARRO WAS COMMITTED
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF ITS
CITIZENS.

   ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL LEAD TO CLARIFYING THAT
TREACHEROUS CRIME ARE BEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND
THEN PUNISH THEM.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WILL BE
VERY SEVERE, AND THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY BEING
PROVIDED VERY AMPLE COOPERATION.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M-19] LEADERS, AND IT HAS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO ITS DEMANDS,
CHARGES, AND CONCERNS.  THERE IS A MARKED INTEREST BECAUSE THERE
CONTINUES TO BE DIRECT RELATIONS WITH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, THE
VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY
AND INDISPENSABLE GUARANTEES SO THAT WE WILL HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 27
MAY, AS THE PEOPLE WANT.

   NATIONAL COEXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIZENS' DEMANDS FOR
REFORMS, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BASIC GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT OF DR.
VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO WILL TOMORROW ADDRESS THE COLOMBIANS.  M-19 HAS
ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE PUBLIC ITS FEELINGS AND
OPINIONS IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT TRAGEDY.

   THROUGH ME, AND ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 42 OF 1985, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED THIS AIR TIME SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
SPOKESMAN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS
BRUTALLY MURDERED TODAY, WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS HIS IDEAS.

   THOSE WHO SEEK TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS A POLITICAL
PARTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE IT MAY BE -- WILL NOT ACHIEVE IT,
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT ITS VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE HEARD.  DESPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL WIN.

TODAY ASKED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TO BE ADMITTED TO THE
NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING WITH DIVERSE POLITICAL
GROUPS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

   THE UP NATIONAL DIRECTORATE MET TODAY WITH BARCO AND GAVE HIM A
LETTER NOTING THAT THE EXCLUSION OF SOCIAL FORCES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
MAY AGAIN BE A MOCKERY OF THE PEOPLE.  IT AGAIN ASKED FOR PROTECTION
FOR THE LIVES OF ITS MILITANTS.

   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1985, MORE THAN 1,000 UP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN
KILLED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

   THE UP EXPLAINS IN ITS LETTER THAT THE ASSASSINATION ON 22 MARCH OF
BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORCED IT TO WITHDRAW
FROM THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS.  THIS DID NOT DETER IT, HOWEVER, FROM ITS
STRUGGLE FOR A PLEBISCITE AND FROM CALLING FOR A NATIONAL, POPULAR AND
DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   THE UP ADDED THAT A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL
POPULAR SECTORS, WILL BE CHARGED WITH DRAFTING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.
THE REFORMS MUST THEN BE SUBMITTED TO A PLEBISCITE.

   A WEEK AGO, THE LIBERAL PARTY, SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY, 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT (M-19), AND NATIONAL SALVATION MOVEMENT MET TO TRY TO REACH
AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT HOLDING A NATIONAL PLEBISCITE ON 27 MAY
TO APPROVE SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS TO THE STATE.

   GOVERNMENT MINISTER HORACIO SERPA URIBE STATED THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SEEK TO IMPOSE ITS CRITERIA ON THE
WILL TO EFFECT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION IS VERY CLEAR AND SEEKS TO RESPOND TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.

   ALSO, THE UP CONVENED POLITICAL PARTIES, SOCIAL FORCES, STUDENTS,
AND COLOMBIANS IN GENERAL WHO WERE EXCLUDED FROM THESE NEGOTIATIONS,
TO UNITE A PROPOSAL ON THE 27 MAY PLEBISCITE.

   FINALLY, THE UP DIRECTORATE ASKED, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY, TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE REBEL FORCES.

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [STATEMENT]
[LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO] [TEXT]
COLOMBIANS, DURING THESE MONTHS OF NATIONAL TRAGEDY WE HAVE BEEN HIT
BY EVENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  VIOLENCE STRIKES THE HEARTS OF OUR
INSTITUTIONS, VALUES, DEMOCRACY, AND OUR BEST MEN.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL
OF THOSE ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE IS TO PREVENT DEMOCRACY FROM FUNCTIONING.
THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE UNLEASHED THEIR EVIL AGAINST OPTIONS FOR CHANGES
THAT COULD STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY AND PREVENT VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA.
BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED, ONE BY ONE.  THEIR EXISTENCE WAS
A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL OF VIOLENT PRACTICES.  IT IS NOT A
COINCIDENCE THAT DURING THE CURRENT ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THREE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE
EITHER THAT OTHER BRAVE MINDS THAT ADVOCATED REFORM HAD BEEN KILLED
BEFORE IN THAT STRUGGLE.

   RODRIGO LARA, WHO WAS MURDERED SIX YEARS ON 23 APRIL, WAS THE FIRST
TO DENOUNCE THE GRAVE EFFECTS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ON THE STABILITY OF
OUR INSTITUTIONS.  THOSE WHO KILLED HIM WANTED TO OPEN PATHS FOR THE
SO-CALLED CRIME TOLERANCE.

   GUILLERMO CANO, A BRAVE NEWSMAN, REPRESENTED A FREE, CRITICAL
PRESS, SUCH AS IS NEEDED IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY.  HIS KILLERS THOUGHT
THAT BY DROWNING OUT HIS VOICE THEY WOULD INTIMIDATE THE DEFENDERS OF
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

   LUIS CARLOS GALAN WAS KILLED EIGHT MONTHS AGO.  BY KILLING HIM,
THEY SOUGHT TO ASSASSINATE A HOPE OF RENOVATION AND CHANGE AND A DEEP
CONVICTION FOR THE NEED TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM POLITICAL HABITS AND
THE CLIMATE OF CORRUPTION, IMMORALITY, AND INDIFFERENCE IN THE FACE OF
CRIME.  THIS INDIFFERENCE LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE GREAT EVILS THAT
ARE CAUSING BLOODSHED IN THE COUNTRY.

   BERNARDO JARAMILLO STRUGGLED FOR A PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC LEFT THAT
REJECTED ARMED STRUGGLE AND THAT WANTED TO BUILD A MORE JUST SOCIETY.
BY KILLING HIM, THE CRIMINALS SOUGHT TO BLOCK THE PATHS TO LEGITIMATE
PROTEST WITHIN THE LAW.

   CARLOS PIZARRO, THE LAST LINK IN THIS MACABRE CHAIN THAT INCLUDES
SO MANY OTHERS, REPRESENTED THE POSSIBILITY FOR GUERRILLA GROUPS TO
LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN INSTITUTIONAL POLITICS, OR FOR WEAPONS
TO BE REPLACED BY LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO STRUGGLE FOR LEGITIMATE IDEALS.
BY KILLING HIM IN A DASTARDLY AND COWARDLY MANNER YESTERDAY, THEY
SOUGHT TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND REINCORPORATION OF
ARMED GROUPS INTO CIVIL LIFE.

   THE DEATH OF OUR COUNTRYMEN SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN.  IT STRIKES DEEP
IN OUR HEARTS.  IT AFFECTS THE SPIRIT PROFOUNDLY.  IT MUST, THEREFORE,
AWAKEN THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE THOSE CRIMES ARE NOT MERELY
VILE CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED GREAT MEN WHO BELIEVED IN THE STRENGTH OF
IDEALS.  THESE HAVE BEEN CRIMES AGAINST OUR BASIC VALUES, AGAINST THE
CLEAN IDEALS OF PROGRESS AND PEACE THAT THESE MEN REPRESENTED.  WE
MUST NOT BE MISTAKEN.  THOSE WHO KILLED OUR LEADERS DID NOT EXTINGUISH
THE NOBLE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES.  THEIR VALUES WILL
PREVAIL.  THEY ARE OUR VALUES.  THEIR HOPES STILL LIVE.  THOSE HOPES
BELONG TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  THEIR DREAM WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.  IT IS
THE DREAM WE ALL HAVE OF ATTAINING PEACE AND PROSPERITY.  THAT IS WHY
I PRAISE WHAT ANTONIO NAVARRO SAID LAST NIGHT: "I INVITE THE M-19 [19
APRIL MOVEMENT] TO CONTINUE WALKING ALONG THE PATH THAT PIZARRO
CHARTED.  TERRORISM'S GOAL HAS BEEN TO CLOSE THE PATHS TO CHANGE,
RENOVATION, AND REFORM.

   OUR PATH, ON THE CONTRARY, IS TO MAKE PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC
REVOLUTION VIABLE.  IT IS A REVOLUTION OF HOPE.  THIS DEEP CRISIS WILL
NOT BE SOLVED BY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE
INSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY, BUT BY UNITING EFFORTS OF ALL GOOD
COLOMBIANS TO REPAIR THE ROADS TO CHANGE, RENOVATION, AND REFORM.

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] I AM HAPPY
THAT NAVARRO, OVER THE TELEVISION, CALLED FOR COMMON SENSE AND FOR
PIZARRO'S FUNERAL TO BE CONDUCTED IN PEACE TOMORROW.  IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
SO THAT THE M-19 AND THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CARRY ON THEIR
CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE FULLY SUPPORTED THE
ARMY, THE POLICE, THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY], AND
ALL OF THE AUTHORITIES CHARGED WITH MAINTAINING ORDER.  THESE AGENCIES
ARE AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO
CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFICIENTLY.

   AT THIS TIME, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVERLOOK THE RESULTS ACHIEVED
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIOLENT ONES AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
ACHIEVED.  I UNDERSTAND THE IMPATIENCE AND THE DESIRE FOR DEFINITIVE
RESULTS AGAINST NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT ALL OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF
VIOLENCE AS WELL.

   I WILL NOW MENTION SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT COMPLEMENT THOSE THAT
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF
A HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION, IN WHICH THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE
REPRESENTED, TO FOLLOW UP THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO ASSESS THE
SECURITY MEASURES THAT THE PUBLIC FORCE AND THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR ALL CANDIDATES.  THIS COMMISSION CAN BY ITSELF
PROPOSE NEW MEASURES TO REINFORCE THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES IN VARIOUS
AREAS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY WILL MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL
CAMPAIGNS TO CONSIDER THE EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES.  THE
COMMISSION MET WITH THE M-19 AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY AND WILL
MEET WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE
PROTECTION FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO
WORK TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EACH OF THE CANDIDATES TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL.
FOR THIS REASON, THE GOVERMENT WILL REVISE THE EXISTING SITUATION
REGARDING MOBILIZATION AND LOCATION OF THE CANDIDATES.  ALSO, THE
GOVERNMENT WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ELITE POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TERRORISM AND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE 1ST ARMY DIVISION
COMMANDER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE SPECIFIC TASK OF COORDINATING ALL
FORCES, SECURITY AGENCIES, AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE MEDELLIN
AREA.

   THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED A BROAD,
PARTICIPATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS.  TWO YEARS AGO, THE
GOVERNMENT PROPOSED A PLEBISCITE AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BILL.  IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT
INTERPRETED THE NATIONAL FEELING, WHICH DEMANDS A MORE EFFICIENT
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND EVEN MORE STRINGENT ANTITERRORIST
MEASURES, FOR WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  THE
GOVERNMENT ALSO ECHOED THE PEOPLE'S CALL FOR STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND
A MORE EFFICIENT AND REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS.  COLOMBIANS KNOW THAT
THE CURRENT EVILS WILL BE DEFINITIVELY OVERCOME BY EXPANDING AND
STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY EVEN FURTHER, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THE CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS THAT CONCERN THEM MOST.

   I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO
EVEYTHING NECESSARY SO THAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WE CAN PAVE THE WAY
FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: THE
MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO SOUGHT BOTH TO DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M- 19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] HAD CAREFULLY BUILT,
SURPASSING NUMEROUS OBSTACLES.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND
MAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, THOSE
WHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT
IS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE
HAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES.

   TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES.  THE
FIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND
AFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS
NARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF
THE EXTREME RIGHT.

   THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF
TOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM.  EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY
TIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD
WAR IS OVER.  A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE,
REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.  THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN
IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A
PLURALIST DEMOCRACY.

   THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO
WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A
CLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE.  THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE
AHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF
PEACE OPEN.

   ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE
SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO,
BECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE
PEACE.  FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION
TO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE,
AND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY.

   WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE
STRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS.  THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY
ARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP.  M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH
ALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE
TOLERATED.  THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE
M-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS
AND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST
THE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.

   THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER
ARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE
ELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO
THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS
OPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.  [CONTINUED]

   BOGOTA, 27 APR 90 [INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] WHEN THE
CONVERGENCE OF OPINIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CREATION OF
A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS MADE PUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE
TOWARD THE COUNTING OF THE RELEVANT BALLOT PAPERS.

   THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE THE RISK FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES.  DESPITE THE STRICT
SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY CARLOS PIZARRO, THE SUICIDAL CALLING OF A
HIRED ASSASSIN AT THE SERVICE OF EVIL INTERESTS ENDED HIS LIFE.

   IN VIEW OF THESE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL METHODS, LARGE NUMBERS OF
BODYGUARDS, BULLETPROOF VESTS, AND PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES COULD
HELP, BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH.

   IT IS NECESSARY FOR AUTHORITIES AND CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS TO TAKE
MAXIMUM PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.  THERE MUST BE MORE MODERN AND DIRECT
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE.

   I ADMIRE THE COURAGE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GONE TO PUBLIC
SQUARES, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY AND THE
STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS DEPENDS ON THE LIVES OF THE CANDIDATES.

   SO THIS CAMPAIGN CAN TAKE PLACE UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS
WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CANDIDATES TO RUN THE RISKS INVOLVED IN
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PROSELYTISM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO
INCREASE TELEVISION TIME FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF THE
PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CHANNELS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE FREE USE OF RADIO
STATIONS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ADVERTISEMENTS.  WE ARE TRYING FOR A MORE MODERN CAMPAIGN IN WHICH NEW
TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRAMS OF THE CANDIDATES SO
THAT THEY CAN DIRECTLY MAKE CONTACT WITH CITIZENS AND THEIR FAMILIES
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

   BESIDES, THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTENSIFY ITS CIVIC CAMPAIGN BY
INVITING ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.  THEIR VOTE FOR
ANY OF THE CANDIDATES OR EVEN A BLANK VOTE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE
PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF VIOLENCE.  IT IS A WAY OF RESOLVING CONFLICTS BY
PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MEANS.

   TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS IS TO VOTE FOR PEACE,
FOR DEMOCRACY AND TOLERANCE.  AMID THE SITUATION IN WHICH THIS COUNTRY
IS LIVING, VOTING IS AN OBLIGATION.  NO CITIZEN WITH A RIGHT TO VOTE
CAN AFFORD TO REMAIN AT HOME AND REMAIN INDIFFERENT.  [CONTINUED]

   TEGUCIGALPA, 23 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
CALLEJAS BY MODERATOR VALLADARES AND REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[CALLEJAS] WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THIS EVENING IS THAT WE MADE A CORRECT
DECISION.  THE ARMED FORCES' BUDGET WAS REDUCED BY 10 PERCENT; TO ASK
FOR A GREATER REDUCTION IS NOT TO KNOW OUR COUNTRY'S REALITY AND TO
DESTROY THE ARMED FORCES.  TO REDUCE THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' BUDGET
BY 50 PERCENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO DISMANTLING IT, AND I FOR ONE AM NOT
WILLING TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  I AGREED TO TAKE THE CORRECT PATH AT
THE RIGHT MOMENT; TO REDIRECT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO SEE
THEY ALSO ACT WITH AUSTERITY AND IN THE BEST NATIONAL INTEREST.

   IT IS EASY TO CRITICIZE AND SAY THINGS, BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THIS, NOTHING WAS DONE.  I HAVE ACTED.

   [VALLADARES] GERMAN REYES OF ACAN-EFE.

   [REYES] GOOD EVENING.  BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE I THINK WE SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO THE HOUSEWIVES FOR HAVING RUINED THEIR SOAP OPERA.
REGARDING THE GREEN BATTALIONS YOU MENTIONED, MR. PRESIDENT, WHICH ARE
GOING TO BE INSTALLED IN YAMALES -- WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE
THE CONTRAS ENTERED -- HOW ARE THE ONUCA [UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER
GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA] OFFICERS GOING TO VERIFY THAT THE CONTRA
WITHDRAWAL FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY?

   [CALLEJAS] THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  THE YAMALES CAMP IS INSIDE
HONDURAN TERRITORY.  THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW ONUCA AND CIAV
[INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION] FORCES TO
CONTROL THESE PERSONS.  ONCE MORE I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE
POSITION YOU ARE TAKING: WHY NOT SEE THINGS POSITIVELY?  INSTEAD OF
SAYING WE HAD CONTRAS HERE FOR 10 YEARS, SAY THAT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE
ANY.  I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF OPTIMISM WE SHOULD IMPRESS UPON THE
COUNTRY.  LET US NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT YESTERDAY, INSTEAD BUILD ON
TODAY'S REALITY.  I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY FELLOW CITIZENS AND YOU THAT NO LONGER ARE
WE TO HAVE CONTRAS IN HONDURAS -- A POSITIVE STEP.  IN THIS REGARD THE
GREEN BATTALIONS AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ACTION TO ADMINISTER
A TERRITORY THAT ONLY YESTERDAY WAS RELATIVELY OUT OF CONTROL OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

   [VALLADARES] [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THESE $247
MILLION -- IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE SUM -- WHICH TELLS OF THE SUCCESS OF
YOUR TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES.  THIS, HOWEVER, IS TO BE USED TO PAY
DEBTS.  DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNTS YOU MAY BE RECEIVING IN
THE FUTURE, OR IS IT A QUESTION OF HAVING TO WAIT THERE WITH A LITTLE
PAPER BAG TO THEN HAND IT OVER TO [CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT] DON RICARDO
MADURO?  WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE FORECASTS AND WHAT DEFINITE INVESTMENT
PLANS ARE THERE FOR THESE RESOURCES?  ONE MUST ESPECIALLY TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE CENTRAL BANK CURRENCY
RESERVES SINCE INFLATION CAN BE A TIME BOMB.  LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO
ASK YOU IF YOU.... [CHANGES THOUGHT] APPARENTLY MY COLLEAGUE REGINA
HAS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BEFORE YOU END THE CONFERENCE WITH ME. THANK
YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

   [CALLEJAS] NO PROBLEM.  I WOULD CONTINUE THIS CONFERENCE ALL NIGHT
LONG, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO KEEP THE HOUSEWIVES FROM THEIR
PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, EVERYTHING HAS A TIME FRAME AND OUR INTEREST IS
THAT ALL REPORTERS HERE TONIGHT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING
PART IN THIS NEWS CONFERENCE.  GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, THE
TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES WAS ESTABLISHED
THIS WAY: THE 1989 BUDGET APPROVED BY CONGRESS WAS 150 MILLION
LEMPIRAS.

   [REPORTER] PERHAPS I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF CLEAR.  I WAS REFERRING TO
THE FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE ONCE LOANS WERE PAID OFF
WITH THESE STOPGAP LOANS.

   [CALLEJAS] YOU ARE RIGHT.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STOPGAP
FINANCING FOR $247 MILLION.  THIS STOPGAP LOAN OPENS THE PATH SO THAT
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES AND BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS CAN RESUME THEIR LOANS TO THE COUNTRY.  THESE FUNDS WILL
GIVE US THE RIGHT TO DRAW ON SPECIAL IMF ACCOUNTS, FUNDS FROM SPECIAL
WORLD BANK PROGRAMS SUCH AS SAL-1 AND SAL-2, OR FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN
WITHHELD FROM JAPAN AND GERMANY.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THESE FUNDS IS
ENOUGH TO PAY THE $247 MILLION STOPGAP LOAN IN FULL AND STILL HAVE
SOME CASH LEFT OVER FOR SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY GENERATE
FUNDS FOR THE COUNTRY.  THE PRECISE AMOUNTS WILL BE GIVEN BY THE
CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT; HOWEVER, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE AMOUNT
OF FUNDS TO BE RECEIVED WILL BE NO LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING LOANED,
PLUS SOME SURPLUSES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FRIENDLY
COUNTRIES, WHICH HAVE WITHHELD THEIR LOANS OR DONATIONS BECAUSE OF
HONDURAS' INELIGIBILITY WITH THE IMF.  [CONTINUED]

BEEN THE NUMBER TWO MAN IN THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), WAS NOMINATED
TODAY AS THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO REPLACE CARLOS PIZARRO
LEONGOMEZ, WHO WAS MURDERED ON 26 APRIL.

   NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO IS A FORMER GUERRILLA LIKE THE SLAIN LEADER,
RECEIVED THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION STOPPED AT
THE HOME OF LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR IN BOGOTA.

   IN A SPEECH MADE TO THE THOUSANDS AT THE FUNERAL, NAVARRO ACCEPTED
THE NOMINATION AND SAID THAT HE WAS PICKING UP THE BANNERS OF THE
SLAIN LEFTIST LEADER.


DEV-MUC3-1249 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 29 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
OF M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENT CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, THE GROUP'S
NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT HIS GROUP WILL
CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.  THE M-19, THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED A
PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ON 8 MARCH AND
LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY, SAID THAT IT
WILL NOT PICK UP ITS WEAPONS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF THE
39-YEAR-OLD PIZARRO.  PIZARRO WAS BURIED YESTERDAY.  ONLY 50 DAYS AFTER
REJOINING CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF ARMED STRUGGLE,
PIZARRO BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEACE, ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS, WITH
HIS DEATH HIS KILLERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

   WHEN ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
A 42-YEAR-OLD ENGINEER, FORMER DEAN OF A UNIVERSITY, REBEL, AND THE
OLDEST OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SAID THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT FOR THAT COLOMBIA WHICH WANTS DEMOCRACY AND WISHES TO LIVE
IN PEACE.  THE NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK AND
ACCEPT THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION MADE A STOP AT
THE HOME OF THE LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR.  HE SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE MUST UNITE TO MAKE HARMONY POSSIBLE, AND HE URGED EVERYONE TO
CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE OF PEACE, A BETTER FUTURE FOR COMING
GENERATIONS.  SPEAKING BEFORE PIZARRO'S CASKET, WHICH WAS DRAPED WITH
THE COLOMBIAN FLAG, NAVARRO, WHO IN 1985 SURVIVED AN ATTACK DURING
WHICH HE LOST A LEG, SWORE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS PIZARRO HAD DONE.

   THE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ATTENDED SATURDAY'S FUNERAL CARRIED
PLACARDS WITH SLOGANS THAT READ: COMMANDER PIZARRO, WE CONTINUE
FORWARD, AND COMRADE PIZARRO, WE ARE FOR PEACE, WE SWEAR.  OTHERS WHO
JOINED THE THOUSANDS OF VOICES ASKING NAVARRO TO ACCEPT THE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BROKE THE SILENCE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO
CHANT: PIZARRO PRESENT, NAVARRO PRESIDENT.

   PIZARRO'S MOTHER MARGOT DE PIZARRO, ALONG WITH HIS LADY FRIEND
LAURA, SPOKE AT THE GRAVE SITE AND ASKED THE CROWD TO FIGHT FOR PEACE
AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE.

   AT THE CEMETERY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE
CROWD, WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE MORE THAN SEVEN-HOUR-LONG FUNERAL
PROCESSION FROM THE CATHEDRAL TO SIMON BOLIVAR'S HOME AND THEN TO THE
CEMETERY.  HE SAID: TOGETHER WITH ALL THE GOOD COLOMBIANS, WE ARE
GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.  HE ADDED THAT PIZARRO'S MURDER
WAS USELESS BECAUSE THE M-19 WILL CONTINUE ITS STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.

   PIZARRO'S FUNERAL WAS HELD IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES PRAISED THE
FACT THAT NO INCIDENTS OR PUBLIC DISORDERS DEVELOPED DURING THE
FUNERAL.  THE M-19 LEADERS HAD ASKED THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM.

   THE NEW COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE SIXTH COMMANDER
M-19 HAS HAD, THE SECOND SINCE THE REBEL GROUP ENTERED ITS NEW PHASE
TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY.  ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF WILL BE RUNNING
AGAINST 12 OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.


DEV-MUC3-1250 (BOEING)

   BUENOS AIRES, 29 APR 90 (CLARIN) -- [ARTICLE] [DANIEL E. ARIAS]
[TEXT] EVERYBODY IS PRAISING AND JUSTIFYING THE ARGENTINE CONDOR II
PROJECT -- THE ONLY ONE WE HAD -- NOW THAT IT HAS OFFICIALLY DIED,
HOWEVER, A MORE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFUNCT PROJECT WILL
REVEAL THE GAP LEFT BY OUR FLIMSY SPACE PROJECT.

   ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF FUEL USED, MISSILES ARE CLASSIFIED AS
SOLID, LIQUID, AND CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES.  THE SOLID-FUELED
MISSILES CARRY THEIR FUEL (THAT BURNS) AND THE COMBURENT (THAT
SUPPLIES THE OXYGEN TO TRIGGER THE COMBUSTION) ON A STICKY ROD, THE
COMBUSTION OF WHICH CANNOT BE REGULATED.  THE CAKE BURNS COMPLETELY
ONCE THE COMBUSTION STARTS.  THEREFORE, SOLID-FUELED MISSILES ARE
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER.
MOREOVER, THEY PUT UP WITH ROUGH HANDLING AND CAN BE EASILY FIRED.
THE MILITARY PREFER THIS TYPE FOR MANUFACTURING SHORT-RANGE MISSILES.

   THE LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THE FUEL AND THE COMBURENT IN
COMPLETELY SEPARATE TANKS.  THE TWO ELEMENTS MEET IN A COMBUSTION
CHAMBER WHERE THEY IGNITE AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH PIPES.  VALVES MAKE
IT POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE POWER OF THE ENGINE.  GROUND PERSONNEL ARE
ABLE TO STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT IN FULL FLIGHT, IN SHORT, TO
CONTROL THE MISSILE AS THEY WISH THROUGH RADIO MESSAGES.

   THE CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 70'S AND
80'S.  THEY CARRY HYDROGEN AND LIQUID GAS WHICH ARE LIGHTER THAN ANY
OTHER PROPELLANT ELEMENT BUT WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REFRIGERATE
AND TO ISOLATE.  THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VERY FAST
VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO.

   THEY ARE USED TO PLACE HUGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES IN SPACE SOME
36,000 KM ABOVE THE EQUATOR, OR TO ATTACK A CITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WORLD.

   LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES REPRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED DURING
THE 50'S AND 60'S AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, EXPLAINS SOVIET LEADERSHIP
IN SPACE RESEARCH.  THESE OLD, HEAVY, CUMBERSOME, AND UNBREAKABLE
MISSILES DO NOT HAVE FRAGILE EQUIPMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PLACE
CARGO INTO OUTER SPACE AT A REASONABLE COST.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
LARGE FAMILY OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CRYOGENIC- FUELED MISSILES CONTINUE
AT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND ARE UNPREDICTABLE (AS THE CASE OF THE
SPACE SHUTTLE AND THE ARIANE IV AND V).  MOREOVER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
COSTLY.

   TOO POOR TO EVEN THINK OF DEVELOPING LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES, BRAZIL
AND ARGENTINA HAVE TRIED TO PLACE SOLID-FUELED VEHICLES INTO ORBIT FOR
DECADES.  THIS IS NOT ALL THAT EASY BECAUSE THESE MISSILES ARE REALLY
LITTLE MORE THAN FLYING RODS [CANITAS VOLADORAS], BUT THE CASTOR,
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY ARGENTINA IN 1978, THE SONDA IV DEVELOPED BY
BRAZIL, AND THE JAPANESE LAUNCHING DEVICES DEVELOPED BY ISAS (A
UNIVERSITY SPACE RESEARCH AGENCY) HAVE PROVED TO BE REASONABLY
MANAGEABLE BEASTS.

   THE CASTOR REPRESENTED THE PHASE PREVIOUS TO DESIGNING A SPACESHIP
AND THIS MUST BE THE REASON WHY IT MYSTERIOUSLY DIED IN 1978 AFTER A
SERIES OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TESTS AND AFTER HAVING ALLOWED US TO
REACH AN AGREEMENT FOR A "JOINT-VENTURE" WITH THE FRG TO STUDY THE
ATMOSPHERE.  THE ABSENCE OF MISTAKES BY A DEBTOR COUNTRY MAY BE FATAL.

   WHEN ARGENTINA ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DISCREETLY THINK ABOUT OUTER
SPACE (1982/83), IT ALREADY HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO CONSIDER LARGER
PROJECTS.  IN FACT, WITH ITS ONE METER DIAMETER TUBE, THE CONDOR COULD
PLACE A 200 KG CARGO IN A LOW POLAR ORBIT OF ONLY 200 KM.

   THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ARGENTINA TO HAVE ONE OR MORE PAIRS
OF EYES IN SPACE SO THAT COULD ASSESS ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, PREDICT
THE WATER FLOW OF RIVERS ON WHICH HYDROELECTRIC DAMS COULD BE BUILT,
DETERMINE WHERE IT COULD FIND OIL AND URANIUM, AND CHEAPLY STOP
ILLEGAL FISHING ON THE CONTINENTAL PLATFORM.  THIS POSSIBILITY COULD
NOT BE ACCEPTED BY SOME PEOPLE.

   BRAZIL, WHICH IS LESS HARD UP, IS ABOUT TO PROGRESS FROM THE SONDA
IV TO THE SONDA V AND HAS OPENLY INVITED US TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE
SPACESHIP.  WHAT WILL ARGENTINA ANSWER?  "WE WILL"?  OR WILL IT HAVE A
CHAUVINIST ATTITUDE?  WHAT A PITY IT DID NOT ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE NOW
THAT IT IS LETTING THE CONDOR PROJECT DIE IN ITS FIRST STAGE -- IT WAS
NEVER TESTED -- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT HAS BEEN.
WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE.

   VERY WELL THEN, IT IS ACCEPTED, THE CONDOR WILL GO NO FURTHER.
WHAT IS LEFT?  VERY LITTLE.  SHOULD WE DEVELOP SATELLITES EXCLUSIVELY
FOR SPACE RESEARCH TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE SUN, OR STUDY THE
COSMIC EXPLOSIONS OF X-RAYS.  THESE ISSUES, IF UNAFFECTED BY ECONOMIC
AND POLITICAL FACTORS, DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY.  THE NASA IS QUITE
WILLING TO GIVE US ROOM, FREE OF CHARGE, ON THEIR ROCKETS FOR THIS
TYPE OF SATELLITES.  THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL GAIN EITHER
MONEY OR SPACE SOVEREIGNTY.  THERE IS NO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT ANY
SIMILARITY BETWEEN THIS POSSIBILITY AND AN INDEPENDENT SPACE RESEARCH
PROGRAM, SUCH AS BRAZIL'S, IS MERE COINCIDENCE.

   IN THE 80'S ARGENTINA ALLOWED ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH AT THAT
TIME WAS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE THIRD WORLD, TO BE HINDERED.  NOW IT
IS ALLOWING ITS WINGS TO BE CLIPPED AND, WITH A STUPID SMILE, IS
YIELDING EVERY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE SOVEREIGNTY IN SPACE.  EACH ATTEMPT
TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY IS LABELLED ARMS ESCALATION BY THOSE CHAMPIONS
OF PEACE, OUR CREDITORS.

   IT IS QUITE TRUE, THE CONDOR II MAY BE A MISSILE, AS A CARGO
AIRCRAFT MAY DROP BOMBS AND A TRUCK MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH ARTILLERY FOR
WAR.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT ARGENTINA MUST STOP MANUFACTURING ALL TYPE
OF VEHICLES?  THIS QUESTION IS NOT POINTLESS IN A COUNTRY THAT REFUSES
TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS.

   QUITO, 30 APR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] ECUADORAN SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARY PEDRO SAAD ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT A GROUP OF COLOMBIANS
DRESSED AS MILITARY MEN ON 28 APRIL KIDNAPPED U.S. CITIZEN SCOTT
HEYNDAL, KILLED A COLOMBIAN, AND WOUNDED AN ECUADOREAN.

   HEYNDAL AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE TRAVELING ABOARD A SMALL BOAT ON
THE SAN MIGUEL RIVER IN THE AMAZON REGION WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED WITH
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BY THE COLOMBIANS FROM A LARGER VESSEL.  


DEV-MUC3-1252 (BOEING)

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] THE ARMY, SEINELDIN
BELIEVES, IS DIVIDED INTO ''NATIONALIST'' AND ''ADMINISTRATIVE'' FACTIONS,
AND WARNS HE ''CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THEY CLASH.'' IF A
SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND SOON, ''LIBERALISM OR THE LEFT IS GOING TO MAKE
HEADWAY AND ENCIRCLE US, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES TO
DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS,'' SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY REPORTS.

   THE PRESS ALSO REPORTS SEINELDIN'S COMMENTS REGARDING THE UNITED
STATES.  DURING HIS VISIT TO MENDOZA, FOR INSTANCE, HE ADVOCATED A
''CIVILIAN-MILITARY ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT THE TWO IMPERIALISMS,
REPRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION,'' ACCORDING TO
LA NACION OF 21 MARCH.  SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY QUOTES SEINELDIN AS
STATING THAT ''THE WORLD IS DIVIDED, AND WHAT WAS THE THIRD WORLD HAS
BEEN INFILTRATED BY IMPERIALISM AND COMMUNISM.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN
HOW THE UNITED STATES BLOCKADED VENEZUELA AND IS NOW TRYING TO DO THE
SAME WITH MEXICO, WHERE IT HAS INSTALLED A SINGLE PARTY.  DRUG
TRAFFICKING WILL BE GIVEN AS AN EXCUSE FOR INVADING IT.''

   LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT

   LA PRENSA OF 13 MARCH ANALYZES A SURVEY ON SEINELDIN'S POPULARITY
CONDUCTED BY THE DEMOSKOPIA INSTITUTE FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND
POLITICAL STUDIES.  ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, ''SEINELDIN IS BETTER
KNOWN THAN MANY POLITICIANS'' AND CABINET MEMBERS, SINCE 91 PERCENT OF
THE POPULATION KNOWS OR HAS HEARD ABOUT HIM.  THE SURVEY SHOWS 20
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION APPROVES OF HIM, 40 PERCENT DISAPPROVES,
WHILE 21 PERCENT IS UNDECIDED.  THE DEMOSKOPIA STUDY ALSO POINTS OUT
THAT, ALTHOUGH SEINELDIN MAY HAVE ''HALF OF PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST
HIM,'' THERE IS ''A LARGE PERCENTAGE THAT DOES NOT YET HAVE A DEFINITE
OPINION,'' AND THAT ''DEPENDING ON SEINELDIN'S POLITICAL SKILL AND ON
HOW MUCH THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE,' HE COULD
INCREASE HIS FOLLOWING, PARTICULARLY FROM AMONG THE UNDECIDED.

   ACCORDING TO AN OPINION POLL CONDUCTED IN LATE FEBRUARY BY THE
UNION STUDY CENTER FOR THE NEW MAJORITY AND REPORTED IN LA NACION OF
23 MARCH, SEINELDIN IS SEEN IN A MORE POSITIVE LIGHT OUTSIDE THE
CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES, AMONG PEOPLE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF
EDUCATION, AND AMONG SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING JUSTICIALIST PARTY.
MORE SPECIFIALLY:.

   GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION--IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES, SEINELDIN
RECEIVED 14 PERCENT FAVORABLE AND 40 PERCENT NEGATIVE RATINGS; IN
GREATER BUENOS AIRES, 26 AND 32 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY; AND IN THE
NORTHWEST REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, 41 PERCENT FAVORABLE VERSUS 30
PERCENT UNFAVORABLE.

   LEVEL OF EDUCATION--IN THE CAPITAL AND GREATER BUENOS AIRES,
SEINELDIN HAS A 19 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 14 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WHO COMPLETED SECONDARY
SCHOOL, AND 10 PERCENT AMONG THOSE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES.

   POLITICAL AFFILIATION--SURVEY PARTICIPANTS WHO VOTED FOR THE
RADICAL PARTY DURING THE LAST NATIONAL ELECTIONS GIVE SEINELDIN A 7
PERCENT APPROVAL RATING, THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE UNITED LEFT GIVE HIM
8 PERCENT, AND AMONG THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE MENEM-DUHALDE TICKET HIS
APPROVAL RATE IS 25 PERCENT.

   MILITARY CONCERNS

   MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOW SALARIES AND THE SHARP
DECREASE IN PURCHASING POWER, ACCORDING TO AN 11 MARCH ARTICLE IN LA
PRENSA.  THEIR DISSATISFACTION, WHICH WAS PUBLICIZED IN A FLIER WHICH
APPEARED IN SEVERAL PROVINCIAL GARRISONS, WAS DISCUSSED DURING
SEINELDIN'S MEETING WITH COMMISSIONED AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN
SANTA FE, ACCORDING TO SOMOS OF 14 FEBRUARY.

   THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOCIAL EXPLOSION AND THE RELUCTANCE OF THE
''CARAPINTADAS'' TO INTERVENE WERE DISCUSSED DURING SEINELDIN'S
MEETINGS IN ROSARIO, ACCORDING TO THE 14 FEBRUARY ISSUE OF SOMOS.
''WE CANNOT ENGAGE IN REPRESSION, AND THAT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF
PROBLEMS FOR THE SECURITY FORCES,'' AN ''AUTHORIZED SPOKEMAN''
REPORTEDLY CONFIDED.  IF THE ECONOMY DETERIORATES AND SOCIAL UNREST
ENSUES, ''UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE INCLINED TO
TAKE THE PLACE OF THE POLICE FORCES IN GUARDING SUPERMARKETS OR ANY
PLACE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS 'VITAL TO THE NATION,'' ACCORDING TO
THE 11 MARCH ISSUE OF LA PRENSA.


DEV-MUC3-1253 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] THE HIGH COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES IS ANALYZING NEWS REPORTS ABOUT COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION, HAVING SAID THAT THE OFFICER
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS "FOLLOWED ORDERS
FROM ABOVE".

   OCHOA MADE THOSE COMMENTS ON A U.S. TELEVISION NEWSCAST AT A TIME
WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS OF [THE U.S.] CONGRESS WANT TO CUT AID TO EL
SALVADOR AND ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE.  THE
RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WILL BE KNOWN NEXT WEEK.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS CONFIRMED ON THE
MORNING OF 24 APRIL THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS ANALYZING OCHOA'S
DECLARATIONS AND STRESSED THAT VERSIONS SUCH AS THE ONE ATTRIBUTED TO
THE OFFICIAL USUALLY COME FROM "INTERESTED PARTIES."

   LARIOS, QUESTIONED WHEN HE BID FAREWELL TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, WHO LEFT FOR NICARAGUA ON 24 APRIL, SAID THAT "THE CASE IS
IN THE COURTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE MAY APPROACH THEM TO
CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT IT MAY BE SOLVED."

   "BOTH THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE CLARIFIED
WITHIN A FAIR AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK," HE SAID.

   ARMY OFFICERS WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID ON 24 APRIL THAT
"THE COMMENTS MADE BY OCHOA, CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER
KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS, HAVE NO BASIS BECAUSE HE HAS NO
ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL ARMED FORCES SOURCES DUE TO HIS RETIRED
STATUS."

   HOWEVER, THE INFORMERS HAVE SAID THAT "WHAT OCHOA SAID NOT ONLY
DAMAGES THE ARMY'S IMAGE, BUT THAT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHILE IT
CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEFAMATION CAMPAIGN BEING CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY
INTERESTED PARTIES, AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT]."

   THEY ADDED THAT OCHOA'S DECLARATION, "MADE WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY
PROOF, ENDANGERS THE MILITARY AID THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERS TO EL
SALVADOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FAVORS THE INTERNATIONALIST LEFT WHICH
INTENDS TO PLAY THE LAST CARD IT HAS TO ASSAULT POWER IN THIS
COUNTRY."

   THE POLITICIANS' IMMEDIATE REACTION TO OCHOA PEREZ' COMMENTS WAS TO
DEMAND THAT HE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN HIS ACCUSATION.  PDC [CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY] LEADER EDUARDO COLINDRES SAID IN A PRESS CONFERENCE
THAT "OCHOA PEREZ HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF NAMING" THOSE OF HIS
COMRADES-IN-ARMS HE IMPLICATES IN THE DEATH OF THE JESUITS, SINCE THE
VERSION HE GAVE TO THE TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT INTERVIEWED HIM IS
VAGUE.

   THE POLITICIAN SAID: "IF HE KNOWS SOMETHING, IT IS TIME THAT HE
BRING IT OUT INTO A PUBLIC LIGHT SO THAT JUSTICE AUTHORITIES MAY TAKE
THE APPROPRIATE PATHS."

   MEANWHILE, IN MANAGUA, SPANISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED
VIOLETA CHAMORRO'S INAUGURATION SAID THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY
THE SLUGGISH MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE JESUITS' CASE
ARE APPARENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT.  THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT MENTION
THE TOPIC DURING THE MEETINGS THEY WILL HOLD WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
IN NICARAGUA.

   REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. QUOTE THE LEFTIST LEADER OF THE FDR,
GUILLERMO MANUEL UNGO, AS SAYING THAT "HIS EFFORTS IN THE AMERICAN
CAPITAL TO EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, ARE A SUCCESS."

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT UNGO AND HIS MARXIST-LENINIST ALLIES WANT THE
U.S. SENATE TO STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THE SOURCES
ALSO SAID THAT UNGO DISCREDITS THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND FAVORS
THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE REBEL GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE LEFTIST INTERNATIONALISTS
HAVE UNLEASHED A NEW DISINFORMATION OFFENSIVE AGAINST EL SALVADOR WITH
THE AID OF BAD SALVADORANS," THE SOURCES SAID.

   REFERRING TO OTHER COMMUNIST MOVES IN THE COUNTRY, GENERAL LARIOS
SAID THAT THE LOCAL LEFTISTS ARE PREPARING TO STAGE TERRORIST ACTIONS
AND STREET DISTURBANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF
COMMEMORATING LABOR DAY.

   LARIOS URGED THE FMLN-FDR TERRORISTS TO REFRAIN FROM PERPETRATING
VIOLENT ACTIONS, THUS CREATING AN ADEQUATE CLIMATE FOR THE "DIALOGUE"
ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD ON 3 MAY.  "OTHERWISE, THE
TERRORISTS WOULD BE VIOLATING THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE," LARIOS
POINTED OUT.

   IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA THAT FMLN-FDR
LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE PREPARED ANOTHER OFFENSIVE FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ELICITED STRONG REJECTION BY
VARIOUS SECTORS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 1 MAY 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] FOLLOWING A
MEETING OF THE GENERAL STAFF WITH ALL THE BRIGADE AND DETACHMENT COMMANDERS,
THE ARMED FORCES TODAY ISSUED A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE DESCRIBING THE RECENT
STATEMENTS BY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
TENDENTIOUS.  IN PARTS, THE COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT:

   1.  WE EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE RECENT STATEMENTS
BY DISCHARGED COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL AND
FOREIGN MEDIA.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND TENDENTIOUS AND
SEEK TO CREATE CONFUSION AND DISTRUST IN THE NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES BY TRYING TO INVOLVE THE MEMBERS OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE REGRETTABLE CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND
THEIR WORKERS.

   2.  WE DEMAND THAT BOTH COL. OCHOA PEREZ, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
PERSON HAVING ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO CLARIFYING THIS CASE
OR ANY OTHER CASE, PRESENT IT TO THE CORRESPONDING TRIBUNALS AND NOT
TRY TO OBTAIN POLITICAL PROFIT BASED ON ALLEGED STATEMENTS THAT ARE
ADDED ON TO THE CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION THAT IS BEING CARRIED OUT
IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARXIST-LENINIST
TERRORISTS.

   3.  WE CONDEMN SUCH IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AS THEY SEEK TO
UNDERMINE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE, AND ONLY FAVOR THE DARK
AND NEFARIOUS INTERESTS OF THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY.

   IN CONCLUDING, THE ARMED FORCES COMMUNIQUE REAFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT
TO THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND
POINTED OUT THAT THE INSTITUTION IS RULED BY SOLID PROFESSIONAL,
MORAL, AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.  WITH THIS STATEMENT, ALL THE
COMMANDERS GIVE THEIR UNCONDITIONAL VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES.

LAUNCHED SEVERAL ATTACKS ON SEVERAL POINTS OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT CAUSING BLACKOUTS AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD, IN
ADDITION TO CAUSING PANIC AMONG THE CITIZENRY.

   MILITARY SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS BEGAN AT
2130 AND WERE AIMED AT THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES' ACADEMY, LOCATED IN
THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, AND MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE
WEALTHY ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE THE SHERATON HOTEL IS LOCATED.

   A HEAVY BARRAGE OF RIFLE FIRE AND EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FOR
APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR IN THE SAN RAMON AREA, LOCATED IN THE
NORTHWESTERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR, WHILE ONE AIR FORCE HELICOPTER
OVERFLEW THE CITY.

   THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS OF ATTACKS ON A MILITARY POST AT THE
CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE NORTHWESTERN
OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL.

   SIMULTANEOUSLY, URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS ATTACKED THE CIVIL
DEFENSE GROUP IN THE COSTA RICA NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOUTHERN SAN SALVADOR.

   SEVERAL ELECTRIC POLES WERE BROUGHT DOWN IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE
CITY, CAUSING BLACKOUTS OVER LARGE AREAS.

   THERE ARE STILL NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND
WOUNDED.

   EARLY THIS MORNING, GUERRILLA COLUMNS ATTACKED THE 1ST INFANTRY

A NEW MILITARY MANEUVER BY THE GUERILLAS TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT INTO
RENEWING THE DIALOGUE.

   AT LEAST 10 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THE HARASSMENT AND
ATTACKS BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT] IN
SEVEN OF THE COUNTRY'S 14 DEPARTMENTS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY
SABOTAGE TO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE SYSTEM.  THE ATTACKS STARTED AT 2030
ON 2 MAY AND CONTINUED UNTIL LATE THIS MORNING. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE NATIONAL ENERGY ENTERPRISE REPORTED THAT ELECTRIC POWER WILL BE
RATIONED FOR AT LEAST FOUR HOURS DURING THIS MORNING IN MOST OF THE

   MEANWHILE, FMLN SPOKESMEN MADE A TELEPHONE CALL TO A LOCAL RADIO
STATION REPORTING THAT THE MILITARY MANEUVER UNLEASHED ON THE NATIONAL
LEVEL IS AIMED AT PRESSURING THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT TO RENEW
THE DIALOGUE.

   TALKS BETWEEN THE FNLM AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE SCHEDULED TO START

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [TEXT] COMMUNIQUE ISSUED
BY THE GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN: WE ANNOUNCE THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 1
MAY AND THE EARLY MORNING OF 2 MAY, OUR FORCES CONDUCTED SEVERAL MILITARY
OPERATIONS IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER CITIES OF THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE TO:

   1. THE PREVAILING TOTAL IMPUNITY OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN
VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE STANDSTILL REACHED IN
THE TRIAL, THE EVIDENT COVER UP OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE RELEASE OF THE GROUP OF
KIDNAPPERS, AND THE RECENT MURDER OF A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A
COOPERATIVE LEADER.

   2.  THE MILITARY OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN RURAL
AREAS WITH INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND ARRESTS OF CIVILIANS.

   3.  THE ARROGANT AND BOASTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
MILITARY BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED WEAKNESS SHOWN BY THE FMLN, WHICH
OBSTRUCTS THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

   4.  THE UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MEASURES AND THE PLANS TO CARRY OUT THE
BIGGEST ECONOMIC FRAUD AND ACT OF CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY
WITH THE PRIVATIZATION OF BANKS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT:

   1.  THE U.S. CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO CUT ONLY 50 PERCENT OF THE
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ENOUGH.  ANY ASSISTANCE
TO TERRORIST ARMED FORCES ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO WAR AND REDUCES THE
POSSIBILITY FOR A SHORT-TERM CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT.

   2.  AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FOR THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, AS
LONG AS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE MILITARY GO UNPUNISHED, AND AS LONG AS
REPRESSION DOES NOT STOP, WAR WILL CONTINUE.

   FINALLY WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATION
PROCESS.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED OUR POSITIONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT AND ARE AWAITING ITS REPLY SO THAT WE CAN START HOLDING THE
NEGOTIATIONS.  [SIGNED] GENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 2 MAY 90 (NOTIMEX) -- [TEXT] THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT [M - 19] TODAY ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF
ASSASSINATING M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.

   "WE ATTRIBUTE PIZARRO'S DEATH TO THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES,"
SAID M-19 DIRECTORATE MEMBER RAFAEL VERGARA DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
HELD IN MEXICO CITY.

   THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FORMER REBEL GROUP
TURNED POLITICAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL
GROUP TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' LIVES.

   MIGUEL MARIN, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE M-19'S DIRECTORATE, POINTED OUT
THE NEED FOR VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGNATE
POLITICAL PERSONALITIES WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS.

   "WE INTEND TO CHECK THE TRIGGERS OF THE COLOMBIAN OLIGARCHY, WHO
ARE TO BLAME FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS," THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT'S REPRESENTATIVES SAID.

   THEY DENIED THAT THE M-19 IS IN FAVOR OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, BUT
ADVOCATED THE LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS AND THE NONEXTRADITION OF DRUG
PRODUCERS.

   THE M-19 MEMBERS SAID THAT THE CLARIFICATION OF THEIR TOP LEADER'S
DEATH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF VIRGILIO BARCO'S REGIME.
THEY SAID THAT PIZARRO'S BASIC PROPOSALS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY WILL BE
TAKEN UP BY ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO REPLACED PIZARRO AS THE M-19'S
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THEY ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP PUT AN END TO THE
ARMS TRAFFIC TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IN 1989 FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED
BY 148 PERCENT OVER THAT OF 1988.

   "WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS IS TO ATTAIN PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE.  FOR
THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK AND NEGOTIATE WITH ALL OF THE
INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,"
VERGARA AND MARIN POINTED OUT.  


DEV-MUC3-1260 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] A GROUP PURPORTEDLY
REPRESENTING YOUNG SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS HAS CALLED FOR A PURGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HERE, ACCUSING THEIR SUPERIORS OF INVOLVEMENT IN
THE MASSACRE OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.

   THE CALL CAME WEDNESDAY IN THE WAKE OF A BOLD OFFENSIVE BY LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS WHO ATTACKED STRATEGIC TARGETS ACROSS THE CAPITAL,
INCLUDING THE RESIDENCE OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN A SHOW OF
FORCE BEFORE PEACE TALKS.

   THE STATEMENT DISTRIBUTED TO NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WAS MADE IN THE
NAME OF A "COMMANDO OF YOUNG OFFICERS."  IT GAVE NO NAMES BUT SAID THE
GROUP WAS FORMED SECRETLY AMONG OFFICERS FED UP WITH CORRUPTION BY A
SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS.

   IF AUTHENTIC, THE STATEMENT WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME SINCE A 1979
MILITARY COUP THAT A GROUP OF JUNIOR OFFICERS HAD BROKEN RANKS WITH EL
SALVADOR'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP.

   "TODAY MORE THAN EVER, ALL THE OFFICERS WHO TRULY WANT TO SAVE OUR
INSTITUTION, MUST DEMAND AND EXACT PROFOUND CHANGES AND A GENERAL
PURGE AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ARMED FORCES," THE STATEMENT SAID.

   THE STATEMENT BLAMED A THREATENED LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY AID ON A
FEW CORRUPT OFFICERS WHOM IT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "EXECRABLE"
ASSASSINATIONS OF SIX ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS DURING A REBEL OFFENSIVE
IN NOVEMBER.

   EL SALVADOR IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE 315.4 MILLION DOLLARS IN U.S.
AID THIS YEAR, 85 MILLION DOLLARS OF IT IN MILITARY AID.  BUT THE U.S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS VOTED TO CUT MILITARY AID IN HALF AND
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER HAS WARNED THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR
WILL DEPEND ON PROGRESS IN THE PRIESTS' CASE.

   THE PRIESTS, THEIR HOUSEKEEPER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE MURDERED IN
THEIR RESIDENCE NOVEMBER 16 IN THE MIDST OF PROLONGED AND BLOODY
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CITY.  NINE MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE KILLINGS BUT MR. CRISTIANI HAS
EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THEY WILL BE CONVICTED.

   "IT IS TRULY SAD AND INFURIATING FOR US THAT THE LOSS OF PRESTIGE
OF THE ARMED FORCES HAS GROWN SO MUCH THAT INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE SEEN
AS THE ONES TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS IN," SAID THE
STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE YOUNG OFFICERS.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN), MEANWHILE,
ALSO SAID ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR EARLY WEDNESDAY WERE TO PROTEST
THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN PROSECUTING MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FOR THE
MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS.

   BUT ANALYSTS SAID THE RENEWED FIGHTING APPEARED INTENDED AS A SHOW
OF FORCE AHEAD OF U.N.-MEDIATED PEACE [WORD INDISTINCT] THIS MONTH,
WHICH SEEK TO END A DECADE-LONG CIVIL WAR THAT HAS LEFT MORE THAN
70,000 DEAD.

   IN THE FIGHTING EARLY WEDNESDAY, AT LEAST SEVEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS
WERE KILLED AND 18 WERE WOUNDED, AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID.  THERE WERE
NO CASUALTIES IN THE ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE AND MR.
CRISTIANI WAS NOT AT HOME AT THE TIME, THE SPOKESMAN SAID.

   THE REBELS RETREATED TO THEIR STRONGHOLD AROUND THE SAN SALVADOR
VOLCANO JUST NORTH OF THE CAPITAL AFTER THE ATTACKS IN UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS.

   THE UNITED STATES SHARPLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AND CALLED ON THE
REBELS TO DEMONSTRATE THEY CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR
TO END THE WAR.

   "WE CONDEMN THE OUTRAGEOUS VIOLENCE BY THE FMLN," SAID STATE
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN RICHARD BOUCHER.  "THE FMLN HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT
IT CAN DESTROY THE SALVADORAN ECONOMY AND KILL SALVADORAN CITIZENS."


DEV-MUC3-1261 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] THE YOUNG MILITARY
OFFICERS WHO HAVE CIRCULATED A 5-PAGE LETTER OUTLINING THEIR VIEWS CONTEND
THAT THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE NEGLECT IN CORRECTING WRONGDOINGS
COMMITTED BY THE U.S. ADVISERS AND EMBASSY ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS KEEPING THE
COUNTRY MIRED IN WAR. THE OFFICERS ADD THAT THEY DO NOT TRUST THE CURRENT
U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHOM THEY ACCUSE OF BETRAYING TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN THE
COUNTRY IN CONNECTION WITH THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.

   THE OFFICERS NOTE THE DIPLOMAT'S POSITION REGARDING THE CASE OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS; HOW HE FAILED TO DENOUNCE A COLONEL WHO ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED THE CULPRITS AND HOW, LATELY, HE HAS WARNED THE HIGH
COMMAND ABOUT SOME INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC BY A
U.S. NETWORK.

   THE LETTER, WHICH WAS RELEASED DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS AND IS
DATED 1 MAY, EXPRESSES THE YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS SUPPORT FOR COLONEL
SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ, AFTER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WITH THE BLESSING
OF SEVERAL COMMANDERS, DECIDED TO TAKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF CEL
[LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE] TO TASK PUBLICLY.  IN
THEIR LETTER, THE OFFICERS STATE THAT THEY AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE
FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER REGARDING WHICH SENIOR OFFICERS GIVE ORDERS
TO JUNIOR OFFICERS.

   WE ARE OBEDIENT AND NONCONFRONTATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE
TO OBEY ORDERS FROM SUPERIORS, BUT THIS MUST STOP WHEN THE VIOLATION
OF PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS ARE INVOLVED, SAYS THE CALL FROM THE YOUNG
OFFICERS TO THE PRESIDENT AND HIGH COMMAND.

   THE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT DELIVERED TO THE MEDIA BY THE SELF-STYLED
DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT SAYS THAT TWO OF THE OFFICERS IT
MENTIONS WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR POSTS IN THE MILITARY ORDER OF 30
APRIL.  THE YOUNG OFFICERS PROVIDE NO FURTHER DETAILS BUT MAKE SOME
ALLUSIONS TO MISSIONS CONDUCTED WHILE THEY DID THEIR DUTIES.

   THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE
OBTAINING MONEY ILLEGALLY MUST STOP AND MENTIONS THE NAMES OF FORMER
MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW LIVING AND ENJOYING THEIR WEALTH IN
EXILE.  THE DOCUMENT SAYS THAT THE CONTRADICTION RAISED BY THE ABOVE
IS THE LUCK OF SOME GENTLEMEN OFFICERS WHO, AT THE END OF THEIR
SERVICE, LIVE ABROAD AND ENJOY THEIR POSITIONS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION.
THE DOCUMENT ASKS HOW SOME FORMER OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO LIVE SO WELL
WHEN WE KNOW THEY GRADUATED FROM OUR MILITARY ALMA MATER.

   THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ALSO EXAMINED IN THEIR LETTER.
THEY NOTE THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE CULPRITS BECAME KNOWN SHORTLY AFTER
THE MURDER, BUT SOME OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS WITHHELD IMPORTANT
INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND ARMED FORCES
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  A FEW HOURS AFTER THE MURDER, MANY OF US
SUSPECTED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  WE, THE YOUNG OFFICERS, HAVE THE BEST
SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND MANY OF US DID NOT THINK THAT THE CASE
WOULD HAVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT BECAUSE THE ACTIVISM OF THE PRIESTS WITH
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL FRONT [FMLN] WAS WELL-KNOWN.  HOWEVER,
THERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRIME BECAME
KNOWN.  THE PRIESTS' MURDER WAS DESCRIBED AS IRRATIONAL AND SENSELESS
BECAUSE OPEN FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISM IS ONE THING AND THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE IDEOLOGISTS IS ANOTHER.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT THE
FMLN HATCHING A PLOT TO MURDER THE SAN SALVADOR BISHOPS IN AN ATTEMPT
TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE KILLING OF THE PRIESTS, THE LETTER
SAYS.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD NOT BE REACHED FOR COMMENT ABOUT
THIS. AS STATED BY THE YOUNG OFFICERS, WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
IDEA WAS RAISED, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE.
THIS WAS TREATED AS A CHILDISH AND ILLOGICAL WAY OUT.  THE GROSS LIE
MADE UP BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS NEVER CONSIDERED A PRACTICAL
OPTION, THE DOCUMENT SAYS.

   THE SELF-STYLED DOMINGO MONTERROSA LIVES MOVEMENT HAS SENT THE
LETTER TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE ARMED
FORCES HIGH COMMAND, ASKING THEM TO MEASURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
POSITION ASSUMED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY AND VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE
COUNTRY REGARDING MILITARY AID.  THE YOUNG OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN THE
NAME OF THE CHARISMATIC OFFICER WHO DIED WHEN HIS HELICOPTER WAS
ATTACKED WHILE FLYING OVER THE AREA OF CACAOPERA, IN THE NORTHERN PART
OF THE COUNTRY'S EASTERN REGION.

   IN THEIR EXTENSIVE DOCUMENT THE YOUNG OFFICERS ASK PRESIDENT
CRISTINI NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY REPORTS FROM THE HIGH COMMAND MEMBERS
OF LA TANDONA [NAME GIVEN TO 1966 GRADUATES OF CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY].

   CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO PUT
TOGETHER A VIABLE AGENDA FOR ITS UPCOMING MEETING WITH THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] SO THAT SOME HEADWAY CAN BE
MADE IN THE TALKS.  HE ADDS: "FROM WHAT WE CAN FORESEE, WE HOPE THE
DIRECT MEETINGS WILL BEGIN IN A WEEK AND A HALF, OR SOMEWHERE AROUND
THERE.  THAT IS WHEN WE THINK THEY COULD START....  IN GENERAL TERMS,
WE DO BELIEVE PROGRESS WILL BE MADE AND THAT WE WILL ADVANCE QUITE
RAPIDLY."

   IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION REGARDING A LETTER FROM AN UNNAMED GROUP
OF YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS ADVOCATING A PURGE OF THE MILITARY AND
SUPPORTING CRITICISMS MADE BY FORMER ARMY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS OR
NOTES.  THE FACT THAT IT IS ANONYMOUS CASTS SOME DOUBT ON THE
INTENTIONS BEHIND IT OR ABOUT THE GROUP THAT COULD BE SENDING IT.
POSING AS YOUNG OFFICERS IS EASY TO DO.  THIS COULD HAVE COME FROM THE
FMLN -- MAKING AN ISSUE OF ALL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OR
FROM ANY OTHER GROUP."

   REGARDING THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE REBELS' RECENT MILITARY
OFFENSIVE, HE STATES: "I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO
DATE....  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE
NEWS.  THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE
THAT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES....  SOME OF THEM VIEW
THE DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE
THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY
THE FMLN."

   TURNING TO RECENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CRITICISM CHARGING SLOWNESS IN
THE HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN
THE JESUIT MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI SAYS: "AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE, I CANNOT
SPEED UP, SLOW DOWN, OR ALTER THE JUDGE'S DECISIONS.  IN NO DEMOCRACY
CAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DICTATE ORDERS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  THE
SAME HAPPENS IN THE UNITED STATES AS IN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS
MUCH URGENCY IN SEEING THIS TRIAL COMPLETED; THERE ARE GREAT
EXPECTATIONS -- THAT THE JUDGE IS DUTY BOUND TO CONTINUE WITH THE
JUDICIAL PROCEDURES STIPULATED BY SALVADORAN LAW."  HE POINTS OUT THAT
THE PROSECUTION OF GENERAL NORIEGA IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO TAKING
A LONG TIME.

   REGARDING A REPORTED FMLN ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN SAN SALVADOR
YESTERDAY, CRISTIANI SAYS: "I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON WAS WHO
REPORTED AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, EITHER THE OFFICIAL
OR THE PRIVATE ONE.  NEITHER OF THEM WAS ATTACKED, THOUGH THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WAS EXPECTED.  AN FMLN
COLUMN WAS DISPERSED IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE TWO RESIDENCES."

   QUESTIONED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S.
GOVERNMENT AID TO EL SALVADOR, CRISTIANI RESPONDS:  "WELL, I THINK THAT
FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECTS OF A REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.
FIRST, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE
OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED; AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY
SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY
VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE
CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE.  SECOND, OBVIOUSLY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED
DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED
FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL
PROGRAMS -- ...  FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES."

   RETURNING THE JESUITS MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI IS ASKED IF THE MILITARY
HIGH COMMAND IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAYS:  "FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY
THAT THE HIGH COMMAND -- AND THIS IS JUST MY OWN POINT OF VIEW -- WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION.  THE HIGH
COMMAND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION TO BE WITHIN THE ARMED
FORCES, AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO
INVESTIGATING MILITARY UNITS....  IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT
BY SUPPORTING THE INVESTIGATION AND OPENING UP THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THEY
CAN BE INVESTIGATED IN THIS CASE, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO IF THERE WERE SOME
INVOLVEMENT ON THEIR PART."

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] JUAN AMADEO CABRERA FROM LA NOTICIA.

   [CABRERA] MR. PRESIDENT, IF THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE YOUNG
MILITARY OFFICERS IS TRUE, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES, WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ARMED FORCES AND FOR YOUR
GOVERNMENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE SOME SPECULATION WOULD BE REQUIRED.  I
BELIEVE THAT AS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER, IT CANNOT BE GIVEN THE CREDIT IT
DESERVES, IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE.
IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN WILLING TO
CONDUCT A PROCESS OF PROFESSIONALIZING AND MODERNIZING.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR INSTITUTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

   [MODERATOR] LUISA MELGAR FROM TELEPRENSA.

   [MELGAR] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY THE FMLN CARRIED OUT DIFFERENT
ARMED ACTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED
BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND JUSTIFIED THE ACTIONS BECAUSE OF ALLEGED
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, REPRESSION, AND LACK OF SECURITY FOR
CIVILIANS.  HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE ACTIONS JUST WHEN THE TALKS ARE
ABOUT TO BEGIN?

   [CRISTIANI] I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS
ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE.  IT
IS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY.  I
BELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD.
ALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY.
THEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD
AND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  I FEEL
THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS.  THIS COULD BE
ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING
PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE
ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.  SOME OF THEM VIEW THE
DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE
THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY
THE FMLN.  I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR
ACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.  THAT IS NOT ALL.  THEY HAVE
EVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE
PAST.  THIS SHOWS THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERITY IN ALL OF
THEM, OR SOME OF THEM, CONCERNING THE OBJECTIVES WE ARE TRYING TO
ACHIEVE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.

   [CRISTIANI] GUILLERMO PENATE FROM EL DIARIO DE HOY.

   [PENATE] THERE ARE SOME LABOR GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN
THE DELEGATION THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS WITH THE FMLN.
COULD THIS NOT BE SOME SORT OF DISADVANTAGE FOR THE OFFICIAL
DELEGATION, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE GROUPS COULD GAIN STRENGTH?

   [CRISTIANI] I THINK THAT IS TRUE.  SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE
INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION.  I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
DIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE
ALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION
OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO
CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF
MEMBERS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE
PAST.

   [MODERATOR] RAUL BELTRAN FROM RADIO CADENA YSKL.

   [BELTRAN] MR. PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED
ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS
GARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
OF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED,
WHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ?

   [CRISTIANI] CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL
PEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE.  THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC
SPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.  IF
SOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS
REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  HE SHOULD NOT
CONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT
OBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.

   I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A
DELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE
PLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL
PROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE
UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN
PUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED.  IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR
EVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE
CONFUSION.  IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES
COMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT.  IN
MANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING
THE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND
STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC
WITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] HOWEVER, THE FMLN IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW
FORCE HERE, OR THERE, OR SOMEWHERE IS NOT LOGICAL.  THE IMPORTANT
POINT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND
TRANQUILITY.  THEREFORE, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT THEY MAY HAVE
1,000, 2,000, OR 100.  THAT DOES NOT MATTER.  I THINK THAT, WHETHER
THEY HAVE A HIGH OR A LOW MORALE OR WHATEVER, WITH JUST 100 RADICALS
THEY COULD KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT.  IN SUM,
THEY CAUSE PANIC AND TERROR IN SOME HAMLETS.  I BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE
STOPPED.  IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHO SHOWS FORCE AND WHO DOES NOT.
REGARDLESS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF FORCE THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT, WE
STILL BELIEVE THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, THE MILITARY VICTORY BY THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
STRONG MORAL SUPPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE
AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE
SYSTEM AND THE GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHO IS HEADING IT, NOT JUST A
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.  HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE POINT.  WE DO NOT
WANT THIS CONFLICT TO LAST 10 YEARS LONGER, WITH MORE BLOODSHED.
THEREFORE, WE ARE SEARCHING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE IN IT, NOT BECAUSE IT SUITS US BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONGER OR
NOT STRONGER.

   [MODERATOR] JAMES LOHMAN.

   [LOHMAN] MR. PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS
CONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT
A COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY?

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND
THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY
HAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO
STATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO
COMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE
OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THOSE
POLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO
HELP THE NEEDY.  THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK
ABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID.  I BELIEVE THAT IS
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND
THE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER --
WHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL.

   [LOHMAN] HAVE YOU CONSIDERED [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES.  HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE
THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEFENSELESS.

   [MODERATOR] WE WILL NOW HAVE QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH.  TOM GIBBS FROM
THE BBC.

   [GIBBS] WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF CUTTING U.S.  MILITARY AID?  AND ALSO
IT SEEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE
CONTINUATION OF AID THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] JESUITS' CASE, AND ALSO THE
CLEANING UP OF THE OFFICERS CORPS OF THE ARMY, OR CHANGES IN THE MILITARY.
HOW INCONVENIENT WOULD IT BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, OR HOW [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IT WOULD BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECT OF THE REDUCTION
OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.  ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A
NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END
TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT
A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF
THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT,
THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT
MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL
DIALOGUE.  SECONDLY, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND
WILL NOT STAND BY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS
REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS --
SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN
HAVE ACCESS TO, AND OBVIOUSLY TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES.
THUS, IT WOULD HAVE A TWOFOLD IMPACT IF THAT WAS THE CASE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CASE OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ONGOING.  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TO THINK THAT BEFORE IT HAS ENDED, THAT THERE IS
PREJUDGEMENT ON WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD BE.  I THINK THAT THE JUDGE, AS
I SAID EARLIER, HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST THE VISITS OF MANY PEOPLE.  JUST
RECENTLY A GROUP OF LAWYERS FROM SPAIN CAME IN AND ANALYZED THE CASE,
AND WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE CASE,
ACCORDING, OBVIOUSLY, TO SALVADORAN LAW.  [CONTINUED]


DEV-MUC3-1265 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ
(JONAS), A TOP SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER, ADMITTED ON THURSDAY TO A
CHANGE IN THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD THIS COUNTRY AND SAID THAT THE GEORGE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW "FAVORS" A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE WAR.

   MELENDEZ, WHO IS A STAFF MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN THE EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF MORAZAN, SAID ON
THE CLANDESTINE STATION RADIO VENCEREMOS THAT THE AMERICANS ARE MAKING
A FOREIGN POLICY CHANGE.

   "JONAS" TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, SAYING THAT "WE CAN NOW SAY
THAT THIS CHANGE ANNOUNCES THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS POLICY TODAY."

   "JUST AS THEY IMPOSED THE WAR, TODAY THEY ARE ALSO IMPOSING
CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL
SOLUTION," THE GUERRILLA LEADER SAID.

   A U.S. SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE VOTED FOR A CUT IN THE U.S. MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR AND LINKED ANOTHER CUT IN THE AID TO THE
PROGRESS MADE IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO END A WAR THAT HAS LASTED
A DECADE AND LEFT 72,000 PEOPLE KILLED.

   TO DEAL WITH THE CUT IN MILITARY AID, THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO
CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE SITUATION WOULD FORCE IT TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS
IN OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS HEALTH AND EDUCATION.

   IN THIS REGARD, "JONAS" SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WARNINGS ARE AIMED
AT MAINTAINING THE MILITARY STRUGGLE AT THE EXPENSE OF "SEVERELY
PUNISHING THE PEOPLE AND ALL LOWER-CLASS GROUPS."

   HOWEVER, MELENDEZ INSISTED THAT "THE MILITARY POLICY IN EL SALVADOR
IS WEAKENING...AND NEW CONDITIONS ARE BEING OPENED."  


DEV-MUC3-1266 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 4 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [ARMED
FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE, COPREFA] [TEXT] THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND
EMPHATICALLY REJECTS THE JUNIOR OFFICER'S STATEMENTS, CONSIDERED A
TYPE OF GRAY PROPOGANDA, BECAUSE NO PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS HAS
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.  THE STATEMENTS ARE BIASED IN FAVOR
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].

   ON 10 JANUARY 1981 A SERIES OF SIMILARLY ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND
STATEMENTS WERE CIRCULATED.  THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEARNED THAT
THE LETTERS WERE PART OF A STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED BY FORMER CAPTAIN
FRANCISCO SANDOVAL, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN
SUBVERSION.

   IN ADDITION, SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER 1989, BUT THIS
TIME IT WAS DONE BY A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS, WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMUNIQUE FROM
JUNIOR OFFICERS ON A NUMBER OF IRREGULARITIES THAT WERE REPORTEDLY
OCCURRING WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES.

   THE FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS LAUNCHED OFFENSIVES ON BOTH OCCASIONS.
ACCORDING TO THEIR GOALS, THE FINAL TASK WAS TO SEIZE POWER BY FORCE
AND BY ALL MEANS, EVEN IF THEY HAD TO SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF MANY
SALVADORAN CIVILIANS AND SEVERELY DAMAGE HOUSES AND THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

   THE ARMED FORCES ARE AWARE OF THEIR HIGH LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM
AND THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY AS DEMANDED BY THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC AND REITERATE THAT THEIR MISSION WILL
ALWAYS BE TO DEFEND THE NATION'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TO PROTECT EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INTERESTS.

   THEREFORE, IT IS USELESS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE ARMED FORCES'
MORALE AND TO CONFUSE AND DIVIDE ALL THE MEMBERS COMPRISING THE ARMED
FORCES THROUGH GROUNDLESS COMMUNIQUES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO CREATE
FALSE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC.


DEV-MUC3-1267 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH MNR'S
UNGO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] I HAVE
ANOTHER QUESTION.  A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE
MOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN
WHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS.  HE TERMED THEM
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO
YOU VIEW THIS?

   [UNGO] IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE
INTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID.  THE TIME AND
OPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT.  I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE
EFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM.  THERE IS ALWAYS THE
FAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT
IS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.  IF IT ACTS
MILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT
PEACE.  IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED
A SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES.  IT DOES NOT CEASE
TO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON
THE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE
CONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.  I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE
YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC,
THAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE
FACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A
PROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS
UPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE
FMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS.  THE DIALOGUE
AND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS.  I BELIEVE
THAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE.  IT
SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT
THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR
PERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT
ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL
FORCES AS WELL.

   [REPORTER] DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED
THROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3
MAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY.  DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS
BEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL
PERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS?

   [UNGO] I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS
DEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY, BUT I
THINK IT IS A DELAY THAT IMPROVES THE POSSIBILITIES AND CONDITIONS.
APPARENTLY THE TIMES WERE MARKED BY HASTE AND PRECIPITATION FOR THE
FMLN TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL.  ALSO, THERE WAS A VERY SHORT TIME FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE ITS RESPONSE AND HOLD A BILATERAL MEETING LATER.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT LEFT A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF INFLUENCE TO THE
POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HIMSELF CONVENED THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND HOW HE VIEWED THE ROLE OF
THE PARTIES.  THE PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF THEIR ROLE AND
HAVE BEEN WORKING ARDUOUSLY AND RESPONSIBLY.  IN TWO WEEKS THEY HELD
FOUR PROLONGED, HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS, TWO PER WEEK.  WE WANT TO DO THE
SAME THING WITH THE FMLN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PERIOD OF TWO TO THREE
WEEKS TO ONE MONTH, SINCE THE GENEVA AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, HAS BEEN
POSITIVE.  IF WE HAD HURRIED THINGS UP, PERHAPS THE POSSIBILITY OF
ACHIEVING RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ALL
OF THIS GIVES WAY TO SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC EVALUATIONS, BECAUSE THE
CONFIDENTIALITY WAS VIOLATED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT THESE THINGS ARE PART OF A PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL AIDE-MEMOIRE
THAT WAS AGREED TO IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE TWO TOP LEADERS OF THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE
CUELLAR'S REPRESENTATIVE.  [CONTINUED]

HAVE REPORTED THAT A GUATEMALAN CARGO PLANE OWNED BY THE TRASLADOS
COMPANY CRASHED THIS AFTERNOON ON TOP OF SEVERAL HOUSES IN NORTHERN
GUATEMALA CITY, CAUSING AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED.

   CIVIL AERONAUTICS PERSONNEL CONFIRMED TO ACAN - EFE THAT THE THREE
CREW MEMBERS OF THE DC-6 WERE U.S. CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN HIRED TO FLY
THE PLANE TO MIAMI.

   SOURCES FROM THE MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THE PLANE DESTROYED
12 HOUSES.  THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS, THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED SHORTLY
AFTER THE PLANE TOOK OFF FROM THE LA AURORA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AND
APPARENTLY WAS DUE TO THE LOSS OF AN ENGINE.

   FIRE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN HAROLDO JUAREZ SAID THERE HAVE BEEN
EXPLOSIONS IN THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE GASES THAT HAD
ACCUMULATED FROM THE FUEL SPILLED BY THE PLANE.

   ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN, THE PILOT TRIED TO LAND ON AN EMPTY LOT
BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CRASHED IN THE HOUSING AREA.

   JUAREZ SAID THE EXACT NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED IS UNKNOWN BUT
UNOFFICIALLY THERE ARE REPORTS OF 15 DEAD AND MORE THAN 20 INJURED.

THE CAPITAL WHEN A CARGO PLANE THAT HAD JUST TAKEN OFF FROM THE LA
AURORA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CRASHED INTO A RESIDENTIAL AREA
DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES AND KILLING 17 PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN.

   A SECOND ACCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN A SMALL PLANE HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY LANDING IN RABINAL, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.  IN
THIS ACCIDENT THE PILOT WAS INJURED.

   IN A THIRD ACCIDENT, A PLANE THAT HAD MANEUVERED ON THE RUNWAY OF
THE LA AURORA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TURNED OVER AND CRASHED.  THE
PLANE WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED AND THE PILOT AND MEMBERS OF THE CREW WERE
INJURED.

   IN A FOURTH ACCIDENT, A HELICOPTER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL STAFF HAD
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

   DETAILS OF THE LAST THREE ACCIDENTS WERE NOT YET KNOWN.  THESE
ACCIDENTS HAVE MADE THIS THE WORST DAY FOR GUATEMALAN AVIATION IN

   GUATEMALA CITY, 30 APR 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] THE MUTUAL SUPPORT GROUP
(GAM) HAS REPORTED FINDING 25 CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES IN THE COUNTRY'S
WESTERN HIGH PLATEAU AREA, NOTING THAT PROCEEDINGS REQUIRED FOR AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE CEMETERIES HAVE BEGUN.

   ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, MOST OF THE
CEMETERIES ARE IN HAMLETS AND COMMUNITIES LOCATED IN THE GUATEMALAN
HIGH PLATEAU, AN AREA THAT SUFFERED A GREAT AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE DURING
THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1979 AND 1982.  THE PRESIDENT SAID: "THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE BURIED IN THESE HIDDEN CEMETERIES WERE RELATIVES OF SOME OF
THE PEOPLE WHO BELONG TO OUR HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION."

   GAM PRESIDENT NINETH DE GARCIA ADDED: "ALL THE CRIMES WERE
COMMITTED BY MEN WHO HIDE IN ANONYMITY AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
KIDNAPPING AND DISAPPEARANCES IN OUR COUNTRY."

   OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, GAM HAS INTENSIFIED ITS SEARCH FOR
CLANDESTINE CEMETERIES AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL: THREE CEMETERIES WERE
FOUND IN EL QUICHE, ONE IN CHIMALTENANGO, ONE IN SACATEPEQUEZ, AND ONE
FOUND IN CHINAUTLA LAST YEAR.

   "OUR ACTIVISTS IN THE GUATEMALAN HIGH PLATEAU AREA HAVE REPORTED
SEVERAL TIMES TO OUR HEADQUARTERS THAT CHUPOL'CIVIL PATROL GUARDS HAVE
KIDNAPPED THEIR RELATIVES, THAT TWO CEMETERIES EXIST IN THAT
COMMUNITY, AND THAT OTHER CEMETERIES ARE LOCATED IN USPANTAN, EL
QUICHE, ZACUALPA, AND THE REST OF THE MUNICIPALITIES IN THIS AREA,"
SHE SAID.

   "THERE ARE MORE THAN 100 CEMETERIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED
TO THE EL QUICHE 2D PENAL COURT AND PENDING AN INVESTIGATION.
HOWEVER, THIS COURT HAS NOT ISSUED THE REQUIRED EXHUMATION ORDERS FOR
THE INVESTIGATIONS TO CONTINUE; THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE DELIBERATELY
SHELVED THE CHARGES WE PRESENTED AT THE COURTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY REFUSE
TO CARRY OUT THE REQUIRED LEGAL PROCEDURES," SAID THE GAM PRESIDENT.

   NINETH DE GARCIA STATED: "THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO HAVE
DISAPPEARED, REQUEST THAT THE KIDNAPPERS AND MURDERERS OF OUR
RELATIVES BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND PUNISHED.  IN A MONTH'S TIME, OUR
FOUNDATION WILL HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR SIX YEARS AND, UP TO NOW,
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS REFUSED TO FORM A COMMISSION TO
INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THE 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED."

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ALBERTO FUJIMORI ESCAPED A DYNAMITE ATTACK
PERPETRATED BY A SHINING PATH CELL ON 6 MAY.  ACCORDING TO THE POLICE,
THE DYNAMITE CHARGE WAS DETONATED ON THE ROUTE FOLLOWED BY FUJIMORI'S
MOTORCADE IN THE DISTRICT CAPITAL OF SAN JUAN DE LURIGANCHO.

   THE ATTACKERS LEFT FLIERS IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS MEMBERS OF THE
MOVEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE'S DEFENSE, A SHINING PATH FRONT ORGANIZATION.
DORA VILCHEZ, A 26-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, WAS INJURED IN THE ATTACK.

   FUJIMORI, WHO WILL CONTEND WITH WRITER MARIO VARGAS LLOSA IN A
RUNOFF ELECTION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF JUNE, WAS ONLY INFORMED OF
THE ATTACK BY HIS AIDES AFTER THE POLICE HAD TIGHTENED THEIR SECURITY
AROUND HIM.  THE "CHANGE 90" LEADER MINIMIZED THE ATTACK AND CONTINUED
HIS SCHEDULED ACTIVITIES.

   THE POLICE SAID THAT A SHINING PATH GROUP MANAGED TO INFILTRATE A
CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AND SET OFF THE DYNAMITE CHARGE ON THE ROUTE
FOLLOWED BY FUJIMORI'S MOTORCADE, NEAR A LOCAL MARKET, ON THE EASTERN
SIDE OF LIMA.

   VILCHEZ, WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS HOSPITALIZED.

   THE BOMB SQUAD UNIT (UDE) DEFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICE NEAR THE
MARKET.

   THE FLIERS DISSEMINATED BY THE TERRORISTS URGED THE PEOPLE NOT TO
VOTE IN THE RUNOFF ELECTION.  ONE OF THE FLIERS SAID: "NEITHER
FUJIMORI NOR VARGAS LLOSA IS THE SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY BOTH REPRESENT
THE RIGHT WING.  LONG LIVE THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  PCP.SL."

MINISTER COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA.

   "THESE CHANGES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE CONCERTED CEASE-FIRE
PROCESS, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENTS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION
WHILE IMPUNITY PREVAILS IN THE ARMY AND IT IS NOT SUBJECTED TO A
THOROUGH PURGE," THE FMLN ADDED.

   GEN LARIOS TOLD NEWSMEN YESTERDAY ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT BY
COL EMILIO PONCE IN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS A CHANGE WHICH HE REGARDED
AS "NATURAL."

   "EVENTUALLY THERE MAY BE A CHANGE OF THAT SORT.  IT IS A NATURAL
AND ROUTINE CHANGE," THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT
PERSISTENT RUMORS TO THIS EFFECT IN THAT PAST FEW DAYS IN EL SALVADOR.

   COL PONCE, A MEMBER OF THE 1966 GRADUATION CLASS KNOWN AS "LA
TANDONA," CURRENTLY HAS GREAT INFLUENCE AMONG THE ARMED FORCES
OFFICERS. HE HAS HELD THE POST OF CHIEF OF STAFF SINCE THE MIDDLE OF
LAST YEAR.

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE STATED THAT PONCE'S REMOVAL FROM THE POST OF
CHIEF OF STATE "WOULD BREAK THE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS."  THE JESUIT
PRIESTS WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY ALLEGED ARMED FORCES
MEMBERS, WHO WERE TURNED OVER TO JUDICIARY AUTHORITIES.

ASSURANCES OF HIS DEEP RESPECT FOR THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT, AND
EXPLAINED HE MAY HAVE USED IMPROPER LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF HIS LESS THAN
FLUENT SPANISH.  HE SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOW RESOLVED.  THE PLO OFFICIAL
FARUQ QADDUMI VISITED CHILE LAST WEEK, AND MET WITH SEVERAL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.

TO CAPTAIN JOSE ALFONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA, A WORTHY EXAMPLE OF DEVOTION TO
SERVICE TO THE FATHERLAND.  HIS MEMORY WILL ALWAYS BE A SOURCE OF
INSPIRATION TO EVERY SALVADORAN SOLDIER WHO IS FIGHTING FOR OUR
PEOPLE'S FREEDOM AND GLORY.  AS OF TODAY, THE SPECIAL ANTI- TERRORIST
COMMANDO, CEAT, WILL BEAR CAPT CHAVEZ' NAME IN JUST RECOGNITION OF HIS

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 MAY 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A QUAKE MEASURING FOUR
DEGREES ON THE RICHTER SCALE ROCKED THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY AT
1008 LOCAL (1608 GMT), BUT THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF INJURIES OR
PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   A SPOKESMAN FROM THE SEISMOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF EL SALVADOR SAID THE
EPICENTER WAS LOCATED SOME 115 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL,
IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN, AT A DEPTH OF 50 KM.

   THE SOURCE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT SO FAR THIS MONTH 78 TREMORS HAVE
BEEN RECORDED IN EL SALVADOR, BUT ONLY TODAY'S QUAKE WAS FELT BY THE
POPULATION.

   THE SERIES OF QUAKES IS THE RESULT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE
"COCO" AND THE "CARIBBEAN" PLATES, THE SPOKESMAN ADDED.  HE SAID THE
MOVEMENT WAS "NORMAL."

   IN OCTOBER 1986, AN EARTHQUAKE DESTROYED A LARGE SECTION OF THE
SALVADORAN CAPITAL AND NEARLY 1,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

ECUADORAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER CORDOVEZ, MADAME CORDOVEZ, AND FOUR
OTHER ECUADORAN OFFICIALS ARRIVED IN LLASA ON THE MORNING OF 5 MAY.

   AT 1830 THE SAME DAY, PUQUANG, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TIBET
AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT, MET WITH THE ECUADORAN
VISITORS AT THE TIBETAN-STYLE MEETING ROOM AT THE HOLIDAY INN IN
LHASA.  IN A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG BRIEFED
FOREIGN MINISTER CORDOVEZ ON TIBET'S AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,
INDUSTRY, ENERGY, AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND ESPECIALLY THE SUCCESSES
TIBET HAS ACHIEVED IN VARIOUS FIELDS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT SINCE TIBET'S DEMOCRATIC REFORM.

   ON BEHALF OF THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT,
VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG PRESENTED GIFTS TO THE VISITORS.  THEN, VICE
CHAIRMAN PUQUANG HOSTED A DINNER IN HONOR OF THE ECUADORAN VISITORS.

   MAKING HIS WELCOMING SPEECH, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG SAID: YOUR
EXCELLENCY MINISTER CORDOVEZ HAS VISITED CHINA MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE
CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS
BETWEEN CHINA AND ECUADOR AND THE PEOPLES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.  YOUR
EXCELLENCY'S CURRENT VISIT TO TIBET WILL CERTAINLY ENABLE YOU TO
UNDERSTAND CHINA BETTER.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG STRESSED: TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHINA'S
SACRED TERRITORY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 13TH CENTURY.  IT IS A FACT
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WHOLE WORLD THAT ALL PREVIOUS CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS
EFFECTIVELY EXERCISED THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN TIBET.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG ALSO SAID THAT, SINCE THE LIFTING THE MARTIAL
LAW ORDER IN LHASA, TIBET'S SITUATION HAS BEEN STABLE, ITS PUBLIC

MINISTER CORDOVEZ SAID: VISITING THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGION HAS
BEEN MY DREAM FOR MANY YEARS.  LIKE TIBET, ECUADOR IS A COUNTRY ON A
PLATEAU.  WHEN I SET FOOT IN BEAUTIFUL LHASA, I HAD THE FEELING THAT I
HAD RETURNED TO MY HOMETOWN.

   MINISTER CORDOVEZ WHOLEHEARTEDLY WISHED TIBET PROSPERITY IN ALL
FIELDS AND THE TIBETAN PEOPLE HAPPINESS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [JULIO
ERNESTO RODRIGUEZ] [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO
LARIOS STATED TODAY THAT THE OFFICERS WHO COULD SERVE AS WITNESSES IN
THE CASE OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ASSASSINATED AT THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY ARE TAKING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD.  HE DENIED THE
OFFICERS LEFT FOR REASONS OTHER FOR THE STRICTLY MILITARY NEED OF
TRAINING.  IF THE JUDGE SO ASKS FOR IT, THEY MAY RETURN TO GIVE THEIR
STATEMENT ON THE JESUITS' CASE, HE SAID.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE LOSS OF
THE REGISTRY RECORDING THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE OF PERSONS FROM THE
MILITARY ACADEMY, GEN. LARIOS SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] THE CADETS ARE NOW OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  THIS
IS IN LINE WITH A PROGRAM PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE.  CADETS OF CERTAIN CLASSES
LEAVE TO CONDUCT STUDIES, CHIEFLY IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS NORMAL, AS
IT CORRESPONDS TO A SCHEDULED PLAN.  THEY WILL HAVE TO RETURN AT SOME POINT
WHEN THEY CONCLUDE THEIR STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  THEN WE WILL HAVE
THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY ANY ASPECT OF THIS MATTER.

   [REPORTER] COULD NOT THE JUDGE CALL THEM EARLIER?

   [LARIOS] IF THE JUDGE DEEMS THEIR PRESENCE ADVISABLE, THEY MAY BE
CALLED IMMEDIATELY.

   [REPORTER] REFERRING TO THE ENTRY AND DEPARTURE REGISTRY OF THE
DAY WHEN THE JESUITS WERE KILLED, HOW WILL THIS SITUATION END UP?

   [LARIOS] SO FAR, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THE MATTER.  I AM NOT AWARE
OF THE SITUATION.  WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS FEELS THAT THE JESUITS' CASE HAS HAD A GREAT BEARING ON
THE CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE MILITARY AID THE U.S. SENATE WILL
APPROVE.  THE MILITARY CHIEF REGRETTED IT IS NOT UP TO THE SALVADORAN
ARMY TO SAY WHEN THE AID MUST BE CUT.  THE U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE THEIR
MEANS AND CRITERIA TO DECIDE WHEN TO CUT AID, HE SAID REFERRING TO THE
DECISION BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  THE U.S.  ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID IT
WILL CUT MILITARY AID BY 50 PERCENT IF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT TRY THE PERSONS GUILTY OF MURDERING SIX JESUITS AND TWO OTHERS.
THE AID WILL BE CUT IF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TRY TO OBTAIN
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GUERRILLAS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] WE ALL KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN REGARDING THE
MILITARY AID.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE MUST ADMIT WE CANNOT DECIDE THE TERMS UNDER
WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE THAT MILITARY AID.  THEY MUST DO THAT.  THEY WILL
DECIDE WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THAT AID WILL BE CUT.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THAT THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM IN
WHICH COL.OCHOA PEREZ PARTICIPATED WAS INFLUENTIAL IN THE DECISION TO
ASK THE THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CUT THE AID?

   [LARIOS] I THINK THAT IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN INFLUENTIAL.  WE MUST
UNDOUBTEDLY RECOGNIZE THIS.  NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS NOT ALL.  I BELIEVE
THAT THE SITUATION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM WAS
BROADCAST.  THEREFORE, I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED REGARDLESS
OF WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE 60 MINUTES PROGRAM, AND WE WERE [WORDS
INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WHAT WERE THE ISSUES WHICH HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THIS?
WHAT COULD THEY BE?

   [LARIOS] THAT IS REALLY NOTHING NEW.  THE JESUITS' CASE HAS BEEN,
LET US SAY, THE DECISIVE FACTOR FOR DECIDING ONE THING OR ANOTHER IN
THE U.S. CONGRESS, SENATE, AND ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE MILITARY AID.
THAT IS BASICALLY THE ISSUE. [END RECORDING]

   GEN. LARIOS ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CHANGES WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN
THE ARMY LEADERSHIP.  RECENT RUMORS INDICATE THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS
POST AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND THAT CHANGES MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.  HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THESE CHANGES MAY OCCUR, BUT HE TERMED THEM AS
ROUTINE.

   REFERRING TO A U.S. TELEVISION PROGRAM WHICH IMPLIED COLONEL
ORLANDO ZEPEDA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE JESUITS' CASE, THE DEFENSE
MINISTER SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THE
DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER IS A COLLEAGUE WHO ONLY HANDLES ADMINISTRATIVE
ISSUES WITHIN THE ARMY.

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] ACTING ON INFORMATION OBTAINED DURING
QUESTIONING OF POLICEMEN INVOLVED IN THE LOCAL COCAINE TRADE, BRAZILIAN
POLICE AGENTS SEIZED A LAB IN WESTERN MATO GROSSO DO SUL STATE IN EARLY
APRIL.  IN ADDITION, BROADCASTS AIRED IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF CORUMBA
DENOUNCING THE DRUG PROBLEM AND POLICE INVOLVEMENT HAVE MADE A LOCAL RADIO
STATION A TARGET OF BOMB THREATS FROM NARCOTRAFFICKERS, ACCORDING TO REPORTS
IN THE BRAZILIAN PRESS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, PRESIDENT FERNANDO COLLOR DE MELLO
HAS LAUNCHED AN ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN.

   ON 7 APRIL FEDERAL POLICE OF MATO GROSSO DO SUL STATE RAIDED A
WELL-EQUIPPED COCAINE REFINING LABORATORY ON A RANCH IN AQUIDAUANA,
THE RIO DE JANEIRO DAILY O GLOBO OF 8 APRIL REPORTS.  THE LAB WAS THE
FIFTH UNCOVERED IN THE STATE IN THE LAST 14 MONTHS.  AGENTS SEIZED 50
KILOS OF PROCESSED COCAINE, ONE OF THE LARGEST SEIZURES IN BRAZIL THIS
YEAR, AND MORE THAN 100 LITERS OF ETHER AND ACETONE.  TWENTY HEAVILY
ARMED TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED.  WITH INADEQUATE POLICE STRENGTH AND
BORDERING BOTH BOLIVIA AND PARAGUAY, THE STATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF
THE MAIN ROUTES FOR THE DRUG RINGS THAT SUPPLY COCAINE TO BRAZIL'S
PRINCIPAL URBAN CENTERS, PARTICULARLY RIO AND SAO PAULO.  THE
TRAFFICKERS ALSO HAVE CONNECTIONS ABROAD.

   THE LABORATORY IN AQUIDAUANA WAS DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF THE
RECENT ARREST OF EIGHT CIVILIAN POLICE DETECTIVES, TWO FEDERAL
POLICEMEN, AND FOUR HIGHWAY POLICEMEN INVOLVED IN A NARCOTICS RING,
CONTINUES O GLOBO.  DURING QUESTIONING, THEY PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT
LED TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE RING, INCLUDING A BOLIVIAN CHEMIST IN
AQUIDAUANA.  THE RING WAS HEADED BY A MATO GROSSO DO SUL BUSINESSMAN
AND A POLITICIAN WHO FINANCED THE TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDED
COVER; NEITHER MAN WAS IDENTIFIED BY NAME IN THE REPORT.  ACCORDING TO
FEDERAL AGENTS, THE COCAINE PASTE WAS BROUGHT FROM BOLIVIA BY
FISHERMEN AND CANOERS HIRED ON THE BRAZILIAN- BOLIVIAN BORDER, AND WAS
PROCESSED AND DISTRIBUTED IN AQUIDAUANA.

   O GLOBO TERMS THE RAID A "REAL CLEAN-UP" IN THE CIVILIAN, MILITARY,
AND FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.  THE FIRST SUCH ACTION WAS TAKEN IN
LATE 1989 WHEN FEDERAL POLICE ARRESTED 22 POLICEMEN.  O GLOBO OF 2
APRIL CITES THE ARREST OF SIX MILITARY POLICEMEN CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF
DISTRIBUTING COCAINE IN CAMPO GRANDE, MATO GROSSO DO SUL STATE, ADDING
THAT THE RING INCLUDED MORE THAN 20 MILITARY POLICEMEN.  THE
RINGLEADER WAS OLDINEY FREIRE, AN ATTORNEY ARRESTED IN MARCH 1989 AND
A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF RANCHER CAMBARALAMAIA DE SOUSA.  PRIOR TO HIS
ARREST IN JUNE 1988, CAMBARALAMAIA CONTROLLED COCAINE TRAFFICKING IN A
LARGE PORTION OF MATO GROSSO USING THE COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA ROUTE.  HE
ALSO SUPPLIED 300 KILOS OF PURE COCAINE MONTHLY TO SAO PAULO, RIO DE
JANEIRO, AND ESPIRITO SANTO.

   RIO DE JANEIRO DAILY JORNAL DO BRASIL NOTES ON 17 APRIL THAT THE
FEDERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT (DPF) IS INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT FEDERAL
POLICE ARE INVOLVED IN DRUG SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING IN CORUMBA AND
LADARIO.  TRAFFICKING IN THE REGION HAS INCREASED STEADILY IN RECENT
YEARS DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO BOLIVIAN TOWNS INCLUDED IN THE ROUTE
USED BY INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING RINGS, ACCORDING TO THE PAPER.
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FEDERAL
POLICE IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, DPF LEGAL COORDINATOR MARIO CASSIANO
DUTRA SAID THAT IN FEBRUARY ALONE, FOUR INVESTIGATIONS WERE OPENED
INTO CHARGES OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG AND ARMS TRAFFICKING AND
BRIBERY, AN ADDITIONAL 12 WERE CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS, AND ANOTHER FIVE
ONLY NEEDED DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO BE CONCLUDED.

   TO COMBAT THE GROWING NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF
CORUMBA, ON 11 APRIL LOCAL STATION RADIO CLUBE DE CORUMBA LAUNCHED AN
ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN.  IT DEVOTED AN HOUR OF ITS REGULAR PROGRAM "PUBLIC
DEBATE" TO AN EXPOSE OF DRUG DISTRIBUTION POINTS IN THE CITY AND THE
COMPLICITY OF FEDERAL POLICE, MILITARY POLICE, AND CIVILIAN POLICE
INVESTIGATORS WITH NARCOTRAFFICKERS.  ACCORDING TO O GLOBO OF 12
APRIL, PROGRAM MODERATOR ARMANDO AMORIM ANACHE IDENTIFIED 21 COCAINE
DISTRIBUTION POINTS AS WELL AS POLICEMEN AND THE TRAFFICKERS WHO
SUPPLIED THEM IN EXCHANGE FOR PROTECTION.

   AFTER THE PROGRAM, ANACHE RECEIVED FOUR THREATENING PHONE CALLS,
INCLUDING A BOMB THREAT AGAINST THE BUILDING HOUSING THE RADIO
STATION, O GLOBO OF 14 APRIL REPORTS.  HE RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC
SUPPORT WHEN HE BROADCAST THOSE THREATS. RADIO CLUBE RECEIVED LETTERS
ALERTING POLICE TO THE USE OF CHILDREN WHO PICK UP DRUGS FROM BOLIVIAN
WOMEN AT THE RAILROAD STATION.  A MOTHERS' PROTEST PARADE WAS PLANNED,
AND 850 LOCAL BUSINESSMEN RESOLVED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS FOR ONE DAY AS
A SYMBOLIC PROTEST AGAINST THE TRAFFICKING SITUATION IN CORUMBA.  ON
18 APRIL, THE STATION RECEIVED SIX BOMB THREATS FROM COCAINE
TRAFFICKERS WHO ALSO THREATENED TO BOMB ITS SISTER STATION RADIO
INDEPENDENTE DE AQUIDAUANA, O GLOBO OF 19 APRIL REPORTS.

   WEARING A YELLOW T-SHIRT WITH THE SLOGAN "DRUGS: OUT OF HERE,"
PRESIDENT FERNANDO COLLOR DE MELLO LAUNCHED AN ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN, O
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO OF 29 APRIL REPORTED IN A FRONT-PAGE PHOTO WITH
ACCOMPANYING INSIDE-PAGE ARTICLE.  COLLOR THEN DONATED THE T-SHIRT TO

   BOGOTA, 10 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN SUPREME COURT TODAY
DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE REGISTRATION OF FIVE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES FOR THE UPCOMING 27 MAY ELECTIONS.

   THE MEASURE ESPECIALLY AFFECTS ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, CANDIDATE OF
THE FORMER 19 APRIL (M-19) GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHO REPLACED CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO WAS ASSASSINATED LAST MONTH WHILE HE WAS
ABOARD A FLIGHT, AS M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS PRONOUNCED ITSELF ON THE DECREES AND
LAWS PROMULGATED BY THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES, DECLARED
UNCONSTITUTIONAL A DECREE ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS WHICH ELIMINATED THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PERSONS
TO REGISTER AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDDIDATES. THE DECREE WAS ISSUED UNDER
THE STATE OF SIEGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS.

   THE GOVERNMENT DECREE WAS ISSUED TO FAVOR PIZARRO LEON-GOMEZ, WHO
ENTERED THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AFTER A PEACE PROCESS WHEREBY THE M-19
DEMOBILIZED AND ABANDONED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.

   ALSO AFFECTED ARE CANDIDATES GUILLERMO ALEMAN, POPULAR SINGER AND
CUMBIA COMPOSER MARIO GARENA, JAIRO RODRIGUEZ LEON, AND HENRY FARFAN
SILVA, WHO HAD ALREADY RESIGNED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEM HAD ANY CHANCE
OF WINNING.

   ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE STATE OF SIEGE MUST ONLY BE
CONSIDERED WHEN ISSUING DECREES DEALING WITH THE RESTORING OF PUBLIC
ORDER, WHICH DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE COLOMBIAN LAWS DEMAND THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE OR
HAS BEEN A PARLIAMENTARIAN, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, AMBASSADOR, OR
ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.

   NONETHELESS, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IS NOT RETROACTIVE AND
THE CANDIDACIES WILL BE WITHDRAWN ONLY IF THEY ARE OFFICIALLY
CHALLENGED.

EMBASSY SALUTES THE HONORABLE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND IN REFERENCE TO
NOTE NO. A.J.122 FROM THAT MINISTRY IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
HAVE DULY ACKNOWLEDGED NOTE DPG 1794 OF 30 APRIL 1990 FROM THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THROUGH WHICH THIS EMBASSY HAS BEEN
INFORMED THAT OUR REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA IS ACCUSED OF BEING
THE MASTERMIND OF CHILD MARCOS ALBERTO RODRIGUEZ JUSTINES' MURDER
ACCORDING TO CANCIO CIACCI TASON'S STATEMENTS.

   IN THIS REGARD, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY REITERATES THAT, THROUGH NOTE
NO.5-20-M/002 DATED 8 JANUARY 1990, IT NOTIFIED THE PANAMANIAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY THAT DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM HAD BEEN GRANTED TO 12 PERSONS WHO
CAME TO THIS MISSION'S RESIDENCE, INCLUDING FORMER DEFENSE FORCES
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ RIVERA, AND REQUESTED THAT SAFE-CONDUCTS BE
GRANTED FOR THEM TO TRAVEL ABROAD.  WE MIGHT STRESS THAT SUCH GRANTING
OF ASYLUM AND REQUESTING SAFE-CONDUCTS, AS WAS INDICATED IN THIS
EMBASSY'S NOTE NO.5-20-/M-027 DATED 2 MARCH 1990, WAS BASED ON THE
QUALIFICATION GRANTED TO THIS EMBASSY AS THE STATE GRANTING THE ASYLUM
ACCORDING TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS IN
MARCH 1954.  THEREFORE, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION ANY ACTIONS OF WHICH THE REFUGEE MAY BE ACCUSED, OR ANY
LEGAL SITUATION THAT MAY PREVAIL AFTER THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN GRANTED
ASYLUM.

   HOWEVER, AND WITHOUT GOING AGAINST WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED,
THE REFUGEE GONZALO GONZALEZ IS WILLING TO RENDER TESTIMONY BEFORE AN
AUTHORIZED LEGAL OFFICIAL SO AS TO CLARIFY HIS SITUATION.  THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY WILL ALLOW THAT OFFICIAL TO ENTER THE PREMISES OF THE
EMBASSY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   AT THIS TIME, THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, BASED ON THE CLEAR DISPOSITIONS
OF THE CARACAS CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM -- THE INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENT IN EFFECT BETWEEN PANAMA AND PERU -- REITERATES ONCE AGAIN
THE REQUEST FOR A SAFE-CONDUCT FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED REFUGEE.

   THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AVAILS ITSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REAFFIRM
ITS HIGHEST AND MOST DISTINGUISHED CONSIDERATION TO THE HONORABLE
FOREIGN MINISTRY.

DRUG DEALERS. THE PROBE, SAID CANARADIO, WILL BEGIN IN TWO MONTHS.

   IN IDENTIFYING THE BRITON TO HEAD THE INVESTIGATION, THE CABINET

   ISRAEL SAYS IT SOLD THE ARMS TO THE ANTIGUA GOVERNMENT, BUT ST.
JOHN'S DENIES THIS. THE ISRAELIS HAVE IMPLICATED AN ANTIGUAN MINISTER,
VERE BIRD JR. IN THE SCANDAL, BUT BIRD SAYS HE HAD NO LINKS WITH THE
ARMS.

   MEANWHILE, ISRAEL ON SUNDAY CALLED COLOMBIAN DIPLOMATIC SANCTIONS
OVER THE SALES OF ISRAELI ARMS TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNJUSTIFIED AND
SAID IT WAS WORKING TO END THE ROW. AFTER COLOMBIAN POLICE FOUND
HUNDREDS OF ISRAELI-MADE GUNS ON THE FARM OF A DEAD DRUG BARON, BOGOTA
SAID ON FRIDAY IT WAS REVOKING 1962 AND 1966 AGREEMENTS ALLOWING
ISRAELIS TO VISIT WITHOUT VISAS.

NEITHER RIGHT NOR JUSTIFIED. WE WILL REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH THE
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE," AN ISRAELI
FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN TOLD REUTERS.

   BOGOTA HAS ALSO ACCUSED ISRAELI AND BRITISH MERCENARIES OF HELPING
DRUG TRAFFICKERS TRAIN PRIVATE ARMIES BLAMED FOR KILLING CIVILIANS IN

   PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE GROUP THAT REBELLED
ON 17 MAY 1980 HAS DEVISED "A CELEBRATIONS PLAN" AND THAT IT INTENDS
TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AS "A SIGN OF VICTORY" IN THE "STRUGGLE OF
MOVEMENTS," AN IDEOLOGY INSPIRED IN MAO ZEDONG'S DOCTRINE.

   ARMY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS SINCE THE NIGHT OF 12
MAY AND HAVE ALREADY PARTICIPATED ON JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE POLICE
TO ARREST 500 ALLEGED TERRORISTS.

   IN LIMA, 8,000 POLICE AGENTS AND A SPECIAL ANTIEXPLOSIVES SQUAD
LAUNCHED "A GIGANTIC OPERATION" OF "BLOCKADES AND SATURATION."

   A POLICE SPOKESMAN TOLD EFE THAT THEY HAD ORDERS "TO CAREFULLY COMB
THE NEW URBAN AREAS AND SEARCH FOR SUSPECTED CRIMINALS, ARMS,
EXPLOSIVES, OR SUBVERSIVE MATERIAL."

   ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN, THE LIMA POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADED BY
GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ HAS ORDERS "TO WATCH ROADS ENTERING THE CITY, TO
INSTALL EMERGENCY CHECK POINTS IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS, AND TO REPORT
ON ANYTHING UNUSUAL."

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES, THE OPERATION WILL CONTINUE UNTIL
AFTER THE RUNOFF ELECTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE HELD ON 10 JUNE.

   THE POLICE HAVE LAUNCHED SIMILAR OPERATIONS IN REGIONS WHERE
GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS RAMPANT SUCH AS AYACUCHO, PUNO, HUANCAYO, AND
HUANCAVELICA IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THESE REGIONS ARE ALL
UNDER STATES OF EMERGENCY AND UNDER MILITARY CONTROL.

   SHINING PATH, CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPENETRABLE AND ORTHODOX
ARMED MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA, BEGAN CELEBRATING ITS ANNIVERSARY IN
LIMA LAST WEEK BY BURNING 11 STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY BUSES. THE BUSES
WERE ATTACKED BY HOODED INDIVIDUALS THOUGHT TO BE SHINING PATH
MILITANTS.

   ON 11 MAY A BOMB DESTROYED A BUILDING OWNED BY THE FAMILY OF THE
MAYOR OF LIMA.  IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN LIMA TODAY, POLICE CORPORAL
OSWALDO PALOMINO, WHO SERVED IN AYACUCHO UNTIL A SHORT TIME AGO, WAS
SHOT TO DEATH.

   IN AYACUCHO, WHERE THE THE COMUNIST PARTY OF PERU -- "OFFICIAL"
NAME OF SHINING PATH -- WAS BORN AND DEVELOPED, TWO PEOPLE WERE
MURDERED, AND VARIOUS HOME-MADE BOMBS EXPLODED IN IN THE LAST 24
HOURS.

   COUNCILMEN JUAN MANUEL GARABITO FROM PIURA, 1,100 KM NORTH OF LIMA,
HAS ALSO BEEN SHOT TO DEATH. AUTHORITIES BLAMED SHINING PATH FOR THESE
ATTACKS.

   OBSERVERS OF THE PERUVIAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TOLD EFE THAT THE
GROWING TIDE OF VIOLENCE ATTIBUTED TO SHINING PATH INDICATES THAT THE
RADICAL, OR "RED" SECTOR, OF THE REBEL GROUP HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THE
ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, TWO DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION CLASHED OVER THE CELEBRATION OF THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY:
THE YOUNGER AND RADICAL SECTORS FAVORED PURELY MILITARY OPERATIONS
WHILE THE OLDER SECTOR, OR "BLACKS," FAVORED MORE POLITICAL AND
HISTORIC ACTIVITIES.

   SHINING PATH, WHICH OFFICIALLY OPERATES WITH APPROXIMATELY 5,000
ARMED MEN, HAS CAUSED THE DEATH OF 20,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 7,000
CIVILIANS, AND IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR $17 BILLION IN DIRECT DAMAGES TO
THE COUNTRY OVER ITS 10 YEAR HISTORY.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT SOURCES
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THREE POLICEMEN FROM THE GUATEMALA POLICE
IDENTIFICATION DEPARTMENT WERE KILLED BY GUERRILLAS OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   POLICE SPOKESMEN SAID THAT POLICEMEN HUMBERTO DIAZ, A DRIVER; EDGAR
CORONADO, A PHOTOGRAPHER; AND MARIO NAVARRO, A TECHNICAL SERGEANT,
WERE AMBUSHED LAST NIGHT BY GUERRILLAS AT THE SAN ISIDRO FARM, 99 KM
SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL.

   THE POLICEMEN WERE ON THE WAY BACK FROM INVESTIGATING THE BURNING
OF FIVE BUSES BY REBELS LAST WEEK AND WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED BY
GUERRILLAS FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS
(ORPA).

   MEANWHILE, AMALIO ESCOBAR MONZON, 21, A MEMBER OF THE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE
PATROLS (PAC), WAS SHOT TO DEATH IN SAN PABLO, SAN MARCOS DEPARTMENT, IN THE
NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.

   OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT YESTERDAY ARMED MEN BROKE INTO MONZON'S
RESIDENCE AND KILLED HIM.

   IN SOLOLA DEPARTMENT, ALSO IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY,
OTHER INSURGENT GROUPS OCCUPIED STRETCHES OF HIGHWAY AND DEMANDED THAT
TRAVELERS SURRENDER THEIR MONEY AND BELONGINGS.

   THESE INSURGENT ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THE DIALOGUE THAT WILL BE HELD IN SPAIN BETWEEN GUERRILLA DELEGATES
AND THE GUATEMALAN POLITICAL PARTIES TO AGREE ON A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE
AND TO END 30 YEARS OF INTERNAL STRIFE.

   THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG), WHICH INCLUDES
THE ORPA AND OTHER INSURGENT MOVEMENTS, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS BUT IN THE MEANTIME WILL CONTINUE ITS ARMED
STRUGGLE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 16 MAY 90 (TELEONCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] TERRORIST
ACTIONS WERE REPORTED TONIGHT SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, A FEW HOURS AFTER A
MASS TRANSIT BUS AND SEVERAL TIRES WERE BURNED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.
TWO EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE IN A VACANT LOT AT APPROXIMATELY 2120 ON 15TH
AVENUE AND 6TH STREET, ZONE 13.  ACCORDING TO PERSONS WHO WERE NEARBY AT
THAT TIME, SHOOTING WAS HEARD BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS. A FEW MINUTES LATER,
DEVICES, BELIEVED TO BE FRAGMENTATION GRENADES, WENT OFF.  THE SHOCK WAVE
CREATED BY THE BLAST SHATTERED THE WINDOWS OF HOUSE NUMBER 729 AND BUILDING
626, LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE VACANT LOT.  THE EXPLOSION PROMPTED THE QUICK
MOBILIZATION OF FIREMEN, POLICEMEN, AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIERS FROM LA AURORA MILITARY BASE.

   SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL ORANGE EXPLOSIVE SQUAD [UNIDAD
NARANJA ESPECIAL DE LUCHA ANTIEXPLOSIVOS] ALSO ARRIVED TO DEFUSE
ANOTHER DEVICE LEFT IN THE AREA.  AT FIRST, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE
HOME CLOSE TO THE SITE OF THE EXPLOSION BELONGEDTO NEWSMAN ALVARO
CONTRERAS VELEZ.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO VERIFY THIS REPORT.  WE JUST
LEARNED THAT A FAMILY BY THE NAME OF DIAZ NAVARRO LIVES THERE.  THERE
WERE NO FATALITIES, BUT DAMAGE TO THE BUILDINGS ARE REPORTED.

   NEWSMAN CONTRERAS VELEZ, PRENSA LIBRE EDITOR AND AUTHOR OF THE
"CACTO" COLUMN, CAME TO THE AREA TO OBSERVE THE DAMAGE.  IT WAS
UNOFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED THAT SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LIVE IN THIS
SECTOR. MUNICIPAL FIREMEN HELPED POLICE AUTHORITIES IN COMBING THE
AREA AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS.

   THE RUMOR THAT A CAR BOMB EXPLODED ON 7TH AVENUE AND 7TH STREET,
ZONE 9, CIRCULATED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY.  LATER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT
THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY A BOOBY TRAP.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE ON
ALERT AND STEPPED UP OPERATIONS, A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID.

   AGAIN AT 2230 TONIGHT, NATIONAL POLICE EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS DISCOVERED
ANOTHER DEVICE IN THE VACANT LOT WHERE TWO OTHER BOMBS HAD GONE OFF
EARLIER.  TEN HOMES WERE DAMAGED BY ONE OF THE EXPLOSIONS, INCLUDING
THE HOMES OF DEPUTY FINANCES MINISTER GUSTAVO ADOLFO LEIVA AND
GUATEMALA GOVERNOR MARIO LOGORGON.  ONLY MATERIAL DAMAGE WAS CAUSED.
THE AREA RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE SITE.  ANOTHER CHARGE
WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE AIR FORCE'S MAIN GATE ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
THE FIRST BOMB WENT OFF.  AIR FORCE OFFICIALS CLOSED HINCAPIE AVENUE,
FROM LIBERACION BOULEVARD TO SANTA FE.  THE OFFICERS REPORTED MATERIAL
DAMAGE AND AND AN EXCHANGE OF FIRE IN THE AREA NEARBY.  FIREMEN AND
POLICEMEN AND SEVERAL ARMY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS PATROLLING THE
CITY ARE MAINTANING SECURITY.

   TEL AVIV (ISRAEL), 17 MAY 90 (HADASHOT) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL IRIAS RIVERA BY SHLOMO SLUTZKY]
[TEXT] WHEN HE BEGAN HIS JOB AS GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT AFTER DECADES OF
MILITARY REGIMES THAT LEFT BEHIND 100,000 FATALITIES, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRAT MARCO VINICIO AREVALO CEREZO HAD PROMISES FOR THE FUTURE AND
THINGS TO HIS CREDIT IN THE PAST. THE THINGS TO HIS CREDIT WERE FOUR
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HIM BECAUSE OF HIS ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE
DEMOCRACY IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HIS PROMISES WERE TO STOP POLITICAL
VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, AND MAINLY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXTREME
RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS.

   CEREZO HAS BEEN IN THIS POST FOR FIVE YEARS.  NEW ELECTIONS ARE TO
BE HELD SOON, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, SUPPORTED BY
ELEMENTS IN THE DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE NOT STOPPED.  THEY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF LABOR UNION LEADERS AND LEFTISTS.

   THE VISIT TO ISRAEL BY GUATEMALAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARIEL IRIAS
RIVERA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HIS
COUNTRY.  AFTER ALL, NO ONE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN IT.

   [SLUTZKY] BEFORE YOU CAME HERE, YOU SAID THAT YOU INTEND TO MAKE A
CONTRIBUTION HERE FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN BRINGING PEACE TO CENTRAL
AMERICA.  WHAT CAN THE MIDDLE EAST LEARN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA?

   [RIVERA] YOU CAN LEARN THAT PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT
VIOLENCE, THAT INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GUARANTEES ARE IMPORTANT.
IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE PROPOSITION TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE IS THE ONE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BRING PEACE TO YOUR AREA.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE AWARE OF THE LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
SITUATION IN OUR REGION, WHERE ALL THE PEOPLES HAVE THE SAME ORIGIN,
AND YOURS, WHERE NATIONAL, COMMUNITY, AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS ARE
INTERTWINED.

   [SLUTZKY] IT WAS SAID IN JERUSALEM THAT YOU HAVE NOT COME HERE TO
PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENT.  THAT SORT OF CLARIFICATION DOES NOT
USUALLY PRECEDE A VISIT BY A FOREIGN MINISTER TO ISRAEL.

   [RIVERA] IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WANTED TO CLARIFY AN ISSUE THAT
IS SELF-EVIDENT FOR US.  WITH US, WEAPON DEALS ARE CARRIED OUT BY
MILITARY PERSONNEL.

   [SLUTZKY] THE ISRAELI CHAPTER OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL WANTED TO
PRESENT YOU WITH A PETITION SIGNED BY HUNDREDS OF ISRAELIS DEMANDING
THAT HUMAN RIGHTS' ABUSE IN GUATEMALA IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BE
INVESTIGATED.

   [RIVERA] I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, BUT WE
FEEL IT IS OUTDATED TO USE TOOLS FROM A DICTATORIAL PAST ON PRESENT
REGIMES.  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS A POLICY THAT
IS DIFFERENT FROM ITS PREDECESSORS'.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE STILL ARE
CENTERS OF RIGHT-WING POWER IN OUR COUNTRY; THOSE GROUPS FEAR THE
STABILIZATION OF DEMOCRACY.

   [SLUTZKY] CEREZO PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN
GUATEMALA, INCLUDING ARMS AND DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY SALES.  HAS ANYTHING
BEEN DONE IN THAT RESPECT?

   [RIVERA] FROM WHAT I KNOW, ISRAEL SOLD WEAPONS TO GUATEMALA AT THE
FULL PRICE WHEN THE U.S. BOYCOTT WAS IN EFFECT AND OUR ARMY NEEDED
MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT THE GUERRILLAS.  OTHER THAN THAT, OUR
DECISION IS NOT TO SCRATCH THE WOUNDS OF THE PAST, BUT TO WORRY ABOUT
PEACE IN THE FUTURE.

   [SLUTZKY] CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE ONE WITH GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT WITHOUT COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE ARMY AND THOSE
CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH SQUADS.

   [RIVERA] THIS IS AN INCORRECT IMAGE.  I WOULD NOT SAY THAT IT IS
EASY TO OVERCOME ALL THE POWER ELEMENTS IN A FEW YEARS.  STILL, I CAN
SAY THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN THIS FIELD.  THE ARMY'S COMMAND
HEADED BY GENERAL GRAMAJO MORALES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER, GREATLY
ASSISTED THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION.

   [SLUTZKY] ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT TOOK PART IN THE COUPS NOT
CONNECTED TO THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING AND THE DEATH SQUADS WHICH
MURDERED HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, UNDER A
DEMOCRATIC REGIME?

   [RIVERA] IT IS VERY PROBABLE, BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THESE
ELEMENTS ARE A MINORITY, AFTER ALL.  THE OFFICERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN
THE FIRST COUP WERE PARDONED.  THE OFFICERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
SECOND COUP WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL.  I BELIEVE THIS INDICATES A
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

   [SLUTZKY] IN YOUR OPINION, WILL CEREZO BE ABLE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE
VOTERS IN A FEW MONTHS AND PROVE THAT HE HAS KEPT HIS PROMISES?

   [RIVERA] TO A LARGE EXTENT, YES.  ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEGUN;
POLITICAL AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ALLOWED; POLITICAL LEADERS
ARE NO LONGER SYSTEMATICALLY MURDERED AS IN THE PAST; AND THERE IS NO
VIOLENT SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC EXPRESSIONS.  CEREZO IS TRYING TO
PLAY THE DEMOCRATIC GAME ALL THE WAY.

   [JERUSALEM DOMESTIC SERVICE IN HEBREW AT 0400 GMT ON 17 MAY 90
REPORTS THAT "GUATEMALA WILL SET UP A CULTURAL CENTER IN JERUSALEM IN
THE BUILDING WHERE ITS CHANCERY WAS LOCATED UNTIL THE JERUSALEM LAW
WAS PASSED.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ITS SENSITIVE POSITION IN
INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE THE EMBASSY BACK

   MANILA (PHILIPPINES), 18 MAY 90 (MANILA BULLETIN) -- [ARTICLE]
[OLAF S. GIRON] [EXCERPT] THE UNHOLY UNION OF ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKERS
AND POLITICAL TERRORISTS HAS BECOME EVIDENT IN THE PHILIPPINES AS IN
OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PERU AND COLOMBIA, MILITARY AUTHORITIES SAID
YESTERDAY.

   VIOLENCE FUELED BY BIG DRUG PROFITS IS VIEWED AS A MAJOR THREAT TO
A NUMBER OF SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS, THEY ADDED.

   LAST MARCH, AUTHORITIES IN MANILA ARRESTED TWO NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY
(NPA) GUERRILLAS REPORTEDLY FROM THE ALEX BONCAYAO BRIGADE FOR
TRAFFICKING IN NARCOTICS.

   THE ARRESTS CAME AFTER A FOUR-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS THAT
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CPP) WAS INVOLVED IN DRUG
TRAFFICKING AS A MEANS TO SHORE UP RESOURCES FOR BUYING FIREARMS IN
VIEW OF DECLINING DONATIONS FROM SUPPORTERS IN EUROPE.

   FORTY-FOUR DECKS OF SHABU [METHAMPHETAMINE] WITH A STREET VALUE OF
P[PESO]154,000 WERE FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SUSPECTS.

   IN THE SAME MONTH, DRUG KINGPIN JOSE OYSON, ALSO KNOWN AS DON PEPE,
WAS KILLED WHILE GRAPPLING WITH POLICE AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN TO THE
NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (NBI) HEADQUARTERS FOR QUESTIONING.

   AFTER HIS ACQUITTAL FOR THE 1984 KILLING OF AN ANTI-DRUG CRUSADING
MANILA NEWSPAPER REPORTER, OYSON ALLEGEDLY ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS
WITH MAJOR DRUG SYNDICATE LEADERS IN HONG KONG AND TAIWAN.  HE ALSO
HAD BEEN UNDER SUSPICION OF FINANCING RIGHT-WING REVOLTS AGAINST
PRESIDENT AQUINO.

   THE ARRESTS OF THE TWO NPA GUERRILLAS PROVIDED THE FIRST HARD
EVIDENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES OF THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM THAT HAD ALREADY PLAGUED A NUMBER OF
GOVERNMENTS ELSEWHERE.

   AUTHORITIES SAID THEY ALSO SHOWED THAT ILLICIT DRUG PROFITS CAN
FUEL REVOLUTIONS FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT WITH EQUAL MAGNANIMITY AND
EVEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.

   AS A PRIME EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA, POWERFUL COCAINE LEADERS WHO
WORKED IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH COMMUNIST INSURGENTS 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO
HAVE TURNED AGAINST THE INSURGENTS AS THEIR STAGGERING DRUG PROFITS
ENABLED THEM TO BUY UP HUGE TRACTS OF RURAL FARM AND RANCH LAND AND
URBAN REAL ESTATE IN THE 1980S [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   MADRID (SPAIN), 17 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [EXCERPT] LIMA, 17 MAY (EFE) --
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT TODAY SAID THAT THE "TEMPORARY
WITHDRAWAL" FROM THE STRUGGLE ANNOUNCED BY THE "SHINING PATH" PERUVIAN
MAOIST GUERRILLA GROUP ON ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY IS A "PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR
OPERATION" INITIATED BY THE MILITARY.

   CIVILIAN SOURCES TOLD EFE THAT THE COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS RELEASED IN
AYACUCHO -- THE CRADLE OF THE "SHINING PATH" -- ANNOUNCING THE GROUP'S
TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE "IS FICTITIOUS AND WAS
RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCERTAINTY IN
THE RANKS OF THE SHINING PATH" AT A TIME WHEN TERRORIST ACTIONS WERE
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO MARK THE GROUP'S ANNIVERSARY.

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT CONFUSING THE
SHINING PATH COMMANDOS, WHO ARE DIVIDED AND HAVE NO CLEAR
COMMUNICATION AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH THEIR COMMANDING LEVELS. THE
SOURCES ADDED THAT THE COMMUNIQUE IS AIMED AT DELAYING OR ABORTING THE
ARMED ACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW.

   THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN ON "RED ALERT" IN AYACUCHO TODAY TO
PREVENT THE SHINING PATH FROM CELEBRATING ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH
PROPAGANDA ATTACKS RECALLING THE BEGINNING OF THE "PEOPLE'S WAR" ON 17
JUNE 1980, WHEN THE GROUP ATTACKED AN ELECTORAL COURT OFFICE IN AN
ANDEAN TOWN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN SUBURBAN AREAS OF AYACUCHO,
ANNOUNCED THAT THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCP) -- WHICH IS THE
OFFICIAL NAME OF THE SHINING PATH -- HAS "TEMPORARILY" WITHDRAWN FROM
THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND WILL REORGANIZE ITSELF TO RETURN WITH "NEW
IMPETUS."

   THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE COMMUNIQUE WAS ALSO CALLED INTO QUESTION BY
AYACUCHO JOURNALISTIC AND UNIVERSITY SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE.  THEY
NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT COMMUNIQUES HAVE BEEN
ATTRIBUTED TO THE SHINING PATH.

   "WE ARE TEMPORARILY WITHDRAWING FORM THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT WE
WILL CONTINUE THE IDEOLOGICAL FIGHT AND EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE
BRILLIANT ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE CARRIED OUT DURING THE PAST DECADE TO
RETURN ONCE AGAIN, WITH MORE IDEAS AND A DETERMINATION THAT WILL
PERMIT A STRATEGIC BALANCE UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES," THE COMMUNIQUE
STATES.

   "IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY THAT THE TIME FOR CRIME FOR THE SAKE OF
CRIME IS PASSED AND THAT THE CULT OF PERSONALITY IS ALSO OVER," IT
ADDS. CONTRARY TO STANDARD SHINING PATH PRACTICE, THE NOTE, WHICH IS
SIGNED BY THE "PCP-RANK-AND-FILE," DOES NOT MENTION THE MOVEMENT'S TOP
LEADER AND FOUNDER ABIMAEL GUZMAN, KNOWN BY HIS SUPPORTERS AS
"PRESIDENT GONZALO." SPECIALISTS BELIEVE THAT THIS PHRASE IS AN ATTACK
AGAINST THE MORE MILITARIST SECTOR OF THE SHINING PATH AND AGAINST
GUZMAN, AND THAT IT SEEKS TO FOMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE SHINING PATH.

   SOME SPECIALISTS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP HAVE SAID THAT
THERE IS A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MORE MODERATE SECTOR, KNOWN AS
THE "BLACK" WING, AND THE "RED" ORTHODOX, MILITARIST WING. OTHER
OBSERVERS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE ONLY "FISSURES" CONCERNING
OPERATIONAL METHODS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

[CARLOS VARGAS] [TEXT] THE PRESUMED SUBVERSIVE GROUP M-20 [20 DECEMBER
MOVEMENT] THREATENED ON 15 MAY TO ENTER THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND FREE
THE REFUGEES THERE.  IT ALSO CALLED SEVERAL MEDIA CLAIMING THAT IT HAD
KIDNAPPED A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND PLACED BOMBS IN SEVERAL GOVERNMENT
OFFICES.

   IN VIEW OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS, THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH FOREIGN
MINISTER JULIO LINARES, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS STRENGTHENED POLICE
PROTECTION AROUND THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN THIS CAPITAL.

   FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS GONZALO GONZALEZ AND
HERACLIDES SUCRE, CLOSE COLLABORATORS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL MANUEL
NORIEGA, ARE REFUGEES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  GONZALEZ IS ALLEGEDLY
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TRIED
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO OVERTHROW NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.  FOREIGN
MINISTER LINARES REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAD RECEIVED TWO
TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS M-20
MEMBERS AND THREATENED TO ENTER THE EMBASSY GROUNDS TO FREE THE
REFUGEES THERE.

   SECURITY AROUND THE EMBASSY WAS REINFORCED, ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN
STRENGTHENED EARLIER AFTER SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THE FORMER REGIME
SOUGHT ASYLUM THERE.

   MEANWHILE, THE DIRECTOR OF THE "INSTITUTO AMERICA" HIGH SCHOOL
DENIED THE M-20'S CLAIM THAT IT WAS HOLDING, AND THREATENED TO KILL, A
STUDENT FROM THAT SCHOOL.

   ALSO ON 15 MAY, PANAMANIAN AND AMERICAN POLICEMEN HAD TO ORDER THE
EVACUATION OF WORKERS FROM SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN THE BANKING
AREA OF VIA ESPANA DUE TO REPORTED BOMB THREATS FROM THE M- 20.

   THE M-20 ALLEGEDLY IS A GROUP OF SUPPORTERS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL
NORIEGA WHO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE
"MY PLACE" BAR.  ONE U.S. SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND 20 PANAMANIANS WERE
WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.

   FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID THAT HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE
EXISTENCE OF THE M-20.

   A NUMBER OF DAYS AGO THE SOUTHERN COMMAND OFFERED A $10,000 REWARD
TO ANY PERSON WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE
MAN WHO THREW THE BOMB INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED BAR.

   IT WAS ALSO LEARNED THAT THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE ARE TRYING
TO TRACE THE TELEPHONE CALLS, WHICH HAVE SCARED THE CITIZENS SOMEWHAT.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, WHO HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY, WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE DEATH OF
YOUNG MELQUIADES RODRIGUEZ JUSTINE, A GRANDSON OF FORMER COLONEL
JUSTINE.

SALVADORAN RIGHT-WING POLITICAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION IN
GUATEMALA OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND HIS
COMPANION GILDA FLORES IN LATE JANUARY.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE MIRAFLORES
[PRESIDENTIAL] PALACE, CEREZO SAID HE WILL DELIVER A DETAILED REPORT
ON THIS CASE TO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, TO SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL, AND TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH HE REQUESTED
ALL THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO IDENTIFY AND DETAIN THE ASSASSINS.

   REFERRING TO THE TALKS BEING HELD WITH THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT TO
RENEGOTIATE IN CONCEPT THE OIL DEBT THAT GUATEMALA HAS WITH VENEZUELA
-- WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT -- CEREZO SAID
PRESIDENT PEREZ HAD ACCEPTED THE [RESTRUCTURING] PROPOSAL.  HOWEVER,
THE TERMS ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED.

   THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED 20 YEARS TO PAY THE DEBT, A
SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AND A FOUR-YEAR [GRACE PERIOD] ON THE INTEREST.
THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT (WHICH ALONG
WITH VENEZUELA PARTICIPATES IN THE OIL SUPPLY AGREEMENT).  THE
PROPOSAL WILL THEN BE PRESENTED AT THE UPCOMING CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS SUMMIT.

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH VENEZUELAN AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,
THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT, WHO ARRIVED ON 17 MAY IN VENEZUELA, SAID
THAT TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE
GRADUAL DEMILITARIZATION, WITH THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN WEAPONS AND
LOCAL ARMIES, "WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT UNSUITED TO CARRY OUT EXTERNAL
ATTACKS."

   CONCERNING NICARAGUA, CEREZO SAID THE PROFESSIONALIZATION AND
IDEOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARMY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REAFFIRMING ITS

   THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20

   HAVANA (CUBA), 18 MAY 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] NINE YEARS AGO TODAY, THEN ECUADORAN PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA DIED WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED WHILE ON A FLIGHT TO THE INTERIOR
OF HIS COUNTRY. THE SMALL PLANE SUFFERED THE ACCIDENT WHILE FLYING THE
PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, AND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HIGH- RANKING ARMY
OFFICERS FROM QUITO TO LOJA PROVINCE.  ALL OF THEM DIED.  THE
RELATIVES OF THE LATE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE PLANE
CRASHED ACCIDENTALLY AND FILED CHARGES AS PRIVATE CITIZENS, BUT THE
CASE WAS LATER CLOSED.

   DOUBTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ACCIDENT, AND THE CASE RESURFACED AGAIN WHEN A NEW INVESTIGATION WAS
OPENED AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES DISCLOSED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
PARTICIPATION BY THE U.S. CIA IN THE DEATH OF ROLDOS AND HIS RETINUE.
ERNESTO BUENANO, ROLDOS' POLITICAL ADVISER, ASSERTED BEFORE A
MULTIPARTY COMMISSION OF THE ECUADORAN CONGRESS THAT THE PLANE
ACCIDENT IN WHICH THE FORMER PRESIDENT DIED DID NOT RESULT FROM HUMAN
ERROR OR TECHNICAL FAILURE BUT FROM SABOTAGE, WHICH CONSISTED OF
CONTAMINATING THE PLANE'S FUEL TO CAUSE ITS ENGINES TO STALL.  THE
WITNESS POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS
AND URGED THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING FUEL TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE.

   IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ROLDOS' ADMINISTRATION WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY A PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BY
HIS DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS OPENLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF NICARAGUA AND THE SALVADORAN
INSURGENTS.  HIS ADOPTION OF THIS STANCE LED U.S.  IMPERIALISM TO
CONSIDER THE ROLDOS DOCTRINE AS A DANGER TO ITS INTERESTS.

   WHEN ONE RECALLS THE POSITION OF THE FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT,
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FORMER PANAMANIAN LEADER OMAR TORRIJOS HERRERA
ALSO COMES TO MIND.  TORRIJOS' DEATH WAS SIMILAR IN CIRCUMSTANCES TO
THAT OF JAIME ROLDOS, AND HIS PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HIS
COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY WAS ALSO SIMILAR.  TORRIJOS AND ROLDOS WERE A
NUISANCE TO U.S. PLANS IN LATIN AMERICA AND BOTH WERE MURDERED, AS
VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE DISCLOSED.  FORMER CHILEAN PRESIDENT SALVADOR
ALLENDE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CIA'S HAND
DIRECTLY TOOK HIS LIFE, THE ORGANIZATION DID HELP DESTABILIZE HIS
PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT.

   THE INVESTIGATIONS ON JAIME ROLDOS' DEATH AND WHAT WAS SAID AT THE
TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT SUFFERED BY OMAR TORRIJOS REVEAL ONCE
MORE THE SINISTER PLANS OF THE U.S. CIA AGAINST OUR LATIN AMERICAN AND
CARIBBEAN PEOPLE, WHO MUST REMAIN ON THE ALERT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SPOKESMAN
HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION
OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA
COMMANDOS.

   THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO
GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO
MARTINEZ.  MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME
SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 (1230 GMT)
TODAY.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN
SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT
TIME OF DAY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT.

   THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
OF OPTIMISM.  ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR,
WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.  


DEV-MUC3-1297 (BOEING)

   SANTIAGO, 21 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [ARTICLE] [NELSON SANDOVAL] [TEXT]
CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN WILL TODAY REPORT ON THE FIRST 70
DAYS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND WILL MAKE IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS
CONCERNING HIS FUTURE PLANS IN A SPEECH TO A PLENARY MEETING OF THE
CHILEAN CONGRESS THAT WILL MARK THE BEGINNING OF SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL
SESSIONS.

   AYLWIN'S SPEECH AWAKENS CONSIDERABLE EXPECTATION BECAUSE OF RECENT
UNPUBLICIZED CLASHES BETWEEN AYLWIN'S ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL
AUGUST PINOCHET, WHO HAS BEEN THROWING HIS WEIGHT AROUND AS COMMANDER
IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY, AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GROWING RIGHTWING
OPPOSITION TO THE ACTIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION.

   POLITICAL ANALYSTS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH
WILL COINCIDE WITH THE "END OF A GOVERNMENT-OPPOSITION HONEYMOON" THAT
HAD MARKED THE INITIAL WEEKS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

   THE ADMINISTRATION'S INITIATIVES REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS, TAX
REFORM, THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND OTHER STEPS
AIMED AT DEPRIVING MILITARY COURTS OF THEIR POWERS HAVE WORSENED THE
CONFLICT AND HAVE MADE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT FOR AYLWIN'S
ADMINISTRATION.

   THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE, WHILE THE RIGHTWING PARTIES ARE LEANING
MORE AND MORE TOWARD PINOCHET EVERY DAY AND LONGING FOR HIS
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THE LEFTWING PARTIES AND EVEN SECTORS OF THE
COALITION OF PARTIES FOR DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING AYLWIN FOR
ALLEGED "LUKEWARM" APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC
CHANGES THAT HE PROMISED DURING HIS ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.

   THE RIGHTWING HAS TAKEN DUE ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL UNSOLVED TERRORIST
ATTACKS OVER THE RECENT WEEKS TO PROP UP ITS OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS TO
BILLS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS.

   HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO RECENT OPINION POLLS, AYLWIN WILL MAKE HIS
SPEECH AMID GROWING POPULARITY, MUCH HIGHER THAN THE SUPPORT HE
OBTAINED AT THE 14 DECEMBER ELECTIONS.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS AT THE LEGISLATIVE PALACE IN
VALPARAISO, 125 KM WEST OF SANTIAGO, WILL MARK THE RETURN TO A LONG-STANDING
DEMOCRATIC TRADITION THAT CHILEANS USED TO ENJOY EVERY 21 MAY.

   ON THIS DAY, THE REPORT TO CONGRESS WAS YET ANOTHER REASON FOR
POPULAR REJOICING BECAUSE IT COINCIDED WITH THE "NAVAL GLORIES DAY"
WHICH IS ALSO COMMEMORATED ON 21 MAY IN MEMORY OF THE CHILE'S TOP
NAVAL HERO ARTURO PRAT WHO DIED IN THE NAVAL BATTLE OF IQUIQUE DURING
THE 1879 PACIFIC WAR.

   SINCE CONGRESS WAS CLOSED DOWN DURING THE MILITARY REGIME, GENERAL
AUGUSTO PINOCHET USED TO READ HIS STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS ON 11
SEPTEMBER, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY COUP D'ETAT THROUGH WHICH
HE SEIZED POWER.

   ACCORDING TO POLITICAL ANALYSTS, AYLWIN'S SPEECH MAY PROVIDE THE
KEY TO THE LAYOUT OF CHILE'S TRANSITION IN THE FUTURE.  THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE HIS REPORT IS RATHER CURIOUS BECAUSE
THEORETICALLY THIS REPORT SHOULD ENCOMPASS ONE YEAR OF GOVERNMENT,
WHILE AYLWIN HAS BEEN PRESIDENT FOR ONLY 70 DAYS DURING WHICH THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HARSHLY CRITICIZED BY THE RIGHTWING EVERY TIME
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD SOMETHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRIOR MILITARY
REGIME.

   GENERAL PINOCHET PERSONALLY TOLD AYLWIN THAT HE FELT OFFENDED BY
AYLWIN'S LABOR DAY CELEBRATION SPEECH ON 1 MAY.

   DURING HIS LATEST PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, PINOCHET TOLD
AYLWIN THAT HE FELT THAT THE "TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION
THAT AYLWIN HAD CREATED TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING
THE MILITARY REGIME WAS A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE ARMY.

   PINOCHET ALSO TOLD AYLWIN THAT BY WAY OF "PROTEST" AGAINST THESE
ACTIONS HE WOULD NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAD
INVITED ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMED FORCES BRANCHES.

   ACCORDING TO LEAKS ABOUT THIS MEETING, AYLWIN TOLD PINOCHET: "WATCH
YOUR STEP, GENERAL" AND REMINDED HIM THAT OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR AGAINST
THE PRESIDENT COULD HARM PINOCHET'S IMAGE EVEN WITHIN HIS OWN
INSTITUTION, THE ARMY.

   PINOCHET DID NOT ATTEND THE LUNCHEON, HOWEVER, SENDING INSTEAD
GENERAL HUGO SALAS, THE THIRD HIGHEST-RANKING ARMY OFFICER AND THE
FORMER CHIEF OF THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER], THE SECRET
POLICE OF HIS REGIME.

   PINOCHET FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL AND TO MAKE THIS COUNCIL ISSUE A STATEMENT AGAINST THE "TRUTH
AND RECONCILIATION" COMMISSION, BUT PINOCHET'S SORTIE IN THE POLITICAL
ARENA AWOKE CONCERN LACED WITH FEAR, AS ONE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
ADMITTED TO EFE.  THE SOURCE, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, ADDED
THAT "PINOCHET IS AWARE OF THE FEAR HE AWAKENS AND HE USES IT
ADROITLY."

   THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT ATTEND THE TODAY'S CEREMONY IN
CONGRESS ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDERS OF THE OTHER ARMED FORCES BRANCHES,
THE VERY SAME ONES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT HIS ATTEMPT TO CONVOKE THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WILL BE PRESENT.

   PINOCHET CLAIMED THAT HE HAS "INSTITUTIONAL REASONS" FOR HIS
ABSENCE AND HAS LEFT FOR NORTHERN CHILE WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY TOURING
ARMY GARRISONS.

   ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE "PINOCHET EFFECT" WILL BE NOTICEABLE IN
AYLWIN'S SPEECH THROUGH GREATER MODERATION IN ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND THROUGH MORE BENIGN ASSESSMENTS OF THE
PREVIOUS MILITARY REGIME.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] INFORMS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:

   1.  SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE INITIATION OF THE CARACAS MEETING ON 16
MAY, THE ARMED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE WITH AERIAL
BOMBINGS, MASSIVE ARTILLERY ATTACKS, AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF
PARATROOPERS AND INFANTRY SOLDIERS TO ALL OUR RURAL FRONTS.  FOLLOWING
FIVE DAYS OF INTENSE COMBAT, WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IT IS A ROUTINE
OPERATION AND NOT A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE.

   2.  OUR FORCES HAVE REJECTED THE ENEMY'S GENERAL OFFENSIVE AND TO
DATE HAVE DOWNED ONE HELICOPTER, DAMAGED TWO OTHERS, AND INFLICTED
DOZENS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ENEMY TROOPS.  WE DENY THAT COMMANDER
LEONCIO PICHINTE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT.

   3.  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE FMLN OF HAVING VIOLATED THE
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TALKS, CRISTIANI AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
PROCESS HAVE BEEN MAKING A SERIES OF STATEMENTS CONCERNING
CONFIDENTIAL ISSUES.

   4.  FROM THE SIGNING OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS
INCREASED ITS INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO VENCEREMOS AND RADIO FARABUNDO
MARTI, WHICH REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS. IT CANNOT STAND TO
HAVE OUR POSITIONS KNOWN.  THEREFORE, THERE IS CLEARLY NO FREEDOM OF
EXPRESSION, WHICH IN TURN DELAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE
BECAUSE IT HINDERS THE NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED IN ORDER TO REACH A
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   5.  FROM THE ABOVE SITUATION, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
USED THE CARACAS MEETING AS PART OF A WAR PLAN, WITH CRISTIANI
PARTICIPATING AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE LEVEL WITH A VIEW TO
POINTING OUT THE CONTRADICTORINESS OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL ACTIVITY.

   WITH THE NEGOTIATION AND THE INTERFERENCE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS,
THE FMLN HAS SILENCED THE CONFIDENTIALITY ARGUMENT, WHILE THE ARMY IS
TRYING TO MILITARILY ANNIHILATE US AND IS OPENLY PROCLAIMING IT BY
SAYING THAT IT HAS ATTACKED COMMAND POSTS AND KILLED FMLN LEADERS.

   6.  THE FMLN REITERATES THAT AS LONG AS A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT AGREED
UPON THROUGH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT THAT WILL END THE ARMY'S IMPUNITY,
AND SPECIFIC PLEDGES ARE NOT MADE TO DEMILITARIZE THE COUNTRY, IT
RESERVES THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF EVEN BY LAUNCHING
OFFENSIVES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR SCOPE, WHENEVER NECESSARY ANYWHERE
WITHIN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   BOGOTA, 21 MAY 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT
A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN.  TERRORIST
ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,
AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE
ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST
COLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY
DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.

   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW
TODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER
FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF
MEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY
AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED
TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND
BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO
ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN
AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH
THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM
FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL
AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF
THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME
COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY
YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF
ANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY
NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,
I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL
COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH
TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A
DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE
SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE
EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE
SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;
IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.

   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
COOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,
OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE
VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO
ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS
ENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS.

   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE
DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT
COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN
TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.  THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH
NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S
FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT
ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM
OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION.

   FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME OF
SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER.
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE,
FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  GOOD NIGHT.

   QUITO, 21 MAY 90 (RADIO QUITO) -- [REPORT] [ALVARO GOMEZ] [TEXT]
ALL MEDIA IN GUAYAQUIL AND MANY CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE
PORT OF GUAYAQUIL TO COVER THE FOURTH ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT [AVC]
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ARE STILL UNAWARE OF WHERE THE MEETING IS BEING
HELD.  THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THIS GROUP WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING.  THE FOUR-DAY MEETING BEGAN ON 18 MAY AT
THE GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING WAS CONTINUED
LATER AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL.  DURING THEIR SESSIONS,
IN ADDITION TO MAKING A DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS, AVC
LEADERS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE AGREEMENT THEY SIGNED A YEAR AGO WITH THE
PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA GOVERNMENT.  THE ACCORD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THEM TO CEASE THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE
WITH SOCIAL SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE
FOURTH AVC NATIONAL CONFERENCE, AVC LEADER SANTIAGO DILLMAN REPORTED
ON 18 MAY THAT THE FINAL DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS WAS A
LOGICAL STEP -- AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ARMED
STRUGGLE IN ECUADOR AND IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE
PROPER COURSE.  THEREFORE, HE ANNOUNCED, THIS ALFARIST MEETING WILL
ALSO ANALYZE THE DECISION TO ORGANIZE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY OR TO
ALLOW AVC LEADERS TO JOIN AN ALREADY EXISTING GROUP RECOGNIZED BY THE
SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.

   THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE AGENDA OF THE AVC MEETING,
WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE ON 21 OR 22 MAY WITH A HISTORICAL
RESOLUTION.  HOWEVER, AVC LEADERS -- AMONG THEM SANTIAGO DILLMAN,
MARCO TROYA, PEDRO MONCADA, AND JANETH SOSA -- HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO
DISCLOSE THE SITE OF THE MEETING, WHICH HAS FRUSTRATED THE WORK OF
JOURNALISTS.  THE AVC LEADERS PLAN TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF
DELIVERING WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AVC MEMBERS TO A SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN A CEREMONY SIMILAR TO ONE RECENTLY HELD BY
THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT IN COLOMBIA, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS STAGED
SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MILITARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF
BUSINESSMAN NAIM ISAIAS WITH THE HELP OF THE AVC.

   THE AVC HAS SAID IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S
INSTITUTIONAL LIFE.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL PLEDGE TO SURRENDER
ITS WEAPONS -- THE SYMBOL OF ITS REBELLION -- WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE
WITH OR WITHOUT WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS HAVE SAID.  THE AVC LEADERS
CONTINUE MEETING AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL AND EXPECT TO
REACH AN AGREEMENT SOON ON LAYING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD THEN
BE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY.
